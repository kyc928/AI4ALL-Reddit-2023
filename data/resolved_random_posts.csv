15aalqm,"Shoulder blade tingling?
Male, 23, UK, weight roughly 210/220 pounds, Height 5ft 10/11, I drink some weekends and i'm starting to limit smoking weed to the weekends aswell.

Hey!

So in my post history, I made a post on a panic attack subreddit about my first time with a weed induced panic attack, which made me go to the hospital. 

Ever since then though, I have been getting tingling in my shoulder blade/back, I had a mini panic attack yesterday and ive noticed its kind of came back. It happens randomly throughout the day and it'll last for anywhere between 5 to 20 minutes.

Probably quite obvious, but is this just something that could be related to anxiety? It just seems like a weird symptom to get",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15aalqm/shoulder_blade_tingling/,23.0,,

Male, 25, 180cm, 85kg.


Hello everyone. 
Short story - About 3 hours ago my food poisoning  symptoms kicked in. I’ve had some burgers and apparently they were old or something. Now I’ve got a diarrhea, I’m vomiting, I’m extremely cold even though it’s 30C outside and my body temperature is 37,9 C.
About a week ago I’ve starting taking anxiety reducing medication that my doctor prescribed me. (Eglonyl around 150mg and mirthazipone 15mg ).
My main symptom was heart palpitations, every kind of it. Sometimes it feels like I’m sinking for a second when my heart skips the beat, or it gives me an additional beat, or I’m feeling the heart rate very loud and clear in my throat and sometimes entire body. I don’t really feel dizziness, only feeling of being sinked down. I’ve run some tests and doctors said that my heart was fine except I’ve got 1st degree of mirtal heart prolapse, which they said isn’t a disease or anything but an anomaly. When heart palpitations happening I feel like I’m going to die for a few seconds, then everything becomes fine.
So right now, when I’m vomiting, my body is getting very tensed. And I feel those palpitations once or twice, they become more ugly and I’m starting ti fear more. Should I be worried?

15a5z4y,"23, low libido and worse erections, test of 375. next steps...
Hi -  
  
  
Had decaying libido for the past year so got a test for total T on the NHS, came back at 375 to which my GP said was fine and to basically go away, I think it's stopped decaying now to the point where I can have sex around 4 times a week not counting when I try and force it. not going to go on TRT as I'm still young and would rather try natural stuff first. Also don't get morning wood and random erections anymore, erection quality is generally poorer. In fact it's pretty difficult to get erections at all (just watched a video of me fucking my gf and nothing really happened, however this could just be psychological because I'm thinking about it in relation to this a lot). No other low T symptoms, have a great gf and everything is good on relationship front (apart from low sex drive). After a couple of months of trying this plan I will pay for a full test.  
  
6""1 and 12.5 stone, have put on about 10lbs over the past year. I'm fairly naturally built and don't have a massive amount of bodyfat, not as if I'm a 6""1 twig with all my weight hanging off as fat.  
  
Quit weed just over a month ago after smoking around 0.25g a day for the past year, made absolutely no difference to any part of my life, although I was definitely addicted and had cravings.  
  
Haven't drank in a few days after getting this test, intending to cut down to 1 or 2 days a week of medium drinking (3-4 pints). Was drinking this almost daily before.  
  
Have ordered Zinc, Magnesium, D3+K2, and Boron - not expecting to be a magic pill but might help.  
  
I'm not interested in lifting so will start doing cardio, chopping wood etc.  
  
Sleep was also a big thing, I think I've probably been on 6-7 hours 5 days a week for the last year, going to try and up this to 8 hours every day instead of just weekends.  
  


does this plan look good for the moment?

15acorj,"Extreme bloating and unbearable stomach pain- please help


Hi. 22F, currently only take migraine medicine on as as needed basis. 
Monday morning, I woke up with severe stomach pain. I went and had a bowel movement, nothing seemed abnormal. However, the pain didn’t go away, if anything it got worse. This was followed by nausea and vomiting. The entire day I felt unwell and slept. Woke up tuesday morning, felt better no nausea however stomach pain was back. When i went to shower i notice my abdominal area was extremely swollen. I decided to take a trip to urgent care. The doctor told me it was most likely acid related, and to take 2 pepcids a day for a week. They did a urine test however, and found microscopic traces of blood( meaning, on the test the result showed up as large amounts but you could not see it in the urine with the naked eye). He said this is most likely menstrual related, but i’m not due for another week or so. I’ve taken the pepcid, however the swelling has gotten worse. I noticed it seems to flare up after I’ve eaten something (i’ve only been consuming toast bananas applesauce and soup). Currently it’s the worst it’s been and hard to the touch. It feels like i constantly need to go to the bathroom, however i can’t pass stool (can still pass gas though with difficulty )I thought it might be a bad bout of constipation and took some sennosides, and I did have a bowel movement. The pain and swelling is still very much there. The pain is extreme and cramp like, and happens anywhere from my upper abdomen down to my belly button. My biggest concern is a bowel obstruction. I’m not sure whether or not I should go back to urgent care or wait for a gastroenterologist appointment (ideally i’d avoid it because i’m s student and hospital bills are expensive, but health is a priority of course)",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15acorj/extreme_bloating_and_unbearable_stomach_pain/,22.0,,

15aez9o,"Irrational insomnia fear [20M]
Hi all! 

Two and a half years ago, I had a sleepless night and couldn’t sleep well the night after that, so had to take medication to help me fall asleep. In the months after that I didn’t function very well because I had unknowingly developed a fear of not being able to sleep, and dying because of that. 

I know it’s completely irrational, and I’m still seeing a therapist and take some meds to keep my anxiety in check. And it’s pretty much under control, and I sleep well. However, occasionally I do still have moments in which the anxiety resurfaces, and have emergency medication if I really need to take it. 

But my question to you is… because it’s never a bad idea to look for further confirmation. Is there a chance, or how big is the chance that I could die of not being able to sleep? 

Your answer might help me find some calm when I’m tossing and turning and can’t find any sleep… and worry about not being able to sleep.

I’m a 28 yo female, 220lbs. I get the recommended 150 minutes of cardio a week and eat a vegan low salt diet (husband is older and has hypertension I’ve not been recommended a low salt diet). Last weekend I was running errands and felt light headed, nauseous and having heart palpitations and generally felt like death warmed over. Did a full set of vitals when I got home and checked my blood sugar (not diabetic just a nurse and didn’t see the need to go to the ED before ruling out what I could at home). Everything was WNL except my BP that was 160/120. Took my PRN Xanax incase it was just anxiety and rechecked after thirty minutes when it went up to 180/130 Went to the ED and they did a EKG which was normal except for tachycardia which has been my baseline since childhood (I run 80-90 but was a bit anxious in the ED so it was 105). They ran an electrolyte panel and troponin levels which where all normal. Sent me home with a diagnosis of anxiety because they could see in my chart that I have a GAD diagnosis. I’ve monitored my BP over the last week and it’s been around 170/120 except one night where it was 200/140 (checked twice with my electric cuff and then made my husband take a manual pressure all with the same results). I have an apt with my primary next week but I want to be prepared to advocate for myself before then because at my last physical she put in my chart that I don’t exercise (without even asking me if I did which I do) and that my diet “needs improvement” because I told her I am early in eating disorder recovery so all diet advice needs to be filtered through my ED coach (who she did not reach out to). I’m afraid she’s also just going to fob it off as anxiety or a diet/exercise problem like the ED did. Would I be within my rights as a patient to request Methyldopa?

15a9mal,"What might my partner have and what can I do to help?
30F AMAB, Height: 166cm Weight 73kg
Medications: Methylphenidate (2022-present)

Hi there, my partner and I are from the North East of England, UK. I'm posting on behalf of my partner with her permission.

In early 2021, my partner had sprained her arm trying to clean around the house, and it was taking a while to heal. She became frustrated and impatient and tried to do some stretches to elieviate the pain. In doing so, she twisted and pulled her back in some way.

What that led to is the past couple of painful years, with very consistent symptoms happening every day.

- She has pain on her left side, not her chest but not her back either. It's worsened with anxiety, and it feels like a constant pressure, tightening feeling. 
- This is accompanied by her left foot tingling, especially when putting pressure on the nearest affected area, either on her back or on her chest.
- Her body temperature can change drastically, and when she has a 'movement' of something around her injury, she can break out in a sweat suddenly. 
- The severity of her pain can impair her breathing a little.
- As it is constant this also causes her to feel tired a lot. 

So far she has done tons of stretching exercises consistently every day, taken NSAIDs (Ibuprofen mostly, she has been prescribed naproxen but she can't take it as it contains excipient she is intolerant to--yippee.), been to see a chiropractor multiple times, has self referred to MSK to try and get help, and has requested help from NHS 111 multiple times. She has had plenty of rest, has done various kinds of cardio exercise (Walks, rock climbing at my gym) , and we have continuously checked and adjusted her posture. I've provided massages to the best of my ability also. Her symptoms remain consistent, with good days and bad days.

When I've searched up the symptoms they always seem to line up either with costochondritis, or radiculopathy (pinched nerve), but we have had no formal diagnosis. Honestly, getting any kind of scan or assessment beyond a general check has been impossible. We have ruled out heart, lungs and such, as she has had an £CG and her lungs checked.

r/ChronicPain have also suggested potentials, static nerve problems, scoliosis, hEDS or a herniated disc (Which would line up with Radiculopathy) 

The part that has me absolutely stumped is the foot tingling response. That would indicate nerve, but from my, admittedly novice, reading on the matter, the nerves for the legs and feet travel down from the lower spine, but this is upper back/chest pain, so a link doesn't seem to exist there, but I may be wrong. We have another telephone appointment with our local MSK in August, and I'm going to try and get her approved for scans with a view towards some kind of diagnosis.

I wanted to ask here. With these kinds of symptoms, and given all she is doing to try and find relief, what can she do? Is there something I've overlooked in my research? Has anyone experienced anything similar, and found a way to mitigate or even prevent the pain?

Again, we're in the UK, so access to various services can be... different, in our 'NHS way'. Any and all advice is super appreciated, and if I need to clarify anything I'll respond to any questions or anything as best as I can.

I just want some signposts, if anything, to try and convince our doctors and practitioners in our area to do more than tell her to keep doing the same stretches she's been doing for over two years now.

I just want to do something to help, because as hard as we try the doctors haven't done a thing to help her.

46 year old male, 5’11” approx 200 lbs. 

Non-smoker, no recreational drugs.  Unfortunately he is a heavy/binge drinker. He’ll drink until he passes out (or is close to it) 3-4 nights in a row, abstain from drinking for 3-4 days and then repeat the cycle.  This has been going on for 10+ years.  He often tries to quit drinking but has never been successful for more than a few weeks. He has never sought professional help for his drinking. 

He has medication resistant high blood pressure, currently controlled by two prescriptions and a water pill. He takes Effexor daily for anxiety and fish oil and magnesium supplements daily. 

Over the past few months he has been getting sick to his stomach and vomiting daily, often 2-3 times per day - even on his non-drinking days.  He often complains of getting overheated just prior to vomiting, regardless of the actual temperature. Heat has never bothered him before.  He gets heartburn from time to time but doesn’t take medication for it. 

He is lacking energy. He used to be fairly active - playing golf, hiking, riding a bike etc but those activities have decreased greatly in the past year.  He doesn’t get out of breath but he often has to stop and rest even after doing normal household chores, etc.  When we were on vacation last month he was exhausted after walking around for a few hours and admitted he had zero energy and felt like he could sleep for days. He hadn’t been drinking the week of the trip. 

He bruises very easily.  He always has to an extent but it’s far worse.  This past weekend we assembled and moved some heavy furniture in our house and his arms and legs are now covered in large, deep purple bruises.  He did not fall or injure himself to my knowledge. I was doing the same work as him and I have none.

He knows something is wrong and says he’ll call the doctor but he never does.  I think he’s scared.

It’s usually the worst in the morning, and I do what I can to clear the mucus but it usually comes back by mid day.

I drink multiple cups of water a day. I also try to limit my dairy consumption as I know it’ll just make it worse. 

I brought this up to my doctor at my last checkup a few years back, as a result, she just examined my mouth/throat and suggested to me that it was probably caused by acid reflux and prescribed me omeprazole which did not help. And as much as I’ve tried limiting certain foods, my nose/throat condition remains the same.

15adwr3,"Awful tachycardia after eating.
I’m 21 and this started earlier this year. After I eat anything than plain protein (example: eggs) I get horrible tachycardia after about 25-30 minutes. I have been diagnosed with sinus tachycardia and ibs, both doctors told me it’s from my anxiety and I get that. But I don’t see how the tachycardia is from my anxiety?? I seriously CANNOT move after I eat and I don’t even eat a lot, I get full easily. I’ve done multiple blood work and they all come back normal. All the doctors keep telling me it’s just my anxiety. There are times it’s absolutely horrible and I cannot even move without my heart rate to skyrocket even up to 140 and there are times that it’s better and I don’t notice it that much. 

One thing I thought about is rapid gastric emptying or extreme gas build up due to my ibs that pushes everything together. Another thing that’s in my mind is POTS which a friend doctor has told me before I may have it but it’s not an official diagnosis.

Hello everyone,  
This is a trash account, because I don't want to be associated with my illness. I also put a ""NSFW"" flair because I'm going to talk about my ass.  
I'm 21M, from France, 80 kilograms, 1.80 metres, I work out, I don't smoke (for 3 years), I rarely drink alcohol and I don't do drugs.  
So, I've had hemorrhoidal problems and anal fissures for over 2 years now. At first I was careful to drink more water, then I was careful to eat more fiber, until today when I'm forced to take a laxative (macrogol) morning, and sometimes evening, to avoid anal fissure or hemorrhoids.  
I often, very often, have a tingling sensation around my anus, which heats up and often occurs after I've gone to the toilet, and the damage is magnified if I've forgotten to take my laxative. Besides, I've been cleaning my rear end with wipes for a long time now. And if one day I have the misfortune of wiping myself with toilet paper, the pain and discomfort are multiplied. So I'm forced to take my wipes with me.  
I'm well aware that hemorrhoids and anal fissures occur when our stools are too hard, when we don't eat enough fiber, don't drink enough water, eat spicy food and stay in the toilet too long. So of course, I take all these precautions to avoid future pain. And for the record, my stools are not hard, and not too complicated to expel.  
I saw several specialists. One told me it could be due to my perineum not being muscular enough. In fact, he also explained that it can happen when you do weight training (like me) or cycling. I didn't see any other sources talking about it. I also had a colonoscopy, and nothing abnormal (at least I'm safe that way!).  
I also understand that ass hairs can irritate the anus, and that seems quite logical in my case.  
So now, despite all the precautions I'm taking, I'd like to be able to rest easy and no longer have my anus irritated, stinging and burning.

After my gallbladder removal with complications (bile leak due to an accessory bile duct) and 2 ERCPs for placing a stent and removal of stent (which caused acute pancreatitis in october 2022) i have on going problems with:

yellow diarrhea, stomach pain, pain in the ribs,  problems with digestion (diarrhea or constipation), my upper belly is always bloated, only tolerate small amount of foods now, feeling full very quick.

Lipase is slightly elevated (86 U/L), liver levels are normal, elevated lactate levels, slightly lower eGFR levels, protein in urin since many years (maybe kidney related problems? Kidneys do look normal tho but i have a very small cyst).

Why is my Lipase elevated?
It's always elevated when i'm in pain but my doctors say i don't have chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic insufficiency.

MRI was made twice, pancreas looks normal.
MRCP was not possible because i start to struggle with breathing.

I live in germany and our gastroentologists mostly do endoscopies now. No one wants to treat me for my on going issues.

I may get an apppointment for a ""pancreas center"" but i have to wait 8 months...

I lost 10 Kilos and my blood also looks like i have a rare type of anemia? That's what they told me in the ER but my condition is not bad enough to be admitted (we have triage in germany).

After 2 MRIs, multiple X-rays, an ultrasound, 2 diagnostic injections (not a cortisone injection, but a 24-hour numbing injection to pinpoint problem area) and 6 doctors, they still aren’t sure what’s wrong. 

Nothing significant showed up on my latest MRI, other than what the doctor called “an irregularity.” He wasn’t sure if it was just inflammation, or possibly a very small cartilage tear in my joint. 

I have been sent to a rheumatologist to see if my pain is being caused by an autoimmune disorder since they can’t find anything on my scans (I have some hip pain, knee pain, etc) and I have had some blood markers come back as positive (positive ANA & ACA). I’m still following up with the rheumatologist, however, no one can determine yet if this is an isolated injury in my foot or being caused by an autoimmune disorder. 

The latest podiatrist that I saw, who I really liked, mentioned the chance of surgery since this hasn’t fully healed since October. However, I’m not even sure what he’d do surgery on since he can’t pinpoint what exactly is wrong. 

So, I’m wondering how dangerous it is to do surgery without knowing what’s wrong? What are the risks of them opening me up & finding nothing? How long would the healing process be if they don’t perform any operation, other than just opening up my foot? Is this even viable?

So for the past few weeks I (26F) have been having health issues which mainly consisted of petechiae all over my legs, shortness of breath with heart palpitations/racing, difficulty with eating due to nausea & bloating with some bowel/urinary issues that seem to flare up (most likely due to my recent bad eating habits) so I was sent for some blood tests yesterday, in which today my doctor texted me to get in touch. I was told that everything was somewhat normal, except my potassium levels were slightly elevated. I was told not to worry, and had blood tests rearranged for next week. 

I did what anyone naturally did and looked up what high potassium means & kind of gave myself some health anxiety, and I’m now paranoid since almost everything that I eat is high in potassium so I’m paranoid on eating those foods for the time being. I understand I’m probably overthinking things, but I can’t help but worry considering as mentioned, I have quite a few symptoms that add up, but whether these symptoms are just coincidence or not I guess time will tell.

Health background: Hashimotos, insulin resistance. Medication: Synthroid 50 mcg daily, metformin daily 

Drugs: never
Drinking: used to drink 3-4 times a week but have since reduced it to once a week 

I’ve been getting intermittent pain in my RUQ starting about 5 years ago (2018) Went to a GI then, did an abdominal ultrasound and they found a hemangioma told me it was small and not causing symptoms and that I had some trapped gas and eventually after maybe a month - the pain went away. 

2019 - same type of pain pops up (RUQ, feels like it’s my liver, but sometimes goes down the right side of my abdomen and almost my back). Since I had just gone to the doctor a year prior assumed it was trapped gas and it eventually went away. 

It basically came and went almost every year and almost every year it goes away. 

6 weeks ago however - the pain has come back. This time it feels worse? It hurts when I stretch it, hurts when I press on it. Radiates to kind of my right flank and just feels like something is gripping onto that areas. Sometimes the pain will be sharp and I’ve noticed it’s a lot worse after I do any type of core focused workout like wood chops or windmills or something. My lower back hurts a lot too. It feels like one long side stitch but it moves and sometimes it pulsates. I’m losing weight but I’ve just lost 12 lbs in a month and I think it’s because I’m trying. I don’t have any lethargy or anything in fact I’ve been able to maintain a 4-5 day a week workout schedule. 

I went to see the GI and he’s ordering an ultrasound but I’m so scared of what the results might hold. In my head everything is bad and there’s no way this hurts this bad and it’s not anything serious (I know this is anxiety - I’m seeing a professional). 

My question to any professionals is that, could this maybe be just muscular? Have patients come in with a lot of pain for it to be something benign? I’m just very scared, like I’m struggling to function at this point.

So I was hit on my brow bone this weekend. Little bit of a black eye (I don't bruise easily), followed by pressure headache the next day and fallowing day extremely drowsy with head pressure. 

I have in the past 3 years hit my head in this exact area 2 other times. The first time left a dent in my forehead. 

I feel pressure over my eye extending backward over my ear. Could I have a subdural hematoma? Should I get checked by my doctor? Or just let it self resolve. I am not elderly or sick.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15ab2dc/head_injury/,32.0,,

I’m a 29yo female. I have major generalized anxiety and depression that I do not take medications for. I had a right anterior tibial tubercle osteotomy and medial patellofemoral ligament repair 7/13. Currently taking Aspirin EC  81mg once daily, hydro/acetaminophen 10-325 every 4-6 hours for pain, and ondansetron 4mg prn for nausea.

15M and pretty much exactly what the title says. I can fall asleep fine, but I can’t stay asleep. I’ll wake up around 2-3 hours after initially falling asleep and then won’t go back to sleep until the morning, where I’ll only be able to sleep for a maximum of 3 more hours before I have to get up. I’ve looked in to the many causes of sleep issues, (eating/drinking too close to bedtime, blue light exposure too close to bed time, too hot/too cold, etc.) and have corrected as many as I could, however the problem just won’t go away. I take melatonin, and go to the gym almost daily. My doctor recommended taking Benadryl if melatonin didn’t do it for me, but I don’t wanna become dependent on sleeping pills or anything like that. The only hypothesis I have on what could still be causing this would possibly be stress overload and/or overthinking, which has been an issue for me since I was a little kid. This theory is kind of supported by my most recent vacation with family; we went camping and I had a lot of fun and was very happy during that time, and had no problem sleeping whatsoever. My sleep was better, but still a little rough (waking up 2-3 times a night for 15-30 minutes) after, until a few days ago, when my sister said something that kind of touched a sensitive spot, and I got really angry, so angry that I got a headache (the one I have when I’m stressed) and my chest felt all tight, and that night was when it all started again. I saw online that an herbal supplement, ashwagandha, reduces stress and relaxes you, which I think would help me be able to sleep, so I bought some, but haven’t taken it yet because I heard it causes hormonal issues and hasn’t really been studied in teens. I know it’s important not to interfere with hormones as a teenager, but it’s also important to sleep well as a teenager, so I’m stuck. I really need to get this sorted out before school starts, otherwise my life will be a living hell.

4M Caucasian/black 17kg, history of adenoidectomy, ? Iron deficient anemia, recently told he has sickle cell trait, OSA (currently followed by ENT for potential tonsillectomy)

After a fever lasting eight days, I took my son into the Children’s Hospital, where they performed a bunch of bloodwork and swabs, and found out he was strep positive. They also informed me that his hemoglobin was low (99) and iron levels are extremely low (2). I began him on iron supplementation and did follow up bloodwork (which I will post) a month and a half later. We found out that he has sickle cell trait (so does his father) and that has iron went from 2 to 6 (so still lower than the lower limit). 

 My doctor is referring us to a hematologist to follow up further, but in the meantime, I am wondering if the iron deficiency anaemia can have anything to do with sickle cell trait?

I, 21F (330lbs, 5'11""), always been prone to ear and sinus infections, but it's gotten worse since I got my tonsils and adenoids removed (in 2013ish). Recently it's been really bad. Just over a month ago I had a ear infection, sinus infection, bronchitis, and double pink eye. I could hardly blow anything out of my nose and I tried a Neti Pot, which didn't help. I eventually blew out a massive booger that was dry, crusty, chunky, sticky, red, green, and brown! I almost threw up because i felt it release from the back of my throat.I tried humid and dry environments and nothing helped. My Doc put me on antibiotics and that seemed ti help. 

Currently I have the same issue minus the pink eye. I blew out the same booger but it wasnt red at all, just brown and green. My eats are plugged and it's hard to blow my nose. It's also causing sore throat and this weird, dry, mostly unproductive cough. I've tried sudafed and dayquil/nyquil and it doesn't do much for me.

I don't smoke, vape, or do any drugs. I do have asthma and i had tubes in my ears when I was younger, but I've since had them removed. I have experience second hand smoke as a lot of my family smokes around me.

15ac9pj,"Question about HPV vaccine
Where I live (Netherlands) teenagers get offered a vaccine against sexually transmitted HPV, but many don't end up getting it (often because of their parents, which is also the case for me). This year they've made it free to get it as an adult if you were born after 1995, so I've been thinking about getting it. I'm 23 and married. 

I know that it's still worth getting if you've already had sex and if you only have one sexual partner, etc. My question is: is it worth getting if you have only had one partner, if they've only had one partner too and if you're planning to stay monogamous for the rest of your life? Of course you can never know 100% certain whether it works out that way, but for now I'm just going to assume that it does.

I've tried to look it up and also asked a few people about it, but didn't really get a clear answer. If getting the vaccine can still actually protect me against something I'm happy to go get it, if there's a 99% certainty that it won't matter I don't really see the point. The same is true for my partner. 

I don't know if this is a stupid question but no one I've asked seems to really know for sure.

TL;DR I [14M] who does lots of public speaking and debating faints while debating even though I wasn’t nervous and without any history of anything like this before. 

So first a bit of backstory I [14M] do lots of debating and public speaking comps inside and outside of school. I am never overly nervous just a little bit - a healthy amount I guess. I never have butterflies in the stomach or get shaky or get sweaty.

Last night was the 2nd round in the finals draw for our debating competition and I was feeling good but when I got up to speak everything fell apart. As third speaker I do mostly rebuttals in my speech and my rebuttals are not very prepared and I speak mostly off the cuff. When I started my rebuttals I noticed that my brain was thinking of what I should be saying but my mouth didn’t want to say those words. Normally when I’ll third speaking I do this perfectly fine but for some reason my “mouth didn’t want to mouth” as my friend said. In other words I could speak just I was speaking not what my brain was telling me to speak.

On the next palm card I could feel the blood rushing from by face but I pushed through (very stupid in retrospect I know). Next palm card I could feel my hands getting clammy and started sweating profusely so I took of my jumper and blazer (I don’t know why I was sweating it was a cold night and the room was quite cold as well). I also started to notice a slight ringing in my ears. I also started to feel dizzy.
Then on my fourth palm card everything went blurry and sounded muffed and I collapsed. Didn’t hit my head on the way down according to our coach and was out for only a couple seconds. 

When I woke up everything was blurry I could only make out people by their voices which sounded muffed and distance like I was wearing noice canceling headphone while they were trying to speak to me from the other side of an oval. It took about 10-15 minutes to recover and even after then I still wasn’t fully better. 

Fast forward to this morning I am feeling better but I have got a mild headache (not sure if it relates to the fainting but I didn’t have it as far as I am aware before the debate). I have had not history of fainting for any reason. I did feel slightly nauseous on the way to the venue that went away once I arrived. I am not feeling stressed at school, quite the opposite actually - I am bored. I have taken on a few more extracurriculars in the last couple weeks but haven’t been stressed about them.

This month I saw some weird fleshy-jelly like consistency on pad that’s mostly brown like coffee grains and has a few pink-red fleshy consistency 

It’s been painful, with back cramping which isn’t typical for me either.

I visited the doctor 3 weeks ago bc I thought I got candida bc I had been having a thrush on my gland and my gf had had it. He recommended me an antifungal cream (Imazol cream) and I applied it for two weeks. I thought it was getting better but after the treatment the lips of my urethra began to get irritated and a small white wound started showing. It hurts when I pee and also the gland is very irritated with white little wounds opening. I think it is slowly getting better but I don't really know what it is. Maybe this has nothing to do with candida and it s caused bc a little injury or friction that I didnt notice. But what could it be?

15acj76,"Electroconvulsive Therapy Treatment
I have severe, treatment-resistant depression. Tomorrow, I have an appointment set up to decide what treatment to go forward with. I'm leaning towards ECT, but my parents are concerned that I will have long-term memory loss or that I could end up in a group home for the rest of my life if one of the shocks that I'm given will shock me too much. I've talked to multiple doctors and I've done my own research and while getting long-term memory loss is a possibility in rare cases, nowhere have I been told that I could end up in a group home.

My other options are ketamine (which can be given through an IV or nasal spray), or TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation). 

My concern for ketamine is that it's a new treatment for depression where the long-term side-effects are unknown and even if I do the treatment now, it's likely I will have to get treatment again later in life. 

I don't have too much concern for ECT other than the side-effects but I suppose those side-effects are not that much worse than the side-effects I already have from my medicine.

Other info: 
- My insurance covers all of these treatments but I will have to pay for the treatments co-pay by myself. 
- One set of treatments usually lasts 2-4 months, 2-5 times a week, but this varies depending on the person and the type of treatment.
- I will have to take a bus to these treatments.

15acbfk,"My muscle injuries won't heal even after 5 years of rest
So when i was 18 i used to do both calisthenics and weight lifting, i wasn't really careful with warming up or taking precautions. as days go by, i started noticing a little stiffness point in my upper chest and i could feel that the spot is so small (i mean just a dot in the middle where the muscle attaches to the bone i think it's the tendon, not the entire muscle) and this feeling like i have a knot blocking the movement kept going everytime i do dips or chest with cables but it wasn't that painful so i ignored it and kept training hoping it would go away but it didn't.  


Until one day i was rowing (back training) until that knot snaps and my upper chest hurts like hell everytime i use that muscle.  
So after this accident i was told i should fully recover after 15 days, so i quit training but it didn't even after 5 years of rest that spot still hurts everytime i try to do simple push ups or any chest exercise.  


I have seen many doctors and done many rehabilitation techniques and exercises but nothing seems to work, even the doctors couldn't give a diagnosis because the ultrasound showed no anomaly in that spot.

I want to know if anyone have faced this case before and solved the problem because i have quit every sort of training because of these injuries ( I have other identical injuries in my back, leg and shoulder with the same type of feeling i only described the one in the chest so that the post won't be too long)  


I would really appreciate someone giving me the slightest of light of information about this, idk if the doctors in my country (algeria) are stupid, or these are chronic tendon injuries that will never heal, or my body is just weird. the thing that bugs me is when i see these famous athletes have way more severe injuries than mine but they recover perfectly, and im out here with nothing after 5 years.

15awg37,"My menstrual cycle has become very erratic but tests showed no underlying conditions. Is it worth getting a second opinion?
Hi, Docs! Thanks for any advice you can give me:  
**Basic stats:** Female, 35, 171cm, 80 kilos.  
**Pre-existing conditions:** ADHD, mild infectious asthma, history of PPD/A  
**Medications:** Concerta (54mg) and ritalin (20mg)  
**Location:** Malta, Europe

I went to my regular gynecologist for testing because my periods have started behaving quite erratically since the start of this year. As of last week, I've had my period 11 times since the start of the year, usually with one longer cycle (24-26 days) followed by one really short cycle (10-15 days). My cycles have always been on the short side (21-24 days was my normal average), but otherwise regular.

It had happened previously that during periods of high stress my period might arrive early for one cycle, but it's never kept going for this long. I was quite stressed at the beginning of the year, but life has calmed down a lot now, though it seems no one has told my ovaries that. Additional complaints are really heavy mood swings and acne along my jaw. I have had some insomnia and brain fog, but with the ADHD, those have been pretty standard for my whole life, though my medication has seemed less effective lately.

I recieved the following tests: ultrasound, smear test, FSH-LH-Prolactin-Testosterone blood test, Thyroid function blood test. All were clear. I had an insurance physical recently where I also got a clean bill of health for my blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting glucose, etc. I'm working on my weight.

My doctor told me she'd like to wait for a couple of months to see if it clears up with a bit of diet and exercise, and if nothing changes then to look at hormonal solutions. I have historically been pretty bad at taking the pill, but the last time I was taking it was before I started being treated for ADHD, so maybe I'll be better now. Also, my worry isn't just making my cycle better but fixing whatever is causing it to fluctuate (if possible).

I guess I'm just annoyed that there seems to be no medical reason for this sudden change. Don't get me wrong, I'm very happy there isn't any long term issue to worry about, but it's frustrating that there doesn't seem to be any answer for why this is happening. So, is it worth seeking a second opinion just to be sure?  


**Tl;dr:** 11 periods in 7 months, slightly overweight and stressed, but otherwise apparently healthy. Does this just happen with no explanation or should I get a second opinion?

15aygqn,"Hep B vaccine extended allergic reaction
About 1 day after getting a Hep B vaccine (part one of two) I (28F) developed a case of full body hives that waxes and wanes but never goes away on its own. 

It’s been five weeks since the vaccine. They are itchy and blotchy and happen most painfully on my thighs, calves, and arms but also appear on my hands (palms and backs) and feet. One day my eyelids swelled shut and they were all over my face). They are itchy and ache very badly). Also my hands are so swollen in the morning I stopped wearing rings.

I am fully vaccinated for every possible thing (Covid, yearly flu shots, mumps, multiple tetanus, 3-part hep B as a child, HPV, etc) and never ever ever had a skin reaction. I’ve never even had a reaction like this to the one thing I am allergic to (dog dander).

A Zyrtec will reduce the itchy ness for 36-48 hours but the blotches and swelling are still visible.

I won’t have access to a PCP until two weeks from now and the employee health service just told me “oh that’s weird, don’t get the second dose” and gave me the impression they don’t think it’s the vaccine and don’t really care. 

Is this all in my head? Have I spontaneously developed an autoimmune disease? 

What things should I tell the PCP so that they take me seriously? (History of doctors dismissing things that are chronic and not easily diagnosable). 

They are so itchy painful and swollen once the Zyrtec wears off sometimes I sit in my work bathroom and cry until the next dose kicks in

37F, white, 5'9, 180 (muscular). ASD level 1/OCD/Surgical intervention for bad spine. (Let me know if you need more). Med: Luvox, gabapentin (both long term, but my second scenario predates both), new: statin for genetic high cholesterol.  (EDITED TO ADD) I used to suffer migraines, and now seem to occasionally be getting the migraines that don't obviously hurt, but make one nauseated and super sensitive to light. The gabapentin helped with a lot of my original migraine issues, as it helps my neck to relax.

An issue I have had for years has come back to my attention.

I drove cross country (USA) last few days, and even after a decent night's sleep, caffeine (which I usually don't imbibe), AC blasting, MUSIC blasting, window open....about an hour after I start driving, I start falling asleep. And by falling, I mean like I literally cant control my eyes  from going crossed.  Of course this is INCREDIBLY dangerous.

Yes, I know the immediate is ""you are just sleepy"", but this seems.....extreme, and happens after decent sleep and only within the first two hours of driving, even for a ten hour drive. AND, there is another piece. This also used to happen to me at work. First thing in the morning. There was a very formal meeting where I was required to sit at my desk to monitor messages, but a very large crowd would be gathered in the room with me, often directly around my desk. It became a running joke that I would suddenly start falling asleep the instant folks surrounded me. I tried all the same strategies. Got a new cup of coffee, tried cold liquids, tried pinching myself, etc. Yet my head almost hit my keyboard. This was not boring meeting.

Its almost instantaneous, and right when the people dispersed from around my desk, I was fully back to awake. Same with the driving. Right when I get to a rest stop and get out of my car, instantly fully awake.

I was diagnosed with ""Catatonia"" when I received my OCD dx (and the suggestion of ASD, which I rejected at the time as I had a poor understanding of what that could present as in women).  That was about 8 years ago, and during a time of severe stress. It was managed with a couple doses of lorazepam during following occurrences. All contained 8 years ago.

The official ASD dx was in 2022 by a specialist and three psychs.

Is this....incredibly sudden onset sleepiness related to the ASD or something? I am not stressed out, very far from it, so I feel its unrelated to the catatonia responses I had years ago when I was under enormous stress.  It almost feels like its some type of claustrophobia response. Being in a car. Being surrounded by people in a formal setting, etc.

I am an extremely light sleeper, but tend to supplement with naps. This doesn't feel like just falling asleep, it feels like almost being put to sleep.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated, as I love road trips and driving in general. I am looking to find a way to prevent this.

I took furagin to stop the pain again for a couple weeks but I went to the doctor again (because it didn't help). The doctor prescribed me with antibiotics, it also didn't help. I thought maybe this means that the issue is not cystitis and maybe doesn't have anything to do with my urinary system at all so I went to a gynecologist, turned out I had vaginitis (I don't know why, I'm a virgin) and they treated that with thichopol tablets (2 tablets per day for a week) and with polygynax (6 capsules, 1 per day), it helped but then I had urethral pain and to this day no doctor could tell me what it was.

Hello, hopefully someone can help me. So I (32F) stubbed my second toe really hard in early December 2022. The toe turned black and blue and was swollen at the time. I was told it was likely a bruised bone and to do the RICE method and give it time. I did not get an x-ray or anything else. Because I have chronic illness (mystery gut pain, fibromyalgia, vertigo, brain fog, Raynaud’s), I was told it was normal it was taking longer than usual for the pain to go away, that the Raynaud’s itself was delaying the healing, but that things would clear in time. 

It’s been seven months now and the toe slowly got better over time, even though it gets slightly swollen and bright red from time to time (happens when the Raynaud’s flares up and looks more red or darker than the rest of the foot when it does). The pain had gone away and it was just the color that was still about a shade darker than the rest of my foot. But now really hot where I live, and the toe started hurting really bad again in the heatwave, even making it hard to be on my feet. 

I was told that by this point, my options would be either to leave it and deal with the pain, or to get surgery, which I want to avoid at all costs.

I’m asking for opinions here because the amount of times I’ve seen doctors, had multiple tests done that came to nothing, had my concerns dismissed and still had to deal with my health problems because I couldn’t get medical help is beyond belief, so I don’t want to put myself through that again if I can help it.

On Tuesday she called me to say one of the numbers relating to my liver came back high, my ALT was at 61 (had bloods done just before becoming pregnant and this number was at 16). She asked when my next hospital appointment was which was the following day for my anomaly scan and she told me she wanted me to bring in a copy of the blood results to discuss with them, which I did.

In the mean time I had a look online (not advised I know) but I came across more than one source stating this number can be an indication of cholestasis and should typically decrease in pregnancy and be below a result of 33. The figure of 33 as an upper limit was also quoted on a source I found from the hospital I'm attending. As far as I know no tests for bile acids have been done.

When I raised this is the hospital they didn't seem that concerned, they did more blood work where my ALT had dropped down to 46, which is better but still above the 33 I've seen quoted. They made it seem like unless i was experiencing itching that these numbers didn't really matter? Does everyone with cholestasis always experience the extremely itchy palms of their hands and soles of their feet? 

I feel a bit dismissed but my only option would be to go back and hope to see someone else and possibly a better explanation but theres no guarantee! Can a person be diagnosed with cholestasis without experiencing the itchiness? Or should numbers close to mine be treated as something to be concerned about? 

I'm not trying to seem like a drama queen and I don't want to waste any of the hospital staffs time, but obviously cholestasis can have devastating results so I'm just finding it hard to feel completely at ease with how things went in the hospital yesterday.

If you've read all of this I really appreciate it! And if you've any experience with/knowledge of cholestasis or blood results similar to mine it would be amazing if you could leave a comment for me.

15b6rdc,"F27 Increased / excessive gag reflex
Hi! Thank you in advance for reading this. I’ve noticed in the last several months that I’ve had a sudden (significant) increase in my gag reflex. Examples are gagging while brushing my teeth (nothing that’s even remotely by the back of my mouth/throat), the smell of food from doing dishes, certain tastes or textures while eating, and even just the other day the smell of my dog’s accident (when it happened in the house, not ever outside). I’m not joking when I say it’s excessive, it sometimes has turned into multiple uncontrollable gags / almost into heaving. Is there anything that might be triggering this, more serious that I should be aware of? It’s starting to bother me and it’s making me anxious to go to the dentist soon (which I’ve never felt before) because I recognize it will likely happen there with how sensitive I am to literally anything recently. I’ve wondered if it might be mental but why did this come out of seemingly nowhere? I’m not on any new medication and I have no risk of being pregnant.

Hi,  
I have been experiencing paresthesia (pins and needles) for about a week. I feel pricks all over my body but mostly in my hands and feet. I scheduled an appointment with my primary care doctor, and he ran a whole slew of blood tests. All came back normal. He referred me to a neurologist. I saw a neurologist last year due migraines (with aura). They did an MRI without contrast and found a very small gliosis on my brain. My understanding is that this is a white matter lesion. The neurologist said this was normal for those who suffer from migraines with aura. She assured me that I would be fine. I started taking magnesium threonate and almost a year and a half later, I haven’t had another migraine with aura. I don’t really have any other neurological symptoms that I am aware of. Sometimes I struggle to find words, but I may have always been like that. No vertigo, nausea, fatigue, weakness, numbness, etc. I am extremely active and pretty healthy. I partake in weight lifting, climbing and running. I eat very healthy and my vitals are all very good.

&#x200B;

  
The reason I am posting here for advice is because of how little information is out there, and almost all the causes of paresthesia seem to be very serious. This has me worried sick. I hate playing the waiting game. I have no idea if I am actively suffering damage to my brain or nerves. I am wondering if there is anyone out there who has been down this path before.

I know your immunity can drop a little due to hormonal changes at different points of the menstrual cycle but this is just insane? I feel like it’s really abnormal how often I am ill. It has been affecting my quality of life so much as I have little energy to do stuff, my coughing keeps me up at night, I spend more than what I can afford on medicine etc…

I went to a physical doctor about this and she was completely useless to put it kindly. She was insisting that I have hay fever despite me saying that I have these symptoms all year round and I don’t feel any worse when around plants. She was just not willing to listen and prescribed me a bunch of hay fever meds. I thought, hell, she might be right, I should trust a doctor and just get these medications. I ended up spending so much money on these medications and getting so much worse despite using them exactly as instructed. 

My colds persisted- I have about 3 healthy weeks (at best) before I get sick again. It’s ruining my life and I have no idea what to do hence why I have turned to reddit of all places.

I suspect I may have fibromyalgia, my mom has it and I have a lot of the symptoms she has, I've had a traumatic injury to trigger it, but never had it diagnosed. 

Around age 23 I started developing pain in my right wrist and hand from repetitive stress, I used to be a barista, I did macrame for a few years and I've since always had an office job and study computer programming and draw a lot in my free time. So I spend a lot of time using my hands and all of my hobbies surround it, I know that's why I have either carpal or radial tunnel syndrome (pain shoots up the pinky side of my hand and goes to my elbow sometimes) and I'm going to the doctor for it tomorrow. By 25 I had to take breaks regularly from doing anything for weeks at a time sometimes because I'd be in such constant pain, and now I can't even consistently write without being in pain within a few minutes. Nothing OTC touches it and I don't really want medication pain management bc my parents are both addicts. 

Primary concern since about age 24 has been a large swollen tendon sheath or muscle on the side of my right wrist below my thumb. I don't have pictures but it easily pushed out like half an inch during really bad flare ups. Ice and heat helped a little but it was pretty constant even if there wasn't any pain. I also started stretching it but I'm not  very consistent with it. My left wrist to this day still feels smooth, but my right wrist has a little bump there still. 

I started testosterone about a year ago and in the last year the swelling has gone down almost entirely just leaving a little bump you can't see but you can feel. I have been working out more in the last month or so trying to ease the pain by giving my wrists more support from the rest of my muscles but the swelling of that tendon has been gone well before that.

So what could have happened? Was it the testosterone, because I know that can thicken my ligaments and strengthen my joints a little? Or the increase of muscle mass/50lbs or so I have lost from it? Or was it just bc I have ignored it for so long that it healed on it's own? 

  
Thank you for your time, I am going to the dr for it tomorrow with the hopes of getting a cortisone shot to ease the pain since i've had great luck with it in my ankle and it helped me heal a herniated disc in my spine.

Meds:
- Adderall XR 30 mg 1x/day

- Spironolactone 100mg

In short — I have a lengthy history of gastrointestinal distress and abdominal pain. Originally told to just lose weight, try removing IUD to see if that made a difference (9/2019). Continued to have abdominal (mostly right upper quadrant) pain. 


 From 3/2020 - 8/2020 I lost about 40 pounds without trying. Felt full really quickly, frequent nausea. I wasn’t complaining though, definitely needed to lose some weight. 

After losing the weight and still having pain, primary doc recommended ultrasound and additional testing. Turns out my gallbladder was trash, was scheduled for cholecystectomy two weeks later (9/2020). 

Post gallbladder removal was a process in and of itself, took quite a long time to feel somewhat “normal” again. 

Probably about 6 months post op (spring 2021), I woke up one morning with a new pain in my abdomen. At first it felt like extreme hunger pains, but it quickly intensified and I was on the verge of calling an ambulance. At best I can describe it as extreme cramping/burning that was centralized in my abdomen and radiated to my sternum. The whole episode lasted about 30 minutes.

I had about 3 more of these episodes over the following months. Most other mornings I still had the abdominal pain but it didn’t escalate into these full blown episodes.  I got into a GI specialist and was scheduled for a colonoscopy and endoscopy in spring 2022. Nothing remarkable found during those. 

Frustrated and feeling like I’m just going to continue having this pain. I did have a laparoscopy to r/o endometriosis 2/2023, and had a pedunculate uterine fibroid removed during procedure. Not sure if it’s relevant but I also had a colposcopy in Jan 2022 due to high grade dysplasia, and then a second colposcopy and endometrial biopsy Sep 2022. Last pap Jan 2023 was clear. 

Lately I’ve been having more right upper quadrant pain, sometimes more centralized above my navel. Pain is worse in the mornings but has been intermittent throughout the day.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15b46h7/recurring_abdominal_pain_in_mornings/,30.0,Female,Self

I found out that an anal douche can help with cleaning the area, so I have been using that and it seems to work for cleanliness-sake but it obviously doesn't fix the underlying issue of the stools.

Also since surgery, after I clean my butt (with or without the douche), I find that more seems to leak out later on. I will get a feeling that there is something wet between my cheeks or in my pants and I will go the bathroom and wipe and sure enough there is more of the never-ending mustard-colored poop. It's practically anal incontinence. I am at a complete loss and this is beyond frustrating.

I talked with my doctor who performed the surgery numerous times and he says it will get better with time, as fistulas can take up to 2 or so months to heal (and mine was pretty bad from what I hear). But would that affect bowel movements? He also recommended taking soluble fiber supplements like Benefiber and Metamucil, which I have been taking now for over a month daily. 

So far my workaround for the leaking bowels is to shove gauze up there to help soak it up so my clothes don't get ruined or stained. I can't keep being dependent on gauze or douching for this.

Has this happened to anyone else? What is the treatment for this?",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15b0646/leaky_bowels_after_fistula_surgery/,30.0,Male,Self

27 Male 

Hey guys. My cat did a number on me the other night by accident. PCP refuses to see me and said all cat scratches need to go straight to ER and they won’t look at them there, but everything I’m seeing online says to watch it for symptoms of CSD. Was hoping to just get clarification on if I am able to watch this injury for complications or if I need to see a doctor asap. 

Info about my injury: bite and deep scratch in the middle of the pinky side of my forearm from around 1 AM EST 7/25 from indoor cat that had escaped our home for 45 minutes. Washed immediately, used hydrogen peroxide, covered with Neosporin and bandage overnight. Still washing and using Neosporin to treat and ibuprofen for the swelling and pain. Our cat is up to date on all vaccinations. 

Unfortunately, there is a decent amount of swelling and it is pretty red in the surrounding skin. Tendon in forearm feels painful and tight, can’t really bend my wrist backwards but other movements are perfectly fine. The injury hurts but the worst pain is down closer to my wrist in the center (really painful) and in my upper right tricep strangely, though the tricep pain just started last night. Area around wound is warm but no fever, no loss of appetite, no fatigue, etc. Swelling looks better than yesterday but redness around skin looks like it is spreading. Still leaking small amounts of blood and clear liquid. Looked like a little pus this morning, but it washed away in the shower and has not come back. 

I have included pictures of the original injury as well as what it looks like yesterday and today. I appreciate your help!

15b1bg8,"Excessive underarm sweating
Hi, im 32M, 6ft, 80kg fit and healthy. For as long as i can remember ive suffered with excessive sweating of the underarms. Within a matter of hours i sweat through my tops and i have to constantly keep going to the toilet to dry of stains. This happens in both summer and winter. I shower every day and use deodorant every time I change my top, the sweat does not have a foul odor but is just excessive. Ive also tried using the Aluminium Chloride anti antiperspirants but they started to cause cysts in my underarms so I stopped. The issue only exists in my underarms, i do not sweat through my clothes in any other part of my body. Im no on any medication and dont have any existing medical conditions. Not sure what to do as you can imagine its an extremely frustrating issue to deal with, especially at work.

15b9grn,"Strep throat making allergies go CRAZY
17m

I recently got strep, and at first I thought it was COVID or the flu because of my allergies were going nuts. Right now, I'm on 2 claratin, 2 benadryl, and flonase, but my nose is running a lot and I've been getting a cough. I got congestion in my right ear that makes it harder to hear, I'm sneezing constantly... You get the idea.

I get really bad allergies, but the copious amounts of antihistamines I take help a lot. I haven't had a reaction this bad from seasonal allergies since I started regularly taking antihistamines. And worse yet, even doubling the claratin and flonase didn't help...

I would think it was a coincidence if the allergies didn't start at the exact same time as the strep symptoms. I know it's just strep since I got tested for strep, COVID, and the flu, and strep is the only one that came back positive, so this is just... Weird.

This isn't a big issue or anything, at the end of the day it's just allergies, I'm just really confused 😅",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15b9grn/strep_throat_making_allergies_go_crazy/,17.0,Male,Self

Male 20 A few days ago, my penis had a rather sensitive pigmented spot on its head. It didn't have a lesion or any form of skin being broken, however as days went by, the lesion started forming. I just want a better understand of what this or could be. I haven't experienced something like this before.
