15aalqm,"Shoulder blade tingling?
Male, 23, UK, weight roughly 210/220 pounds, Height 5ft 10/11, I drink some weekends and i'm starting to limit smoking weed to the weekends aswell.

Hey!

So in my post history, I made a post on a panic attack subreddit about my first time with a weed induced panic attack, which made me go to the hospital. 

Ever since then though, I have been getting tingling in my shoulder blade/back, I had a mini panic attack yesterday and ive noticed its kind of came back. It happens randomly throughout the day and it'll last for anywhere between 5 to 20 minutes.

Probably quite obvious, but is this just something that could be related to anxiety? It just seems like a weird symptom to get",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15aalqm/shoulder_blade_tingling/,23.0,,

Male, 25, 180cm, 85kg.


Hello everyone. 
Short story - About 3 hours ago my food poisoning  symptoms kicked in. I’ve had some burgers and apparently they were old or something. Now I’ve got a diarrhea, I’m vomiting, I’m extremely cold even though it’s 30C outside and my body temperature is 37,9 C.
About a week ago I’ve starting taking anxiety reducing medication that my doctor prescribed me. (Eglonyl around 150mg and mirthazipone 15mg ).
My main symptom was heart palpitations, every kind of it. Sometimes it feels like I’m sinking for a second when my heart skips the beat, or it gives me an additional beat, or I’m feeling the heart rate very loud and clear in my throat and sometimes entire body. I don’t really feel dizziness, only feeling of being sinked down. I’ve run some tests and doctors said that my heart was fine except I’ve got 1st degree of mirtal heart prolapse, which they said isn’t a disease or anything but an anomaly. When heart palpitations happening I feel like I’m going to die for a few seconds, then everything becomes fine.
So right now, when I’m vomiting, my body is getting very tensed. And I feel those palpitations once or twice, they become more ugly and I’m starting ti fear more. Should I be worried?

15a5z4y,"23, low libido and worse erections, test of 375. next steps...
Hi -  
  
  
Had decaying libido for the past year so got a test for total T on the NHS, came back at 375 to which my GP said was fine and to basically go away, I think it's stopped decaying now to the point where I can have sex around 4 times a week not counting when I try and force it. not going to go on TRT as I'm still young and would rather try natural stuff first. Also don't get morning wood and random erections anymore, erection quality is generally poorer. In fact it's pretty difficult to get erections at all (just watched a video of me fucking my gf and nothing really happened, however this could just be psychological because I'm thinking about it in relation to this a lot). No other low T symptoms, have a great gf and everything is good on relationship front (apart from low sex drive). After a couple of months of trying this plan I will pay for a full test.  
  
6""1 and 12.5 stone, have put on about 10lbs over the past year. I'm fairly naturally built and don't have a massive amount of bodyfat, not as if I'm a 6""1 twig with all my weight hanging off as fat.  
  
Quit weed just over a month ago after smoking around 0.25g a day for the past year, made absolutely no difference to any part of my life, although I was definitely addicted and had cravings.  
  
Haven't drank in a few days after getting this test, intending to cut down to 1 or 2 days a week of medium drinking (3-4 pints). Was drinking this almost daily before.  
  
Have ordered Zinc, Magnesium, D3+K2, and Boron - not expecting to be a magic pill but might help.  
  
I'm not interested in lifting so will start doing cardio, chopping wood etc.  
  
Sleep was also a big thing, I think I've probably been on 6-7 hours 5 days a week for the last year, going to try and up this to 8 hours every day instead of just weekends.  
  


does this plan look good for the moment?

15acorj,"Extreme bloating and unbearable stomach pain- please help


Hi. 22F, currently only take migraine medicine on as as needed basis. 
Monday morning, I woke up with severe stomach pain. I went and had a bowel movement, nothing seemed abnormal. However, the pain didn’t go away, if anything it got worse. This was followed by nausea and vomiting. The entire day I felt unwell and slept. Woke up tuesday morning, felt better no nausea however stomach pain was back. When i went to shower i notice my abdominal area was extremely swollen. I decided to take a trip to urgent care. The doctor told me it was most likely acid related, and to take 2 pepcids a day for a week. They did a urine test however, and found microscopic traces of blood( meaning, on the test the result showed up as large amounts but you could not see it in the urine with the naked eye). He said this is most likely menstrual related, but i’m not due for another week or so. I’ve taken the pepcid, however the swelling has gotten worse. I noticed it seems to flare up after I’ve eaten something (i’ve only been consuming toast bananas applesauce and soup). Currently it’s the worst it’s been and hard to the touch. It feels like i constantly need to go to the bathroom, however i can’t pass stool (can still pass gas though with difficulty )I thought it might be a bad bout of constipation and took some sennosides, and I did have a bowel movement. The pain and swelling is still very much there. The pain is extreme and cramp like, and happens anywhere from my upper abdomen down to my belly button. My biggest concern is a bowel obstruction. I’m not sure whether or not I should go back to urgent care or wait for a gastroenterologist appointment (ideally i’d avoid it because i’m s student and hospital bills are expensive, but health is a priority of course)",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15acorj/extreme_bloating_and_unbearable_stomach_pain/,22.0,,

15aez9o,"Irrational insomnia fear [20M]
Hi all! 

Two and a half years ago, I had a sleepless night and couldn’t sleep well the night after that, so had to take medication to help me fall asleep. In the months after that I didn’t function very well because I had unknowingly developed a fear of not being able to sleep, and dying because of that. 

I know it’s completely irrational, and I’m still seeing a therapist and take some meds to keep my anxiety in check. And it’s pretty much under control, and I sleep well. However, occasionally I do still have moments in which the anxiety resurfaces, and have emergency medication if I really need to take it. 

But my question to you is… because it’s never a bad idea to look for further confirmation. Is there a chance, or how big is the chance that I could die of not being able to sleep? 

Your answer might help me find some calm when I’m tossing and turning and can’t find any sleep… and worry about not being able to sleep.

I’m a 28 yo female, 220lbs. I get the recommended 150 minutes of cardio a week and eat a vegan low salt diet (husband is older and has hypertension I’ve not been recommended a low salt diet). Last weekend I was running errands and felt light headed, nauseous and having heart palpitations and generally felt like death warmed over. Did a full set of vitals when I got home and checked my blood sugar (not diabetic just a nurse and didn’t see the need to go to the ED before ruling out what I could at home). Everything was WNL except my BP that was 160/120. Took my PRN Xanax incase it was just anxiety and rechecked after thirty minutes when it went up to 180/130 Went to the ED and they did a EKG which was normal except for tachycardia which has been my baseline since childhood (I run 80-90 but was a bit anxious in the ED so it was 105). They ran an electrolyte panel and troponin levels which where all normal. Sent me home with a diagnosis of anxiety because they could see in my chart that I have a GAD diagnosis. I’ve monitored my BP over the last week and it’s been around 170/120 except one night where it was 200/140 (checked twice with my electric cuff and then made my husband take a manual pressure all with the same results). I have an apt with my primary next week but I want to be prepared to advocate for myself before then because at my last physical she put in my chart that I don’t exercise (without even asking me if I did which I do) and that my diet “needs improvement” because I told her I am early in eating disorder recovery so all diet advice needs to be filtered through my ED coach (who she did not reach out to). I’m afraid she’s also just going to fob it off as anxiety or a diet/exercise problem like the ED did. Would I be within my rights as a patient to request Methyldopa?

15a9mal,"What might my partner have and what can I do to help?
30F AMAB, Height: 166cm Weight 73kg
Medications: Methylphenidate (2022-present)

Hi there, my partner and I are from the North East of England, UK. I'm posting on behalf of my partner with her permission.

In early 2021, my partner had sprained her arm trying to clean around the house, and it was taking a while to heal. She became frustrated and impatient and tried to do some stretches to elieviate the pain. In doing so, she twisted and pulled her back in some way.

What that led to is the past couple of painful years, with very consistent symptoms happening every day.

- She has pain on her left side, not her chest but not her back either. It's worsened with anxiety, and it feels like a constant pressure, tightening feeling. 
- This is accompanied by her left foot tingling, especially when putting pressure on the nearest affected area, either on her back or on her chest.
- Her body temperature can change drastically, and when she has a 'movement' of something around her injury, she can break out in a sweat suddenly. 
- The severity of her pain can impair her breathing a little.
- As it is constant this also causes her to feel tired a lot. 

So far she has done tons of stretching exercises consistently every day, taken NSAIDs (Ibuprofen mostly, she has been prescribed naproxen but she can't take it as it contains excipient she is intolerant to--yippee.), been to see a chiropractor multiple times, has self referred to MSK to try and get help, and has requested help from NHS 111 multiple times. She has had plenty of rest, has done various kinds of cardio exercise (Walks, rock climbing at my gym) , and we have continuously checked and adjusted her posture. I've provided massages to the best of my ability also. Her symptoms remain consistent, with good days and bad days.

When I've searched up the symptoms they always seem to line up either with costochondritis, or radiculopathy (pinched nerve), but we have had no formal diagnosis. Honestly, getting any kind of scan or assessment beyond a general check has been impossible. We have ruled out heart, lungs and such, as she has had an £CG and her lungs checked.

r/ChronicPain have also suggested potentials, static nerve problems, scoliosis, hEDS or a herniated disc (Which would line up with Radiculopathy) 

The part that has me absolutely stumped is the foot tingling response. That would indicate nerve, but from my, admittedly novice, reading on the matter, the nerves for the legs and feet travel down from the lower spine, but this is upper back/chest pain, so a link doesn't seem to exist there, but I may be wrong. We have another telephone appointment with our local MSK in August, and I'm going to try and get her approved for scans with a view towards some kind of diagnosis.

I wanted to ask here. With these kinds of symptoms, and given all she is doing to try and find relief, what can she do? Is there something I've overlooked in my research? Has anyone experienced anything similar, and found a way to mitigate or even prevent the pain?

Again, we're in the UK, so access to various services can be... different, in our 'NHS way'. Any and all advice is super appreciated, and if I need to clarify anything I'll respond to any questions or anything as best as I can.

I just want some signposts, if anything, to try and convince our doctors and practitioners in our area to do more than tell her to keep doing the same stretches she's been doing for over two years now.

I just want to do something to help, because as hard as we try the doctors haven't done a thing to help her.

46 year old male, 5’11” approx 200 lbs. 

Non-smoker, no recreational drugs.  Unfortunately he is a heavy/binge drinker. He’ll drink until he passes out (or is close to it) 3-4 nights in a row, abstain from drinking for 3-4 days and then repeat the cycle.  This has been going on for 10+ years.  He often tries to quit drinking but has never been successful for more than a few weeks. He has never sought professional help for his drinking. 

He has medication resistant high blood pressure, currently controlled by two prescriptions and a water pill. He takes Effexor daily for anxiety and fish oil and magnesium supplements daily. 

Over the past few months he has been getting sick to his stomach and vomiting daily, often 2-3 times per day - even on his non-drinking days.  He often complains of getting overheated just prior to vomiting, regardless of the actual temperature. Heat has never bothered him before.  He gets heartburn from time to time but doesn’t take medication for it. 

He is lacking energy. He used to be fairly active - playing golf, hiking, riding a bike etc but those activities have decreased greatly in the past year.  He doesn’t get out of breath but he often has to stop and rest even after doing normal household chores, etc.  When we were on vacation last month he was exhausted after walking around for a few hours and admitted he had zero energy and felt like he could sleep for days. He hadn’t been drinking the week of the trip. 

He bruises very easily.  He always has to an extent but it’s far worse.  This past weekend we assembled and moved some heavy furniture in our house and his arms and legs are now covered in large, deep purple bruises.  He did not fall or injure himself to my knowledge. I was doing the same work as him and I have none.

He knows something is wrong and says he’ll call the doctor but he never does.  I think he’s scared.

It’s usually the worst in the morning, and I do what I can to clear the mucus but it usually comes back by mid day.

I drink multiple cups of water a day. I also try to limit my dairy consumption as I know it’ll just make it worse. 

I brought this up to my doctor at my last checkup a few years back, as a result, she just examined my mouth/throat and suggested to me that it was probably caused by acid reflux and prescribed me omeprazole which did not help. And as much as I’ve tried limiting certain foods, my nose/throat condition remains the same.

15adwr3,"Awful tachycardia after eating.
I’m 21 and this started earlier this year. After I eat anything than plain protein (example: eggs) I get horrible tachycardia after about 25-30 minutes. I have been diagnosed with sinus tachycardia and ibs, both doctors told me it’s from my anxiety and I get that. But I don’t see how the tachycardia is from my anxiety?? I seriously CANNOT move after I eat and I don’t even eat a lot, I get full easily. I’ve done multiple blood work and they all come back normal. All the doctors keep telling me it’s just my anxiety. There are times it’s absolutely horrible and I cannot even move without my heart rate to skyrocket even up to 140 and there are times that it’s better and I don’t notice it that much. 

One thing I thought about is rapid gastric emptying or extreme gas build up due to my ibs that pushes everything together. Another thing that’s in my mind is POTS which a friend doctor has told me before I may have it but it’s not an official diagnosis.

Hello everyone,  
This is a trash account, because I don't want to be associated with my illness. I also put a ""NSFW"" flair because I'm going to talk about my ass.  
I'm 21M, from France, 80 kilograms, 1.80 metres, I work out, I don't smoke (for 3 years), I rarely drink alcohol and I don't do drugs.  
So, I've had hemorrhoidal problems and anal fissures for over 2 years now. At first I was careful to drink more water, then I was careful to eat more fiber, until today when I'm forced to take a laxative (macrogol) morning, and sometimes evening, to avoid anal fissure or hemorrhoids.  
I often, very often, have a tingling sensation around my anus, which heats up and often occurs after I've gone to the toilet, and the damage is magnified if I've forgotten to take my laxative. Besides, I've been cleaning my rear end with wipes for a long time now. And if one day I have the misfortune of wiping myself with toilet paper, the pain and discomfort are multiplied. So I'm forced to take my wipes with me.  
I'm well aware that hemorrhoids and anal fissures occur when our stools are too hard, when we don't eat enough fiber, don't drink enough water, eat spicy food and stay in the toilet too long. So of course, I take all these precautions to avoid future pain. And for the record, my stools are not hard, and not too complicated to expel.  
I saw several specialists. One told me it could be due to my perineum not being muscular enough. In fact, he also explained that it can happen when you do weight training (like me) or cycling. I didn't see any other sources talking about it. I also had a colonoscopy, and nothing abnormal (at least I'm safe that way!).  
I also understand that ass hairs can irritate the anus, and that seems quite logical in my case.  
So now, despite all the precautions I'm taking, I'd like to be able to rest easy and no longer have my anus irritated, stinging and burning.

After my gallbladder removal with complications (bile leak due to an accessory bile duct) and 2 ERCPs for placing a stent and removal of stent (which caused acute pancreatitis in october 2022) i have on going problems with:

yellow diarrhea, stomach pain, pain in the ribs,  problems with digestion (diarrhea or constipation), my upper belly is always bloated, only tolerate small amount of foods now, feeling full very quick.

Lipase is slightly elevated (86 U/L), liver levels are normal, elevated lactate levels, slightly lower eGFR levels, protein in urin since many years (maybe kidney related problems? Kidneys do look normal tho but i have a very small cyst).

Why is my Lipase elevated?
It's always elevated when i'm in pain but my doctors say i don't have chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic insufficiency.

MRI was made twice, pancreas looks normal.
MRCP was not possible because i start to struggle with breathing.

I live in germany and our gastroentologists mostly do endoscopies now. No one wants to treat me for my on going issues.

I may get an apppointment for a ""pancreas center"" but i have to wait 8 months...

I lost 10 Kilos and my blood also looks like i have a rare type of anemia? That's what they told me in the ER but my condition is not bad enough to be admitted (we have triage in germany).

After 2 MRIs, multiple X-rays, an ultrasound, 2 diagnostic injections (not a cortisone injection, but a 24-hour numbing injection to pinpoint problem area) and 6 doctors, they still aren’t sure what’s wrong. 

Nothing significant showed up on my latest MRI, other than what the doctor called “an irregularity.” He wasn’t sure if it was just inflammation, or possibly a very small cartilage tear in my joint. 

I have been sent to a rheumatologist to see if my pain is being caused by an autoimmune disorder since they can’t find anything on my scans (I have some hip pain, knee pain, etc) and I have had some blood markers come back as positive (positive ANA & ACA). I’m still following up with the rheumatologist, however, no one can determine yet if this is an isolated injury in my foot or being caused by an autoimmune disorder. 

The latest podiatrist that I saw, who I really liked, mentioned the chance of surgery since this hasn’t fully healed since October. However, I’m not even sure what he’d do surgery on since he can’t pinpoint what exactly is wrong. 

So, I’m wondering how dangerous it is to do surgery without knowing what’s wrong? What are the risks of them opening me up & finding nothing? How long would the healing process be if they don’t perform any operation, other than just opening up my foot? Is this even viable?

So for the past few weeks I (26F) have been having health issues which mainly consisted of petechiae all over my legs, shortness of breath with heart palpitations/racing, difficulty with eating due to nausea & bloating with some bowel/urinary issues that seem to flare up (most likely due to my recent bad eating habits) so I was sent for some blood tests yesterday, in which today my doctor texted me to get in touch. I was told that everything was somewhat normal, except my potassium levels were slightly elevated. I was told not to worry, and had blood tests rearranged for next week. 

I did what anyone naturally did and looked up what high potassium means & kind of gave myself some health anxiety, and I’m now paranoid since almost everything that I eat is high in potassium so I’m paranoid on eating those foods for the time being. I understand I’m probably overthinking things, but I can’t help but worry considering as mentioned, I have quite a few symptoms that add up, but whether these symptoms are just coincidence or not I guess time will tell.

Health background: Hashimotos, insulin resistance. Medication: Synthroid 50 mcg daily, metformin daily 

Drugs: never
Drinking: used to drink 3-4 times a week but have since reduced it to once a week 

I’ve been getting intermittent pain in my RUQ starting about 5 years ago (2018) Went to a GI then, did an abdominal ultrasound and they found a hemangioma told me it was small and not causing symptoms and that I had some trapped gas and eventually after maybe a month - the pain went away. 

2019 - same type of pain pops up (RUQ, feels like it’s my liver, but sometimes goes down the right side of my abdomen and almost my back). Since I had just gone to the doctor a year prior assumed it was trapped gas and it eventually went away. 

It basically came and went almost every year and almost every year it goes away. 

6 weeks ago however - the pain has come back. This time it feels worse? It hurts when I stretch it, hurts when I press on it. Radiates to kind of my right flank and just feels like something is gripping onto that areas. Sometimes the pain will be sharp and I’ve noticed it’s a lot worse after I do any type of core focused workout like wood chops or windmills or something. My lower back hurts a lot too. It feels like one long side stitch but it moves and sometimes it pulsates. I’m losing weight but I’ve just lost 12 lbs in a month and I think it’s because I’m trying. I don’t have any lethargy or anything in fact I’ve been able to maintain a 4-5 day a week workout schedule. 

I went to see the GI and he’s ordering an ultrasound but I’m so scared of what the results might hold. In my head everything is bad and there’s no way this hurts this bad and it’s not anything serious (I know this is anxiety - I’m seeing a professional). 

My question to any professionals is that, could this maybe be just muscular? Have patients come in with a lot of pain for it to be something benign? I’m just very scared, like I’m struggling to function at this point.

So I was hit on my brow bone this weekend. Little bit of a black eye (I don't bruise easily), followed by pressure headache the next day and fallowing day extremely drowsy with head pressure. 

I have in the past 3 years hit my head in this exact area 2 other times. The first time left a dent in my forehead. 

I feel pressure over my eye extending backward over my ear. Could I have a subdural hematoma? Should I get checked by my doctor? Or just let it self resolve. I am not elderly or sick.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15ab2dc/head_injury/,32.0,,

I’m a 29yo female. I have major generalized anxiety and depression that I do not take medications for. I had a right anterior tibial tubercle osteotomy and medial patellofemoral ligament repair 7/13. Currently taking Aspirin EC  81mg once daily, hydro/acetaminophen 10-325 every 4-6 hours for pain, and ondansetron 4mg prn for nausea.

15M and pretty much exactly what the title says. I can fall asleep fine, but I can’t stay asleep. I’ll wake up around 2-3 hours after initially falling asleep and then won’t go back to sleep until the morning, where I’ll only be able to sleep for a maximum of 3 more hours before I have to get up. I’ve looked in to the many causes of sleep issues, (eating/drinking too close to bedtime, blue light exposure too close to bed time, too hot/too cold, etc.) and have corrected as many as I could, however the problem just won’t go away. I take melatonin, and go to the gym almost daily. My doctor recommended taking Benadryl if melatonin didn’t do it for me, but I don’t wanna become dependent on sleeping pills or anything like that. The only hypothesis I have on what could still be causing this would possibly be stress overload and/or overthinking, which has been an issue for me since I was a little kid. This theory is kind of supported by my most recent vacation with family; we went camping and I had a lot of fun and was very happy during that time, and had no problem sleeping whatsoever. My sleep was better, but still a little rough (waking up 2-3 times a night for 15-30 minutes) after, until a few days ago, when my sister said something that kind of touched a sensitive spot, and I got really angry, so angry that I got a headache (the one I have when I’m stressed) and my chest felt all tight, and that night was when it all started again. I saw online that an herbal supplement, ashwagandha, reduces stress and relaxes you, which I think would help me be able to sleep, so I bought some, but haven’t taken it yet because I heard it causes hormonal issues and hasn’t really been studied in teens. I know it’s important not to interfere with hormones as a teenager, but it’s also important to sleep well as a teenager, so I’m stuck. I really need to get this sorted out before school starts, otherwise my life will be a living hell.

4M Caucasian/black 17kg, history of adenoidectomy, ? Iron deficient anemia, recently told he has sickle cell trait, OSA (currently followed by ENT for potential tonsillectomy)

After a fever lasting eight days, I took my son into the Children’s Hospital, where they performed a bunch of bloodwork and swabs, and found out he was strep positive. They also informed me that his hemoglobin was low (99) and iron levels are extremely low (2). I began him on iron supplementation and did follow up bloodwork (which I will post) a month and a half later. We found out that he has sickle cell trait (so does his father) and that has iron went from 2 to 6 (so still lower than the lower limit). 

 My doctor is referring us to a hematologist to follow up further, but in the meantime, I am wondering if the iron deficiency anaemia can have anything to do with sickle cell trait?

I, 21F (330lbs, 5'11""), always been prone to ear and sinus infections, but it's gotten worse since I got my tonsils and adenoids removed (in 2013ish). Recently it's been really bad. Just over a month ago I had a ear infection, sinus infection, bronchitis, and double pink eye. I could hardly blow anything out of my nose and I tried a Neti Pot, which didn't help. I eventually blew out a massive booger that was dry, crusty, chunky, sticky, red, green, and brown! I almost threw up because i felt it release from the back of my throat.I tried humid and dry environments and nothing helped. My Doc put me on antibiotics and that seemed ti help. 

Currently I have the same issue minus the pink eye. I blew out the same booger but it wasnt red at all, just brown and green. My eats are plugged and it's hard to blow my nose. It's also causing sore throat and this weird, dry, mostly unproductive cough. I've tried sudafed and dayquil/nyquil and it doesn't do much for me.

I don't smoke, vape, or do any drugs. I do have asthma and i had tubes in my ears when I was younger, but I've since had them removed. I have experience second hand smoke as a lot of my family smokes around me.

15ac9pj,"Question about HPV vaccine
Where I live (Netherlands) teenagers get offered a vaccine against sexually transmitted HPV, but many don't end up getting it (often because of their parents, which is also the case for me). This year they've made it free to get it as an adult if you were born after 1995, so I've been thinking about getting it. I'm 23 and married. 

I know that it's still worth getting if you've already had sex and if you only have one sexual partner, etc. My question is: is it worth getting if you have only had one partner, if they've only had one partner too and if you're planning to stay monogamous for the rest of your life? Of course you can never know 100% certain whether it works out that way, but for now I'm just going to assume that it does.

I've tried to look it up and also asked a few people about it, but didn't really get a clear answer. If getting the vaccine can still actually protect me against something I'm happy to go get it, if there's a 99% certainty that it won't matter I don't really see the point. The same is true for my partner. 

I don't know if this is a stupid question but no one I've asked seems to really know for sure.

TL;DR I [14M] who does lots of public speaking and debating faints while debating even though I wasn’t nervous and without any history of anything like this before. 

So first a bit of backstory I [14M] do lots of debating and public speaking comps inside and outside of school. I am never overly nervous just a little bit - a healthy amount I guess. I never have butterflies in the stomach or get shaky or get sweaty.

Last night was the 2nd round in the finals draw for our debating competition and I was feeling good but when I got up to speak everything fell apart. As third speaker I do mostly rebuttals in my speech and my rebuttals are not very prepared and I speak mostly off the cuff. When I started my rebuttals I noticed that my brain was thinking of what I should be saying but my mouth didn’t want to say those words. Normally when I’ll third speaking I do this perfectly fine but for some reason my “mouth didn’t want to mouth” as my friend said. In other words I could speak just I was speaking not what my brain was telling me to speak.

On the next palm card I could feel the blood rushing from by face but I pushed through (very stupid in retrospect I know). Next palm card I could feel my hands getting clammy and started sweating profusely so I took of my jumper and blazer (I don’t know why I was sweating it was a cold night and the room was quite cold as well). I also started to notice a slight ringing in my ears. I also started to feel dizzy.
Then on my fourth palm card everything went blurry and sounded muffed and I collapsed. Didn’t hit my head on the way down according to our coach and was out for only a couple seconds. 

When I woke up everything was blurry I could only make out people by their voices which sounded muffed and distance like I was wearing noice canceling headphone while they were trying to speak to me from the other side of an oval. It took about 10-15 minutes to recover and even after then I still wasn’t fully better. 

Fast forward to this morning I am feeling better but I have got a mild headache (not sure if it relates to the fainting but I didn’t have it as far as I am aware before the debate). I have had not history of fainting for any reason. I did feel slightly nauseous on the way to the venue that went away once I arrived. I am not feeling stressed at school, quite the opposite actually - I am bored. I have taken on a few more extracurriculars in the last couple weeks but haven’t been stressed about them.

This month I saw some weird fleshy-jelly like consistency on pad that’s mostly brown like coffee grains and has a few pink-red fleshy consistency 

It’s been painful, with back cramping which isn’t typical for me either.

I visited the doctor 3 weeks ago bc I thought I got candida bc I had been having a thrush on my gland and my gf had had it. He recommended me an antifungal cream (Imazol cream) and I applied it for two weeks. I thought it was getting better but after the treatment the lips of my urethra began to get irritated and a small white wound started showing. It hurts when I pee and also the gland is very irritated with white little wounds opening. I think it is slowly getting better but I don't really know what it is. Maybe this has nothing to do with candida and it s caused bc a little injury or friction that I didnt notice. But what could it be?

15acj76,"Electroconvulsive Therapy Treatment
I have severe, treatment-resistant depression. Tomorrow, I have an appointment set up to decide what treatment to go forward with. I'm leaning towards ECT, but my parents are concerned that I will have long-term memory loss or that I could end up in a group home for the rest of my life if one of the shocks that I'm given will shock me too much. I've talked to multiple doctors and I've done my own research and while getting long-term memory loss is a possibility in rare cases, nowhere have I been told that I could end up in a group home.

My other options are ketamine (which can be given through an IV or nasal spray), or TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation). 

My concern for ketamine is that it's a new treatment for depression where the long-term side-effects are unknown and even if I do the treatment now, it's likely I will have to get treatment again later in life. 

I don't have too much concern for ECT other than the side-effects but I suppose those side-effects are not that much worse than the side-effects I already have from my medicine.

Other info: 
- My insurance covers all of these treatments but I will have to pay for the treatments co-pay by myself. 
- One set of treatments usually lasts 2-4 months, 2-5 times a week, but this varies depending on the person and the type of treatment.
- I will have to take a bus to these treatments.

15acbfk,"My muscle injuries won't heal even after 5 years of rest
So when i was 18 i used to do both calisthenics and weight lifting, i wasn't really careful with warming up or taking precautions. as days go by, i started noticing a little stiffness point in my upper chest and i could feel that the spot is so small (i mean just a dot in the middle where the muscle attaches to the bone i think it's the tendon, not the entire muscle) and this feeling like i have a knot blocking the movement kept going everytime i do dips or chest with cables but it wasn't that painful so i ignored it and kept training hoping it would go away but it didn't.  


Until one day i was rowing (back training) until that knot snaps and my upper chest hurts like hell everytime i use that muscle.  
So after this accident i was told i should fully recover after 15 days, so i quit training but it didn't even after 5 years of rest that spot still hurts everytime i try to do simple push ups or any chest exercise.  


I have seen many doctors and done many rehabilitation techniques and exercises but nothing seems to work, even the doctors couldn't give a diagnosis because the ultrasound showed no anomaly in that spot.

I want to know if anyone have faced this case before and solved the problem because i have quit every sort of training because of these injuries ( I have other identical injuries in my back, leg and shoulder with the same type of feeling i only described the one in the chest so that the post won't be too long)  


I would really appreciate someone giving me the slightest of light of information about this, idk if the doctors in my country (algeria) are stupid, or these are chronic tendon injuries that will never heal, or my body is just weird. the thing that bugs me is when i see these famous athletes have way more severe injuries than mine but they recover perfectly, and im out here with nothing after 5 years.

15awg37,"My menstrual cycle has become very erratic but tests showed no underlying conditions. Is it worth getting a second opinion?
Hi, Docs! Thanks for any advice you can give me:  
**Basic stats:** Female, 35, 171cm, 80 kilos.  
**Pre-existing conditions:** ADHD, mild infectious asthma, history of PPD/A  
**Medications:** Concerta (54mg) and ritalin (20mg)  
**Location:** Malta, Europe

I went to my regular gynecologist for testing because my periods have started behaving quite erratically since the start of this year. As of last week, I've had my period 11 times since the start of the year, usually with one longer cycle (24-26 days) followed by one really short cycle (10-15 days). My cycles have always been on the short side (21-24 days was my normal average), but otherwise regular.

It had happened previously that during periods of high stress my period might arrive early for one cycle, but it's never kept going for this long. I was quite stressed at the beginning of the year, but life has calmed down a lot now, though it seems no one has told my ovaries that. Additional complaints are really heavy mood swings and acne along my jaw. I have had some insomnia and brain fog, but with the ADHD, those have been pretty standard for my whole life, though my medication has seemed less effective lately.

I recieved the following tests: ultrasound, smear test, FSH-LH-Prolactin-Testosterone blood test, Thyroid function blood test. All were clear. I had an insurance physical recently where I also got a clean bill of health for my blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting glucose, etc. I'm working on my weight.

My doctor told me she'd like to wait for a couple of months to see if it clears up with a bit of diet and exercise, and if nothing changes then to look at hormonal solutions. I have historically been pretty bad at taking the pill, but the last time I was taking it was before I started being treated for ADHD, so maybe I'll be better now. Also, my worry isn't just making my cycle better but fixing whatever is causing it to fluctuate (if possible).

I guess I'm just annoyed that there seems to be no medical reason for this sudden change. Don't get me wrong, I'm very happy there isn't any long term issue to worry about, but it's frustrating that there doesn't seem to be any answer for why this is happening. So, is it worth seeking a second opinion just to be sure?  


**Tl;dr:** 11 periods in 7 months, slightly overweight and stressed, but otherwise apparently healthy. Does this just happen with no explanation or should I get a second opinion?

About 1 day after getting a Hep B vaccine (part one of two) I (28F) developed a case of full body hives that waxes and wanes but never goes away on its own. 

It’s been five weeks since the vaccine. They are itchy and blotchy and happen most painfully on my thighs, calves, and arms but also appear on my hands (palms and backs) and feet. One day my eyelids swelled shut and they were all over my face). They are itchy and ache very badly). Also my hands are so swollen in the morning I stopped wearing rings.

I am fully vaccinated for every possible thing (Covid, yearly flu shots, mumps, multiple tetanus, 3-part hep B as a child, HPV, etc) and never ever ever had a skin reaction. I’ve never even had a reaction like this to the one thing I am allergic to (dog dander).

A Zyrtec will reduce the itchy ness for 36-48 hours but the blotches and swelling are still visible.

I won’t have access to a PCP until two weeks from now and the employee health service just told me “oh that’s weird, don’t get the second dose” and gave me the impression they don’t think it’s the vaccine and don’t really care. 

Is this all in my head? Have I spontaneously developed an autoimmune disease? 

What things should I tell the PCP so that they take me seriously? (History of doctors dismissing things that are chronic and not easily diagnosable). 

They are so itchy painful and swollen once the Zyrtec wears off sometimes I sit in my work bathroom and cry until the next dose kicks in

15bapqn,"Bone bruise (second toe) still hurting after seven months
Hello, hopefully someone can help me. So I (32F) stubbed my second toe really hard in early December 2022. The toe turned black and blue and was swollen at the time. I was told it was likely a bruised bone and to do the RICE method and give it time. I did not get an x-ray or anything else. Because I have chronic illness (mystery gut pain, fibromyalgia, vertigo, brain fog, Raynaud’s), I was told it was normal it was taking longer than usual for the pain to go away, that the Raynaud’s itself was delaying the healing, but that things would clear in time. 

It’s been seven months now and the toe slowly got better over time, even though it gets slightly swollen and bright red from time to time (happens when the Raynaud’s flares up and looks more red or darker than the rest of the foot when it does). The pain had gone away and it was just the color that was still about a shade darker than the rest of my foot. But now really hot where I live, and the toe started hurting really bad again in the heatwave, even making it hard to be on my feet. 

I was told that by this point, my options would be either to leave it and deal with the pain, or to get surgery, which I want to avoid at all costs.

I’m asking for opinions here because the amount of times I’ve seen doctors, had multiple tests done that came to nothing, had my concerns dismissed and still had to deal with my health problems because I couldn’t get medical help is beyond belief, so I don’t want to put myself through that again if I can help it.

15aypdq,"Signs of cholestasis?
24yr old female, 21 weeks pregnant (first pregnancy)

Hey everyone, I have already sought advice in the maternity hospital I'm attending and just want to see how other people's experiences/opinions compare with what I was told.

Last Friday I had a Dr's appointment for just a general pregnancy check up, (this Dr is a general practitioner not an obgyn as that is the norm where I live). She did the usual BP check and doppler and everything looked good. Then she said she wanted to do some bloods as I haven't done bloods with her since becoming pregnant (have done them in my maternity hospital though). 

On Tuesday she called me to say one of the numbers relating to my liver came back high, my ALT was at 61 (had bloods done just before becoming pregnant and this number was at 16). She asked when my next hospital appointment was which was the following day for my anomaly scan and she told me she wanted me to bring in a copy of the blood results to discuss with them, which I did.

In the mean time I had a look online (not advised I know) but I came across more than one source stating this number can be an indication of cholestasis and should typically decrease in pregnancy and be below a result of 33. The figure of 33 as an upper limit was also quoted on a source I found from the hospital I'm attending. As far as I know no tests for bile acids have been done.

When I raised this is the hospital they didn't seem that concerned, they did more blood work where my ALT had dropped down to 46, which is better but still above the 33 I've seen quoted. They made it seem like unless i was experiencing itching that these numbers didn't really matter? Does everyone with cholestasis always experience the extremely itchy palms of their hands and soles of their feet? 

I feel a bit dismissed but my only option would be to go back and hope to see someone else and possibly a better explanation but theres no guarantee! Can a person be diagnosed with cholestasis without experiencing the itchiness? Or should numbers close to mine be treated as something to be concerned about? 

I'm not trying to seem like a drama queen and I don't want to waste any of the hospital staffs time, but obviously cholestasis can have devastating results so I'm just finding it hard to feel completely at ease with how things went in the hospital yesterday.

If you've read all of this I really appreciate it! And if you've any experience with/knowledge of cholestasis or blood results similar to mine it would be amazing if you could leave a comment for me.

For context: I am 20f, 5’7, 52kg/ 114lbs, lead a moderately active lifestyle (exercise 2-3 times a week) and have no STIs or any known medical conditions. All my blood tests have come back completely healthy and there is no indicators of ill health etc that I am aware of. 

Basically what the title is saying. I’ve noticed that for the past year, I get a cold exactly one week before my period. 

I’m ill 1/4 weeks of the month. 
These colds are mostly coughing & headaches- not really flu like or anything but just incessant coughing, throat hurts and head hurts sometimes. 

I know your immunity can drop a little due to hormonal changes at different points of the menstrual cycle but this is just insane? I feel like it’s really abnormal how often I am ill. It has been affecting my quality of life so much as I have little energy to do stuff, my coughing keeps me up at night, I spend more than what I can afford on medicine etc…

I went to a physical doctor about this and she was completely useless to put it kindly. She was insisting that I have hay fever despite me saying that I have these symptoms all year round and I don’t feel any worse when around plants. She was just not willing to listen and prescribed me a bunch of hay fever meds. I thought, hell, she might be right, I should trust a doctor and just get these medications. I ended up spending so much money on these medications and getting so much worse despite using them exactly as instructed. 

My colds persisted- I have about 3 healthy weeks (at best) before I get sick again. It’s ruining my life and I have no idea what to do hence why I have turned to reddit of all places. 
Another thing I’ve notices is that AC triggers it a lot. I don’t have AC at home and absolutely hate it- 5 minutes with the AC on and I immediately get a headache, dry throat and I start coughing. I don’t know how relevant that is but I thought I’d mention it anyway. 

I obviously don’t know if the cold and periods are inherently linked but I feel like it’s too much of a consistent ‘coincidence’? I honestly feel like I’m going crazy.. I feel like a conspiracy theorist or something! I desperately need some advice.

I am 30M, white, about 5'11"" 380lbs. In early June I underwent an anal fistula surgery. Since then, I have been having very loose stools, not fully liquid diarrhea but enough to wipe many many times after, and still not get it all. The stools are a dark mustard color.

I found out that an anal douche can help with cleaning the area, so I have been using that and it seems to work for cleanliness-sake but it obviously doesn't fix the underlying issue of the stools.

Also since surgery, after I clean my butt (with or without the douche), I find that more seems to leak out later on. I will get a feeling that there is something wet between my cheeks or in my pants and I will go the bathroom and wipe and sure enough there is more of the never-ending mustard-colored poop. It's practically anal incontinence. I am at a complete loss and this is beyond frustrating.

I talked with my doctor who performed the surgery numerous times and he says it will get better with time, as fistulas can take up to 2 or so months to heal (and mine was pretty bad from what I hear). But would that affect bowel movements? He also recommended taking soluble fiber supplements like Benefiber and Metamucil, which I have been taking now for over a month daily. 

So far my workaround for the leaking bowels is to shove gauze up there to help soak it up so my clothes don't get ruined or stained. I can't keep being dependent on gauze or douching for this.

I (22F) have had a UTI for over a month and my urine is still testing positive for leucocytes and protein.

I had been experiencing this for 2 weeks but had assumed it was related to the hot weather. The dipstick test showed ++125 WBC/μL leucocytes, ++100 mg/DL protein. I managed to get an appointment with a nurse practitioner the same day, who also tested my urine and gave me a three day course of antibiotics (Nitrofuratonin 100mg/day). The report I can see on my NHS app shows the same results as my home test.

15b17dh,"I had a heart attack last night
M13 (soon 14), 6ft, 165 lbs

Little about me: I grew up in a household with abusive parents, a lot of second hand smoking, pills, drinking, shit air and a lot of stress. I love basketball and I play basketball at least 5 hours a day by myself or with others. I eat as healthy as I can and work out 5 days a week for an hour or two every day, cardio, balance, flexibility and strength and the reason I do this is because I want to be in the NBA when I grow up

So yesterday I heard that Lebron son Bronny had a heart attack and was rushed to the hospital, and when I read this my heart started skipping and beating really hard, I had to stand up and I felt dizzy and couldn’t catch my breath and I told my mom to call the ambulance but before she did my heart calmed down. Do I need to go to the doctor to check my heart out? Do I need to stop working out, what happened? I won’t play basketball today and I’ll drink water to see if it happens again and if it does I’ll go to the doctor to see if they can scan my heart.

Updating because I forgot to add more information:
My diet consists of around 4000 calories a day, I eat a lot of meat and fish, I like bananas too (I heard too many bananas can cause heart issues), so maybe that’s my issue that I eat too many bananas?

Hello,

I have these sudden brown spots appearing on my face shortly after my RA diagnosis. I’m assuming it’s from one of the new meds I’m taking. I’m worried about it being or turning into skin cancer and am wondering if/when I should get it checked out. 

Relevant new meds: Enbrel, 50mg. Methotrexate, 2.5mg (10 weekly). For pain until inflammation/meds are under control I take Celecoxib 100mg once daily, Prednisone 5mg once daily.

15b1ljo,"Desperately need reassurance about my heart.
(20F, no known heart conditions, had a normal ECG but my heart was behaving during it)

A few months ago I was woken up to my heart beating the fastest I’ve ever felt it beat in my entire life. I haven’t had an episode like it since, thankfully.

No bad dream, no sleep apnea, definitely not a typical panic attack for me - I wasn’t even anxious, although I’m now overthinking all of my previous ‘panic attacks’ and wondering if they were actually something else.

It subsided within a few minutes, but HOLY FUCK has it left me unsettled. I’m 95% sure I experienced something called an SVT episode - I still remember the rhythm because of how damn terrifying it was, and it matched the rhythm of at least 200BPM. Yes, I can genuinely tap it out for you because of how traumatised I am. That, combined with it stopping relatively quickly, basically confirm that it was probably that… and I am terrified of it happening again.

I’ve told my doctor that it traumatised me and that it wasn’t a panic attack TWICE. He didn’t believe me, so then I sent him Apple Watch screenshots of my heart rate [suddenly dropping to the 40s and 50s daily](https://www.reddit.com/r/medical_advice/comments/14zfok8/surely_id_know_if_my_heart_rate_was_suddenly/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1) (something else about my heart that scares me, not sure if it actually happens or not, but hey, thought it’d help) but again, he doesn’t care - he just said that watches aren’t the most reliable thing… I’ve read of cardiologists who ask their patients to buy Apple Watches!

I’m worried because it apparently happens every day, multiple times a day, and has done for **five years** at least. I’m not even someone who exercises that much/is athletic… I’m 20F, although I am only 5’0 and 45.5kg, so maybe my heart doesn’t need to work as hard? I don’t know. It’s usually around 80 BPM.

Sometimes it’ll stay low for a few minutes then go back up (sometimes this’ll happen multiple times in a row with a few minutes in between, almost like it’s struggling…) and other times it’ll stay in the 40-50 range for up to half an hour or even longer (it’s done it for an hour or more on multiple occasions).

I have also noticed that my heart rate variability in the health app is very low (as low as 10) which scares me because I read that that can be a sign of dysautonomia. I’m genuinely convinced that SOMETHING is wrong with my heart. Or my central nervous system.

I told my doctor that I’m concerned because I sometimes feel tired, or even dizzy (could be anxiety though) and he just said that watches aren’t accurate. Maybe I could have sleep apnea since I can’t breathe through my nose, because sleep apnea can cause the heart condition I’m worried about (Sick Sinus Syndrome/Tachy-Brady Syndrome)?

I’m so so so stressed over this and I don’t know what to do. If it was actually happening, I’d be symptomatic, right? I don’t know if it even actually happens or not because I don’t feel it, but the consistency of the data is quite convincing - **FIVE YEARS’ worth across two different devices, showing it practically DAILY.**

I stopped wearing the watch because I was checking my heart rate religiously after I discovered all of this by mistake. I caught a few dips to 50 and below but only ten minutes after they happened.

My anxiety is screaming at me to push for tests and a holter monitor to see if it actually happens or not but my doctor is saying I don’t need any tests.

I wish I never checked my health app. This has fucked me up since the day I saw it, because of how regularly it happens and how sometimes it’ll rise and fall over and over. But I’d know after five years if there was a problem, right?

All I want is some tests to confirm that my heart is okay, but reassurance is bad for anxiety because it subconsciously affirms that the anxious thoughts (e.g. that something is wrong with your heart) are real. I’m trying to hold off on asking again, but it is SO hard.

Sometimes I’ll get sudden PVCs (palpitations) so hard that they make me audibly gasp because they’ve knocked the wind out of me.

I have felt so alone with the potential SVT experience and I’ve been living in fear of it happening again. It’s scarier than any panic attack I’ve ever experienced - I was completely breathless and stunned by how hard and fast my heart was slamming against my chest… it felt dangerous and I was convinced I was gonna die because of how abnormal and sudden it was.

Apparently stress can trigger it (I don’t fully buy that because is it not caused by an electrical error?) but I’m so scared that there’s something wrong with my heart that caused it that I’ll never know about until it happens again (or it never will but something still might be wrong).

I don’t wanna be one of those people that has it again. And again. And again. You know? One time has already traumatised me enough.

Sometimes my heart vibrates (best way I can describe it) or skips beats when I feel my pulse which makes me mentally lose it, although the sudden thumps are almost equally as unnerving.

I would KILL for an echo (where they do a scan of your heart). Knowing that my heart is structurally fine and able to handle it would help me so much. Plus knowing how well it functions (the scan provides a percentage) would be a big relief.

I read that it can get dangerous if it goes on for too long because it can lead to a drop in blood pressure/blood oxygen due to your heart not being able to open up sufficiently due to the speed, or it can damage your heart, and freaked out.

My anxiety cannot comprehend that something that scary can be ‘benign’ when it’s caused by an electrical error - it makes me wonder what caused that error and if it’s something that’s like a switch that can be randomly turned on if you have that switch there. It seems like most people don’t?

A few questions:

* Can you be predisposed to SVT for benign reasons? Is SVT itself benign/not dangerous? Or does something have to be wrong with your heart for that to be the case (like an extra pathway)?
* Is it possible for me to have an episode because of an external factor and for it to never happen again? I’ve never had once for the first 19 years of my life.
* Would I know if my heart rate was dropping that low?",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15b1ljo/desperately_need_reassurance_about_my_heart/,20.0,Female,Self

I was breathing through my nose and mouth at the same time while wearing the respirator.

I woke up today a little bit better, sore throat is gone but still feel my chest like it has something there like fleme. I cough trying to remove the fleme but nothing happens. Headache is gone.

I got my adenoids removed as a kid.

This was the second time in 3 weeks that I used the brand new respirator. Now Im wondering wether Im sensitive to wearing this gear or could have been bacteria buildup. The first time I used it I just sprayed atomized pharmacy alcohol inside of it and stored it with paper towel.

Wednesday evening (38 hours ago) was at the gym, and was getting ready to use the incline chest press machine. When I went to push the bar upwards, the seat lodged backwards a little and my head hit against the padded surface of the head rest. I didn’t think too much of it so kept with the workout (wasn’t a heavy workout or extreme). I stopped the workout a few sets later as I started to get a headache and feared a concussion.

I saw a walk in doctor yesterday who did an exam and concluded it likely wasn’t a concussion due to the fact I hit a padded surface and it was not a huge fall (the seat lodged back only a few cm at most), and that I didn’t have any key symptoms. For context, I had a concussion 8-9 years ago, and it’s definitely not as “bad” as it was back then.

However, I still have this headache in the back of my head that kind of radiates to the top portion of my head, and another odd symptom that seems to be new is whenever I drink cold water I almost feel like I get a minuscule “brain freeze”.  In terms of symptoms, that’s basically it, no vomiting, maybe a little nausea here and there but nothin crazy, no confusion or loss of bodily functions etc. I do seem to have hot flashes every now and then though.

What worries me is I’m in the middle of my exam season and have one tonight so naturally I am studying, and I’m worried I’m causing more damage?

15b57ot,"What would cause a swollen bump in my wrist to exist for years and then disappear?
27M (FTM Trans), 5'9, 300ishlbs, White, Smoke marijuana but never tobacco, drink maybe 2x a year on average. Meds: Testosterone 100mg/wk subq inj, Adderall 20mg 2x daily, Buspar 15mg 2x daily. Outside of mental health conditions I have unrelated osteoporosis in my ankle, slightly high blood pressure, and the weight is a thing. I suspect I may have fibromyalgia, my mom has it and I have a lot of the symptoms she has, I've had a traumatic injury to trigger it, but never had it diagnosed. 

Around age 23 I started developing pain in my right wrist and hand from repetitive stress, I used to be a barista, I did macrame for a few years and I've since always had an office job and study computer programming and draw a lot in my free time. So I spend a lot of time using my hands and all of my hobbies surround it, I know that's why I have either carpal or radial tunnel syndrome (pain shoots up the pinky side of my hand and goes to my elbow sometimes) and I'm going to the doctor for it tomorrow. By 25 I had to take breaks regularly from doing anything for weeks at a time sometimes because I'd be in such constant pain, and now I can't even consistently write without being in pain within a few minutes. Nothing OTC touches it and I don't really want medication pain management bc my parents are both addicts. 

Primary concern since about age 24 has been a large swollen tendon sheath or muscle on the side of my right wrist below my thumb. I don't have pictures but it easily pushed out like half an inch during really bad flare ups. Ice and heat helped a little but it was pretty constant even if there wasn't any pain. I also started stretching it but I'm not  very consistent with it. My left wrist to this day still feels smooth, but my right wrist has a little bump there still. 

I started testosterone about a year ago and in the last year the swelling has gone down almost entirely just leaving a little bump you can't see but you can feel. I have been working out more in the last month or so trying to ease the pain by giving my wrists more support from the rest of my muscles but the swelling of that tendon has been gone well before that.

So what could have happened? Was it the testosterone, because I know that can thicken my ligaments and strengthen my joints a little? Or the increase of muscle mass/50lbs or so I have lost from it? Or was it just bc I have ignored it for so long that it healed on it's own? 

  
Thank you for your time, I am going to the dr for it tomorrow with the hopes of getting a cortisone shot to ease the pain since i've had great luck with it in my ankle and it helped me heal a herniated disc in my spine. I just wanted a little more info about this cause I want to bring the bump up to my Dr but if it went away am not even sure if it is relevant.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15b57ot/what_would_cause_a_swollen_bump_in_my_wrist_to/,27.0,Male,Self
15b5fjt,"Question regarding son's diagnosis, follow up scheduled soon.
TLDR; 15Y MALE has multiple diagnosis but I feel like it's actually ASD and don't know how to approach his psychiatrist.

My 15y/o son has always struggled with...well, life. Even as a baby he was somehow ""different"" but I've never been able to articulate it. The only way to describe it is that he never wanted to be held, he seemed distressed by it, and he always seemed kind of off in his own world. He was most content when laying on the floor with minimal stimulation and one or two simple toys. 

As a toddler he had ARFID (he was eating less than 10 different foods at age 4) and participated in intensive OT for feeding, fine motor skills, and also SLP for apraxia.

Once he began school his struggles became extremely obvious. However,  our public school sulustem is trash and he fell through the cracks because he wasn't a problem child. 

After years of pushing for help he finally received psychometric testing and psychiatric consultation at age 9. 

He was diagnosed with the following: 
-ADHD inattentive type
-Sensory Processing Disorder 
-Generalized Anxiety Disorder 
-Developmental Coordination Disorder 
-Learning Disability (reading writing math)
-Specific Learning Disability (reading writing math)
-Non Verbal Learning Disorder (psychiatrist describes this as ""ASD's step sister"") 

His psychologist who performed his psychometric testing was honestly baffles. She said she's never seen results quite like his in her 20yr career and her report was over 20 pages long. I submitted this to his psychiatrist and he agreed with everything. 

Now he's 15y and in highschool and his social and emotional differences are becoming quite evident. It's always been my gut feeling that he's on the Spectrum. One of my past jobs was as a Developmental support worker for teens with ASD and/or other Developmental disabilities...so I'm not unfamiliar with the basic criteria. 

My question is...how do all of his different diagnosis NOT equal an ASD diagnosis? 



I really want to ask his psychiatrist about this next week...but im unsure how to approach the question. 

[Disclaimer: I really don't care what the diagnosis is in terms of slapping a label on him.. I just want to be able to access every resource that could possibly help him in life. Unfortunately,  a formal diagnosis opens those doors.]

Good afternoon. I’ve been dealing with an issue that’s been really puzzling, over the past year.

I recently moved to Brooklyn, and have been living on my own. I’ve been getting sick on and off every few months since living there. To start, I had a lot of respiratory infections. I do not smoke cigarettes. Not sure if this is TMI, but my phlegm was the color dark brown/dark green. It looked a lot like the green Jello, consistency and everything. It would also be paired with fever. 

These issues would go away on there own. I saw a pulmonologist and I was told my lungs is in good health and was given antibiotics, with no answer in terms of what it could be. Zpac as an example. It seemed like the medications never worked, and the issue went away on its own. Shortly after 1-2 months, it would comeback. 

Fast forward to today, I’ve been still getting sick on and off, with flu like symptoms. (It seems like phlegm hasn’t happened in 4 months or so. I’ll have Intense body aches, and fever. On top of these issues, i feel very much weak and lethargic most of my days.

In general, the experience went well, except for chaotic thoughts and a strange ""hit"" in the left hand. However, after we parted and I went to bed, I realized that I had spent an hour half asleep, experiencing some unreal events.

And since then, I've had a few problems. The first is pain in the limbs and weakness in them. Secondly, my mood has become unstable. I also notice that objects seem strange, as if they are right in front of my eyes, like delusional and now I am afraid to even touch things, because the sensations have become too intense.

41

Male

5'11""

~200lbs last annual

Caucasian 

Duration of complaint: A week on and off symptoms and varying severity 

Location: US

Any existing relevant medical issues: Hypertension treated successfully with 10m Lisinopril, Acid Reflux treated successfully with weight loss and dietary/lifestyle changes (issue free until now since 2019, and this feels different such as dull ache with bloat/lower abdomen discomfort/pain rather than upper GI pain/acid like previously)

Current medications: OTC Antacid(s) seems to make the issue somewhat tolerable for now on the bad mornings/days. I also sleep upright with a wedge.

Basically, about a week ago I woke up feeling extremely bloated and chalked it up to eating too much the previous night of something that must have irritated my lower GI/abdomen. Since, I have eliminated medium+ sized portions and been vigilant with my food intake yet the symptoms of a dull ache/constant pain with varying severity in the morning and during the day sometimes as well persist after the bloat has mostly subsided. No vomiting, no blood or mucus in stools, no fever and the severity of pain isn't enough to warrant anything above labeled ""high discomfort"" - also have appendix removed as well.

I made a Gastro appt. this morning, but I won't be able to see them for about 3+ weeks unfortunately.

What would be red flags between now and the appointment where I might seek emergency care, if any?

Pain would be also described right sided, and I know my body pretty well so I could definitely feel something is ""off"" and want to make sure I'm taking the proper precautions and not being stubborn if I may need care/imaging/treatment more promptly or if I should just continue to monitor symptoms until the appt.

Thanks in advance.

15b3c4z,">8 mmol/L blood ketones on a 6 day ""water-only"" fast: acidic blood pH?
Hi r/AskDocs ,

I recently did a water fast for its health benefits, my goal was to fast 7 days. I supplemented with all electrolytes and vitamin B1. On day 6 I started having some breathing problems, alternating between slow and deep breathing and shallow breathing. I also had some chest tightness and discomfort, what felt like short-lasting spikes of anxiety and started to feel a bit hot. I felt fine, actually quite energetic other than that. So I checked my BP: 90/55, and my resting heart rate was consistently between 50-60 bpm. Normal values for me even when not fasting (no lightheadedness). Glucose was 49 mg/dL and \*blood\* ketones 7.4 mmol/L, equal to a 0.37 GKI. 2 hours later glucose was 58 and blood ketones above 8 mmol/L (my ketone meter can't measure any higher). Became worried and broke my fast.

No diabetes, kidney disease, or liver disease, generally healthy. Female 23 years old, 180 cm/5'9, around 150 pounds/68kg.

Could my blood pH have started becoming too acidic from the amount of ketones in my blood?

Diabetic ketoacidosis is not the same thing as the metabolic state ketosis though right? DKA is dangerous because of energy toxicity (high blood glucose and ketones + low insulin) and not merely because of the presence of (high) blood ketones?",1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15b3c4z/8_mmoll_blood_ketones_on_a_6_day_wateronly_fast/,23.0,Female,Self

I’ll be honest, I don’t understand much about acid reflux, but to my understanding, it’s typically more of an “acid coming up and leaving a sour taste” thing than a full-on vomiting thing. 

My partner (23M) has had a few random vomiting spells per year as long as I’ve known him, which we never really thought much about, but in the last 2 months, it’s increased in frequency (6 times since May). 

It usually comes late at night, often in the middle of the night or right before bed. It varies from one singular incident to repeated vomiting for hours. 

With the frequency increase in addition to some noticeable unexplained weight loss, he saw a doctor a couple weeks ago. 

The doctor prescribed an acid medication (Pantoprazole?) to take daily and did a CBC as well as a gallbladder area ultrasound. He said the blood tests and ultrasound all looked normal. 

Could it really just be acid reflux? He never really has other acid-related symptoms, and the vomiting is just regular vomiting, although his throat usually burns for a couple days afterward which makes me think it really is extra-acidic. 

He hasn’t had a spell yet since starting the medication— just want to know if we should pursue other paths or lay low until he has an incident while on the meds.

The itchiness starting just hours after my workout, as well as the location of the initial itchiness on my stomach makes me think the two could be connected.

Meds:
- Adderall XR 30 mg 1x/day
- Sertraline 50 mg
- Spironolactone 100mg

In short — I have a lengthy history of gastrointestinal distress and abdominal pain. Originally told to just lose weight, try removing IUD to see if that made a difference (9/2019). Continued to have abdominal (mostly right upper quadrant) pain. 


 From 3/2020 - 8/2020 I lost about 40 pounds without trying. Felt full really quickly, frequent nausea. I wasn’t complaining though, definitely needed to lose some weight. 

After losing the weight and still having pain, primary doc recommended ultrasound and additional testing. Turns out my gallbladder was trash, was scheduled for cholecystectomy two weeks later (9/2020). 

Post gallbladder removal was a process in and of itself, took quite a long time to feel somewhat “normal” again. 

Probably about 6 months post op (spring 2021), I woke up one morning with a new pain in my abdomen. At first it felt like extreme hunger pains, but it quickly intensified and I was on the verge of calling an ambulance. At best I can describe it as extreme cramping/burning that was centralized in my abdomen and radiated to my sternum. The whole episode lasted about 30 minutes.

I had about 3 more of these episodes over the following months. Most other mornings I still had the abdominal pain but it didn’t escalate into these full blown episodes.  I got into a GI specialist and was scheduled for a colonoscopy and endoscopy in spring 2022. Nothing remarkable found during those. 

Frustrated and feeling like I’m just going to continue having this pain. I did have a laparoscopy to r/o endometriosis 2/2023, and had a pedunculate uterine fibroid removed during procedure. Not sure if it’s relevant but I also had a colposcopy in Jan 2022 due to high grade dysplasia, and then a second colposcopy and endometrial biopsy Sep 2022. Last pap Jan 2023 was clear. 

Lately I’ve been having more right upper quadrant pain, sometimes more centralized above my navel. Pain is worse in the mornings but has been intermittent throughout the day.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15b46h7/recurring_abdominal_pain_in_mornings/,30.0,Female,Self

Just some context, I am 25F nonsmoker used to be on the birth control pill for 12 years. Not on any medication but I do have low iron and get transfusions and take supplements.

15b44iz,"Ongoing severe middle-abdominal pain with no obvious cause...
Just to cover the essentials... I'm a 23-year-old, 5'3"", just under 8 stone, UK-based White British female. I have not had an ongoing illness before, I drink and smoke in regular amounts, nothing extreme.

I have been experiencing severe and constant abdominal pain for 12 days. It started in the middle of my abdomen, just under my ribs and about three inches above my navel. The pain is an aching, gnawing, tight feeling which radiates and increases every now and then each day, as though somebody has kicked me very, very hard in the ribs and upper abdomen.

Three days later I had an extreme episode of pain lasting for two hours where my breathing was shallow, I could not be comfortable, and I was crying. I called 111 and the next morning at their recommendation I was seen by paramedics who could not find a cause. I was recommended to see a GP. These intense bouts have continued since, mostly in the evening.

Two days ago I was finally able to see a senior medical practitioner (not my GP) who prescribed mebeverine for IBS. I also had blood taken, stomach palpated, internal vaginal examination and swabs. Nothing was obvious but apparently the pain is referred from lower in my abdomen somewhere above my bladder. I am trying the mebeverine to rule IBS out, but my mother has experienced severe IBS all her life and describes the pain as coming and going dependent on her diet and this affecting her bowel movements. None of these factors apply to me, and the pain is very much 24/7. I am now unable to sleep horizontally and prop myself up at night. I am often unable to stand straight.

I have had no other symptoms apart from pain. Now, 12 days later, the area of the pain has increased.

I have been prescribed co-codamol to manage pain and my blood results need to be talked through, but everything shows as normal on first glance.

I am wondering if anybody knows what it may be? Thank you.

White/Native American male who is 68 y/o. Weight: approx 150-160lbs and approx 5'6/5'7"" in height. Long-time smoker and was a long-time alcoholic. He has been off and on the wagon my whole life but had significantly slowed down his drinking over the past few years.  

He was just diagnosed with Stage IV Prostate Cancer earlier this month. He was told that he would have 39 rounds of radiation and hormone therapy. I don't have more details beyond that the cancer had not yet made it into his bones. But last week, he went into surgery to have an ulcer removed from his stomach. This is when his end-stage liver disease was discovered. It is hard to get updates from my family since they're all mostly in the lower-midwest and southwest, and I (28F) live in PNE. 

This is all very new, so I'm also not trying to stress them out with a bunch of questions. But I wanted to come here and ask if anyone has an idea of how this will progress or what his quality of life will look like in coming future? His doctor said that my grandfather likely cannot carry on with radiation treatment due to the state of his liver. I have heard no mention of dialysis. 

It is hard for me to visit, but I would like to make a trip sooner than later while he's still in good spirits. My problem is that I don't know if I can expect weeks, months, or years.

Hi! Thank you in advance for reading this. I’ve noticed in the last several months that I’ve had a sudden (significant) increase in my gag reflex. Examples are gagging while brushing my teeth (nothing that’s even remotely by the back of my mouth/throat), the smell of food from doing dishes, certain tastes or textures while eating, and even just the other day the smell of my dog’s accident (when it happened in the house, not ever outside). I’m not joking when I say it’s excessive, it sometimes has turned into multiple uncontrollable gags / almost into heaving. Is there anything that might be triggering this, more serious that I should be aware of? It’s starting to bother me and it’s making me anxious to go to the dentist soon (which I’ve never felt before) because I recognize it will likely happen there with how sensitive I am to literally anything recently. I’ve wondered if it might be mental but why did this come out of seemingly nowhere? I’m not on any new medication and I have no risk of being pregnant.

15b3u3r,"Severe Sleepiness in Cramped Situations?
37F, white, 5'9, 180 (muscular). ASD level 1/OCD/Surgical intervention for bad spine. (Let me know if you need more). Med: Luvox, gabapentin (both long term, but my second scenario predates both), new: statin for genetic high cholesterol.  (EDITED TO ADD) I used to suffer migraines, and now seem to occasionally be getting the migraines that don't obviously hurt, but make one nauseated and super sensitive to light. The gabapentin helped with a lot of my original migraine issues, as it helps my neck to relax.

An issue I have had for years has come back to my attention.

I drove cross country (USA) last few days, and even after a decent night's sleep, caffeine (which I usually don't imbibe), AC blasting, MUSIC blasting, window open....about an hour after I start driving, I start falling asleep. And by falling, I mean like I literally cant control my eyes  from going crossed.  Of course this is INCREDIBLY dangerous.

Yes, I know the immediate is ""you are just sleepy"", but this seems.....extreme, and happens after decent sleep and only within the first two hours of driving, even for a ten hour drive. AND, there is another piece. This also used to happen to me at work. First thing in the morning. There was a very formal meeting where I was required to sit at my desk to monitor messages, but a very large crowd would be gathered in the room with me, often directly around my desk. It became a running joke that I would suddenly start falling asleep the instant folks surrounded me. I tried all the same strategies. Got a new cup of coffee, tried cold liquids, tried pinching myself, etc. Yet my head almost hit my keyboard. This was not boring meeting.

Its almost instantaneous, and right when the people dispersed from around my desk, I was fully back to awake. Same with the driving. Right when I get to a rest stop and get out of my car, instantly fully awake.

I was diagnosed with ""Catatonia"" when I received my OCD dx (and the suggestion of ASD, which I rejected at the time as I had a poor understanding of what that could present as in women).  That was about 8 years ago, and during a time of severe stress. It was managed with a couple doses of lorazepam during following occurrences. All contained 8 years ago.

The official ASD dx was in 2022 by a specialist and three psychs.

Is this....incredibly sudden onset sleepiness related to the ASD or something? I am not stressed out, very far from it, so I feel its unrelated to the catatonia responses I had years ago when I was under enormous stress.  It almost feels like its some type of claustrophobia response. Being in a car. Being surrounded by people in a formal setting, etc.

I am an extremely light sleeper, but tend to supplement with naps. This doesn't feel like just falling asleep, it feels like almost being put to sleep.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated, as I love road trips and driving in general. I am looking to find a way to prevent this.

15b77pd,"Extremely scared of pregnancy because of flipped condom with a Thai girl (prostitute)
Hello everyone,

Let me start with saying that my English isn’t that good, so I want to apologise for the grammar mistakes in my post.

So, 10 days ago I had sex with a Thai girl prostitute (yes I know, I’m very stupid and I will not do it again anymore). She gave me a handjob without condom, but the blowjob (oral) and vaginal sex was with condom on. But the reason why I am frightened is because:

When she tried to put the condom on my dick, she first did it on the wrong side (she noticed that the condom didn’t roll further down my penis). When it didn’t roll over my penis, she flipped the condom to the right/good side (so she didn’t use a new condom). I was not thinking much about it on that moment, but now I’m realising that you should throw a condom away when it was put on the wrong side! I’m now really scared she could be pregnant of it. Especially because she told me she didn’t use any other additional form of birth control herself (only the condom).

Before I met with her I had no sex and didn’t jerk off for at least 24 hours (so the previous day). I did pee 1h before I met with her.

I do want to note that I always have quite lots of precum when I get aroused, and I was aroused on my way to her, of course. And of course the handjob let me made lots of precum.

So now I’m scared that she could get pregnant because of the flipped condom, which now some of my precum was on the outside of the condom. 
She did gave me an blowjob (oral sex) with the condom on before we had vaginal sex, so I don’t know if that has any effect? 
So what are the chances? Am I fucked? I’m really scared!

I will of course test my self for any STD just to be sure.

(More info: After one day she deleted her advertise and I could not find any information about her anymore. 

I don’t have her number anymore, because I switched from phones because I got a new phone from my job. Now I have a new number, and that means that I can’t contact her anymore.

She also works completely independently out of her own choice.

15b8mx1,"Odd Paresthesia For a Week
Hi,  
I have been experiencing paresthesia (pins and needles) for about a week. I feel pricks all over my body but mostly in my hands and feet. I scheduled an appointment with my primary care doctor, and he ran a whole slew of blood tests. All came back normal. He referred me to a neurologist. I saw a neurologist last year due migraines (with aura). They did an MRI without contrast and found a very small gliosis on my brain. My understanding is that this is a white matter lesion. The neurologist said this was normal for those who suffer from migraines with aura. She assured me that I would be fine. I started taking magnesium threonate and almost a year and a half later, I haven’t had another migraine with aura. I don’t really have any other neurological symptoms that I am aware of. Sometimes I struggle to find words, but I may have always been like that. No vertigo, nausea, fatigue, weakness, numbness, etc. I am extremely active and pretty healthy. I partake in weight lifting, climbing and running. I eat very healthy and my vitals are all very good.

&#x200B;

  
The reason I am posting here for advice is because of how little information is out there, and almost all the causes of paresthesia seem to be very serious. This has me worried sick. I hate playing the waiting game. I have no idea if I am actively suffering damage to my brain or nerves. I am wondering if there is anyone out there who has been down this path before.  
  
Thanks,

I'm from russia, 157cm (5'2'') tall, my weight is 58kg, I don't drink or smoke, I'm a 17 year old biological female. So this year, at the end of April, I got cystitis and I went to a doctor and they prescribed me with furagin tabletes (50mg, 1 tablet 3 times a day). I took it for a week and it stoped the pain but once I stoped taking the meds the pain returned. I took furagin to stop the pain again for a couple weeks but I went to the doctor again (because it didn't help). The doctor prescribed me with antibiotics, it also didn't help. I thought maybe this means that the issue is not cystitis and maybe doesn't have anything to do with my urinary system at all so I went to a gynecologist, turned out I had vaginitis (I don't know why, I'm a virgin) and they treated that with thichopol tablets (2 tablets per day for a week) and with polygynax (6 capsules, 1 per day), it helped but then I had urethral pain and to this day no doctor could tell me what it was. I took furagin for 3 weeks again (another doctor told me that if I have to take furagin again, I'd have to take 3 per day for a week, then 2 per day for a week, then 1 per day for a week). It didn't help at all so I went to the doctor and got diagnosed with a 31-38mm ovarian cyst and I was in the hospital for 5 days and the cyst shrinked to 20mm. I felt alright for 2-3 days when I was in the hospital but now I pee with blood. Overall, I've never been healthy since 20-28ish of April.

Hello!

As the title says, I have been pricked by a cactus while in Sedona, thought I got all the fragments out. Its been 2 weeks now and my finger is still swollen, hurting a lil around the affected area, and is a tad tight. It’s on my left middle finger between my metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints. 


Is there anything I can do for this or should I be super concerned? My finger can still bend. Its not the worst pain in the world, I figured it would just push itself out. *edit, there seem to be swelling in my larger knuckle and I notice it when my put my fingers straight. Its when it feels the most tight. And the affected area seems to have a small ball of tissue underneath**

15b65or,"Two episodes of sudden severe pain on left side of lower back, TERRIFIED of having a kidney stone.
24M. I don't have a history of kidney stones or any other related issues. I'm not on any medications.

A few days ago I suddenly experienced this severe sharp pain in my middle/lower back, on my left side. It was a really bad stabbing pain, and it hurt every time I breathed. I couldn't take a deep breath or else it REALLY hurt. Thankfully it was over in a couple of minutes. It happened right after I twisted my body in a weird way, so I thought it was maybe just a twisted muscle(even though that felt weird, because I've never had muscle pain manifest as such a stabby pain before) and forgot about it.

Then, last night I had the exact same pain. Severe, stabbing pain on the left side of my lower back. Again, it really hurt to breathe, at one point I took a deep breath and I yelped from the pain. This went away after about 10-15 minutes this time. Weirdly, I think it was squatting that helped. At one point, I tried to lay down, but that made it a lot worse so I immediately got up.

This happened after I had a big meal and a lot of water, and I had been slightly constipated yesterday(and my stomach's been weird lately), so I tried to blame it on being full/constipation/gas, but after thinking about it some more today, I'm really really worried about a kidney stone. It just seems weird that I would have two random episodes of this severe pain I've never felt before. I've been urinating normally, nothing looks weird or anything, but this pain is really strange. I want to ignore it and blame it on something much more benign, but I'm really worried.

15b63cn,"Palliative-like care for someone who is non-terminal?
Female, 38, 190 lbs and 5’4”. Trazodone, Vilazodone, Vyvanse.

I have had SVT and heart palpitations my whole life. Even in childhood, I’ve never been particularly robust, as I tend to run out of breath and get exhausted *very* easily. SVT is triggered by stress, any kind of physical work or activity (sometimes major, sometimes minor). Often an episode is triggered by bending over - weird, but that’s what happens. Working out of any kind is a gamble - sometimes it’ll happen and sometimes it won’t, but at any rate, I can’t exercise or even do mild activity for very long due to the ***extreme*** muscle pain it causes. 

My long muscles feel it worst, but it will extend into my back, shoulders, neck, and abdomen. I consistently wake up with muscle pain, no matter how much I’m sleeping, what position I’m sleeping in, or what kind of mattress. I’ve had two mattresses in two years and it makes no difference for the pain, nor does the amount of water I drink. I can’t even walk half a block down the street at work without needing to take frequent stops. I’ve had my shoes professionally fitted and it makes no difference as regards the pain.

I’ve always been groggy, but right about the time I hit my thirties, I started having horrible brain fog - I can’t even organize my own thoughts or even speak coherently half the time. Sometimes I feel so sleepy during the day that I’ll go to bed super early and sleep for twelve hours and still feel sleepy. The irony is that I can’t sleep at all without the trazodone due to my anxiety, but even when I’m taking the smallest possible amount just to ensure I sleep, I feel like a zombie the next day, despite the number of stimulants I’ve been given over the years - Ritalin, Adderall, Provigil, Nuvigil…. 

Now I’m 38 and feel like someone forty years older. My brain fog, constant sleepiness, heart palpitations, inability to exercise or lose weight, and intense muscle pain are impacting my life so negatively that I just can’t deal with it anymore. I don’t even feel alive, just kind of like a sleepy robot with rusty hinges that squeaks and croaks its way through half-motions. 

I’ve seen so, so many doctors. They all do the same thing:

- Order blood tests. Always a CBC, sometimes lipids, less often basic thyroid function.
- Order a sleep study.
- Twice, a holter monitor. The last one I used was broken but he said it didn’t matter.

All these come back normal, or abnormal “but nothing to worry about”. The sleep studies have just proven that I’m really sleepy and don’t have sleep apnea. 

At that point, every single doctor tells me that there’s nothing more to be done and more than one has recommended I “follow up with my psychiatrist.” I am not exaggerating - these are all the studies I ever get. I don’t know why we even have x-rays, table tilt tests or MRIs, when doctors apparently find everything they need to know using these handful of tests. Over and over again, same tests, same results, normal or abnormal-but-okay, and then nothing again. If I ask for follow-up or further studies I get dismissed because if these tests came back normal, no more are necessary. “Self-advocating” has proven a waste of time, over and over again. It doesn’t make them more concerned, it just seems to piss them off.

Got yet another “Your tests are normal so you must be crazy, it’s your shrink’s job to change your medications” message from another doctor today. Same tests as always. I read back through all of them - all the same old CBCs, lipids, thyroids and sleep studies, over and over again - over time in my online patient portal and I realized that next month is the 10-year anniversary of when I started to seek diagnosis and treatment for this. It has not gotten better in that time. It has only gotten worse. 

At this point, I’m done. This has gone on for long enough and I can’t fight for myself anymore. ***It is because I’m a woman? Hell yes it’s because I’m a woman, but I can’t change that so I am giving up.*** I am tired of waking up every morning in pain, being unable to think, being unable to do all these things that people my own age, and older, around me can do with such ease, being unable to live my life as I should, and having these doctors look at the exact same numbers on a sheet of paper and tell me I’m being hysterical. I haven’t visited my beloved local botanical gardens in years because I can’t even do the walking around there. 

Now, all I want is for this to end. I just want something to make myself comfortable. I want some kind of program or treatment option….how do I describe it. You’re not dying, or at least not dying quickly - you’re not “terminal”, but your quality of life is being so negatively impacted that you don’t have anything else left but to just make things as easy as possible. I’m not trying to seek attention or pity, although I am very angry about everything. But more than anything else, I’m just extremely tired and out of energy to keep tilting at these windmills. (For those who might say “Have you talked to your doctors about POTS/fibromyalgia/etc?.”, yes, I have, but it’s never gone anywhere. One nurse even told me that fibromyalgia is a “fake disease” because there’s no test to determine if someone has it.)

I don’t mean like one of those programs in which you go to a “pain clinic” for dangerous drugs. I just need a program that more acknowledges that I’m out of options and things aren’t going to get better, and can guide me towards making myself comfortable while recognizing that it isn’t going to improve or get treated or cured in a more typical sense. I don’t want any kind of addictive medications or to be put into a stupor. I just don’t quite know how to describe what I’m looking for, but maybe if I post here a medical professional would be able to better name it for me.",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15b63cn/palliativelike_care_for_someone_who_is_nonterminal/,38.0,Female,Self

15b6qej,"Friend (28M) has been in the ICU for 2 weeks - Doctors aren't sure what to do...
My best friend (28, Male, White British), physically fit and active, chronic drinker, history of drug use (cocaine, cannabis, ketamine, MDMA etc.), unvaccinated for Covid, height 6-6.2ft, weight around 75-85kg, being treated in the UK, has been in the ICU for 2 weeks following a cluster of 6 seizures, beginning in his sleep. He last had a seizure around 5 years ago but this did not lead to a diagnosis of anything and he hadn't had any more until now. He was placed in a coma and remains in this state. Initially when they tried to bring him back around, a seizure would follow - I believe he's had around 12 in total at this point. This does not seem to be the case anymore, however he is extremely agitated, enough so that he is pulling out canula's, tubes etc, and so they have kept him back in a coma. I don't think he has opened his eyes the entire time, but did speak a few random sentences (example: 'The president of Nigeria is in a portal').

Since being admitted to hospital his kidneys have also failed, he has pneumonia, and a blood clot on his lung, and there's possibly an issue with his heart following a CT scan this week, although we have no detail on that yet. 

He is currently on dialysis, 100% oxygen, anti-epileptics, ""industrial amounts of sedative"" (quote from the doctor), antibiotics. The doctors are all saying that they've not seen anything like this before in a young patient, and they seem to be lost for a way forward. Brain scans are clear so that's something, although because he's not been really fully conscious since so it's difficult to say if the seizures have had any effect on brain function/memory etc. I believe he's producing around 10-15ml of urine per hour. Yesterday he stopped breathing and we weren't allowed in the room, however he did stabilise in the afternoon and we were allowed back in. He is incredibly swollen from water retention.

It has been suggested that when his muscles have wasted somewhat, that we may be able to restrain him better when he is bought out of the coma . The nurses cant currently hold him down, and will not allow family to assist. They wont use bed restraints because they are worried he will break the restraints or the bed and do further damage). Dude can lift large bits of timber by himself and is very strong.

Doctors are unsure if the kidney problems caused the seizures or vice-versa. His partner told me he has had issue with urination prior to the event however I don't have much more detail there. She also told me that he has problems with temperature regulation in sleep and often she wakes up to him, the sheets and covers, drenched in sweat.

They want to make an incision in his throat to insert a tube to administer drugs this way instead? This was all a bit vague and said we would revisit in a couple of days. 

Other information:

\-He works in Arboriculture   
\-He told me he had been chipping a lot of plant material which gives off hydrogen cyanide?  
\-He rarely, if ever, wears PPE at work  
\-Switched brands of a synthetic/semi-synthetic oil used at work days prior to event  
\-Smoked cannabis in the days leading up to the event, bongs and joints (with tobacco)   
\-There's a chance he could have used cocaine in the weeks before the event, although most likely a month ago or more   
\-He does not take any prescription medication  
\-We estimate he drank around 8 pints per day, also sometimes drank wine on a evening or a gin & tonic  
\-He inconsistently smokes cigarettes. Maybe 3-5 on the days that he does. (2-3 days a week)  
\-Probably doesn't drink enough water  
\-used to consume  many energy drinks  
\-has issues with anger - can get very pissed off, very easily, depending on his mood, worse when driving or at work, possibly high blood pressure?   
\-has been in contact with/possibly scratched by a stray cat and her kittens

Each day seems to bring not so good news, and I'm growing rather concerned. I'm in the UK and my friend is being treated under the NHS - The hospitals he has been in so far both are rated 'inadequate' or 'requires improvement' for most services, which doesn't fill me with confidence.   

Now I'm a cup half full kind of guy, but I'm also a realist and am prepared to hear all potential prognosis - I'm looking for any advice as to what the coming weeks may bring, ideally best and worse case scenarios - Any insight into what may be causing his problems,  good  potential courses of action regarding treatment etc, potential outlooks both good and bad, are all appreciated so I can be prepared for whatever comes next and be ready to support the family through this.

I come here to ask because I feel like I have a couple more episodes, I will die. The tests I was ordered by my PCP are for the 31st and won't get any results till August 16. My PCP ordered my thyroid and pancreas checked.

Background

I live in Japan and the system here is very different from the US. If you go to the ER at night, they will only stabilize you and won't run any additonal tests.

On July 18 at 7pm while at work I felt as if someone had hit me in the head. Dizzy. Soon after, I had the following symptoms:

1. Numbness and needle feeling in all body.
2. Pale skin
3. Tachycardia (80~140)
4. Extremely low blood pressure (both)
5. Fatigue and muscle weakness
6 Confusion
7. Polyuria
8. Dry mouth
9. Difficulty speaking and swallowing 
10. Shaking body with little control
11. Chest pain

I went to the hospital and stayed there for about 3 hours. After peeing about 5 times, I felt like nothing have happened.


Progression

I feel dizzy every day. Every time I eat or movr, the dizziness gets worse to the point where the above symptoms appear and I have to run to the hospital. The symptoms tend to appear more frequently if I eat salty foods. They also get worse as the day progresses, and come in waves of varying strengths. I'm scared of eating now.


I decided to check my glucose and bloood pressure for an entire day with a device. My glucose in the morning was 64. It would quickly change if I moved or ate but then would drop back to the 70s range. It changed every 15-30 mins or so, oscillating between 70 - 110 throughout the day.

I also decided to check my blood pressure during the day. It was higher than 120/70 at all times, peaking at 135/88 on a day where I didnt get all the symptoms, but still felt dizzier than normal.

Here is where it gets weird. I have varying at rest blood pressure during the day, but the diastolic tends to change the most. When the symptoms start to appear, my blood pressure is usually at 160/100+ and my glucose became unreadable by the sensor ( when I had it on). After a couple hrs, the symptoms go away and I'll have a blood pressure as low as 70/50 and normal glucose levels.


I want to visit a place where I can get checked up quickly, as I fear that a couple more of these will kill me. I have already been to the ER 4 times in 10 days because of this. For this, I will be traveling away from my small town and into Tokyo tomorrow.

This got removed for not providing enough info so: 
31, female, smoker, medications: Wellbutrin and lamictal, some symptoms have only shown up in the past weeks others have been longer and each is noted in the description, 5’8 180 lbs, no medical conditions diagnosed in the past but history of colon/breast cancer in family



I’ve been experiencing multiple symptoms and always looked into them individually, but I recently saw that many could be symptoms of a brain tumor. I’ve never had an MRI or any kind of test and some of the symptoms have been there longer, some have only shown up in the last few weeks. The symptoms include:
-memory loss. I’ve always had bad long term memory but recently I am forgetting a lot more. If someone asks me what I did a few days ago it takes me a while to recall, sometimes I need the help of photos/text messages/looking at my work schedule to remember.
-irritability and behavior changes. I have dealt with irritability in the past here and there but it has been much more intense recently. I cry often and don’t know why. It generally last a few minutes and then my mood is fine again. I’m having a difficult time with impulsivity in terms of spending money and lashing out at loved ones. 
-within the past 2/3 weeks I have been incredibly tired. Every day. I won’t be tired all day but about three or four times a day I get hit with this sudden feeling of not being able to keep my eyes open and fall asleep very quickly despite not being in bed. Low energy has been an issue for me for a while but never sudden onset intense fatigue. 
-ice pick/tension headaches. These have been a thing for quite a while. They are not daily but seem to come in spurts. The ice pick headaches are always in the front of my head/near my temples. 
-vision has been blurry here and there. Again not all the time and more often at night. 
-hearing loss, not sudden but worse recently. This one could be explained by going to a lot of shows in the past but I constantly have to ask people to repeat themselves. 
-nausea. At least once a day and doesn’t usually last long. 

If anyone has any insight on this please let me know! I’m going to the doctor ASAP but my work schedule is making it difficult to find a time for an appointment and I tend to think I’m overreacting.

37, M, 5'8"", 170 pounds, caucasian  


Several years back, I noticed a large growth on my left testicle. My GP at the time ordered an ultrasound and then said it was benign but to keep an eye on it.  


About a month or so ago, I had some pain and noticed the left testicle seemed larger and the growth seemed larger. It worried me pretty badly, but unfortunately, I had just changed jobs and benefits had not kicked in, so the earliest I could set an appointment is next month to be insured for the visit. My former GP has moved states and I have to re-establish at a new practice.

Fast forward and recently the left testicle has actually decreased in size and the growth has dramatically decreased in size and feels less substantial. 

NOW it seems that on top of that, the right testicle is slightly larger and feels a bit harder.  


I do have an appointment with a new physician next month but am just wondering if this is cause for more immediate concern and if I should, ya know, forget about insurance for now and just get seen asap.

Last week I was hiking/camping in a National Park, I slipped on a rock and slammed my shin into it. It hurt pretty bad, but I was able to finish the hike (probably half a mile to a full mile max) without any issues. On the drive back to camp I noticed it was swelling quite a bit. As soon as I got back to camp I cleaned the wound, put a bandaid on it, elevated my leg above my heart and starting icing it. I also wrapped it putting some compression on the area. When getting up and walking around I never experienced more pain than what I was already in and I took a couple advil over the next 24-48 hours to help with the pain. The swelling went down quite a bit after 24 hours and the pain also got less and less over time (but definitely spiked about 12 hours after the injury). I flew back home on Saturday and started seeing a lot of bruising all down my leg around the wounded area down to my ankle, the bruising seems to increase where more pressure is applied from my socks (more bruising around the ankle when I wear ankle socks, more bruising on the shin when I wear higher socks) the wounded area is still a bit swollen and I will get some pain here and there, especially if I stand for an extended amount of time (3+ hours) and I am continuing to ice and elevate it when I can, I also started adding compression to it.

No family history of cardiovascular disease

Pretty balanced diet, non smoker, usually drinking no more than 5 units a week

In summary, around March/April I discovered that I had slight hypertension (140/90), which was bit of a surprise. I visited GP to get consultation and they advised to try and exercise more since there wasn’t much of a lifestyle modifications I could do. 

I was told to measure my BP 2x a day for a week, during which I discovered that my BP varied quite a bit (130/85 in the mornings but up to 150/95 in evenings). There were mornings where my BP would fall in healthy range but was always elevated from afternoon onwards. 

At the time I was taking combined pill as birth control but I decided to stop it due to elevated hypertension (on no birth control currently). Since then I had two major episodes of anxiety (healthy anxiety related) but it is well managed now.

I have severe, difficult to treat menstrual migraine.

In the past, I have very successfully aborted a migraine with Plan B after my 1st through 6th line abortives did nothing (Toradol, Tylenol, Triptans, DHE, NS ketamine, Olanzapine, Nurtec, baclofen, Benadryl, IV Depakote, IV magnesium, oral steroids, and probably more I’m not thinking of).

History: 
Stills Disease (in remission currently)
Chronic bilateral Dvts of fem veins
May Thurner syndrome (4 venous stents placed, left and right external iliac and left and right common iliac)
Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome although vascular has been considered but i don’t have an extra cervical rib or any injury in the chest
Gastroparesis & esophagus dysmotility& GERD
PSVT & POTS
Factor 5 Leiden
Chronic venous insufficiency 
Intersistial cystitis
Benign hyper mobility spectrum disorder (not eds)


Tests:
Abnormal vng but ears were normal, nystagmus is central/brain related
I did have oligoclonal bands in blood test, igg lambda was the biggest but they’re “small” the blood work for the numbers were all normal 
Brain MRI normal 
Plenty others just ask for more info
Connective tissue panel from invitae genetic test normal, also normal vascular genetic conditions i think maybe like 10 were tested 


Meds: 
Metoprolol 25 mg daily, sometimes twice a day
Esomeprazole 40 mg twice a day
Adderall 20 mg twice a day
Xarelto 20 mg daily
Norethindrone 5 mg daily
Myrbetriq forgot my dose i just started this one
Actemra (Tocilizumab) infusions 480 mL or whatever the measurement is in solution. Once a month. Last 3 times have had a bad reaction but before that was fine, this is for my stills started back in early 2021 i believe.


So I have a main question, and if you need more details for more context please let me know and I will respond. 


What could possibly cause “hardening” all over your body, literally all over, from your skull to your toes? I’ve noticed since my illness started prominence in certain areas of my body I initially ignored but started growing harder/increasing in prominence, and as that happens, it is positively correlated with the worsening of my symptoms that are very much compression related and most of the time by position or exertion. As time goes by, the symptoms get worse and get triggered much easier limiting my quality of life and ability to do anything at all at this point. 

Every time I point out an area to different doctors they say “that’s your cartilage” or “that’s your bone” so I assume the hardening is happening primarily or solely in areas where there is cartilage/bone but I’m no doctor and don’t have a full scope of a humans anatomy. 
The hardening growth is not significant like a tumor can be, but palpable enough to feel the difference, but easy to assume maybe I was always like that if you weren’t in my own body. Lately in certain areas the prominence is more significant where I don’t have to prove myself as much. No it’s not because I lost weight. 

The reason I am so confused about this is because a lot of doctors brought up scleroderma to me. But my rheumatologist and a few other rheumatologist I’ve seen ruled that out. My skin is not affected. I’ve had scans on certain areas that don’t reveal what the fuck it is. That is the frustrating part. 

Recent appointments with 2 of my doctors have suggested bone growth because of the increasing prominence and thickness, aka hyperostosis, however, they aren’t saying it’s likely because that would have shown on scans no doubt. I know I don’t have a tumor/cancer thankfully. But what could possibly systemically grow/deposit in cartilage/bone all over the body but not be seen on scans? If it’s not fibrosis or bone growth, what could it be?

Knee MRI did not reveal what the hardening was it’s in the medial knee btw, it only revealed the damage it caused (minor things like bursa small joint effusion etc. that happened in other areas caused by the hardening). My ortho doc noticed the joint in my inner knee only increasing so he did an ultrasound himself. He said he saw small deposits that looked to be calcifications on my cartilage but my knee X-ray did not show this and he said that it wouldn’t be the cause for the significant hardening anyway. It wouldn’t cause my inner knee to look like that and grow so much, it’s starting to wrap around to the back of my knee causing even more instability. It’s only happening more and more everywhere, sometimes when it’s happening on the palm of my hands, I get an extreme itch that feels like a nerve. And then when I close my palm it starts burning. I feel like these type of symptoms occur as more hardening develops because soon after I notice the increased prominence. Or if I’m just compressing the hardened area too much. Like typing on my phone lol. My chest is getting harder and thicker as well. I have more info but it’s too much to type, including how my head presented when the bone increased. It’s by my temporal bones in head by the way, almost every part of my body that is hard is bilateral, left and right. Just like my May Thurners. They said they saw my bone compressing the iliac artery but apparently the bone isn’t supposed to be near there?! And usually May Thurner is only left side. My left is usually worse than my right. 

Please please tell me what could be causing this because my life has changed so much. I stopped working last year and now I can barely get out of bed without feeling like I’m going to pass out. I don’t want to go into any more apts unless there is an actual reason to test for something that makes sense. I’m tired of random tests and the docs having no sense of what’s going on. If there’s something that reasonably makes sense let me know.

Is there a special scan for whatever it could be? I’ve even had a nuclear bone scan for my whole body that was normal. 

Is something like amyloidosis possible? I noticed my tongue got bigger (not a lump but just larger in size) which caused permanent bite marks around tongue but I showed an ENT who didn’t think anything of it. Would amyloidosis show on scans? Something similar? Does the oligoclonal band, which I know can mean anything, point to a specific condition that could cause this? It’s not inflammatory related because I’m still on actemra and my inflammation markers are all normal. The results for my oligoclonal bands from pathologist say to do a “bence jones” pee test if my symptoms relate which i didn’t know what he was referring to but doc said it wasn’t necessary because he said that’s for myeloma. Since I didn’t have a mono band I was cleared of that thankfully but if you want the exact results let me know. Everything was normal number wise in that test besides the pathologist notes of the OB. Also my calcium and alk phosphate are normal. They have both been low before when tested at sensitive times but are usually normal. 

If you take the time to read this, thank you. Again let me know if you need more info, have specific questions or want to see specific test results yourself.",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15ba9uv/my_mystery_illness_is_getting_worse_please_help/,,Female,Self

28F, non-smoker 
Hello, doctors of Reddit. Please, can you explain the findings of my brain and thoracic spine MRI? I was referred by a neurologist, and an EMG was performed, which showed several moderately severe impairments. Following that, the brain and thoracic spine MRI were conducted as described below. Thank you all for your help.

Brain MRI was performed using a native, standard protocol.
There are no significant pathological changes infratentorially.
The cerebellum shows a normal signal without focal lesions.
The fourth ventricle is centrally located and slightly larger for the patient's age.
Basal cisterns are preserved.
Supratentorially, there are no signs of acute ischemia, hemorrhage, expansive lesions, extra-axial collections, or demyelinating lesions.
T2-hyperintense zones are visible adjacent to the lateral ventricles' horns.
The brain ventricles are of normal position and size.
The midline is preserved.
Paranasal sinuses show normal air-filled spaces.
Thoracic spine MRI was performed using a native, standard protocol.
Thoracic kyphosis is maintained.
The bony spinal canal is of normal width, with no pathological content.
Vertebral bodies have normal heights and signals.
Intervertebral discs have heights within the normal range.
There are no signs of radicular or medullary compression.
The spinal cord shows normal morphology and signal. Please note a slight widening (up to 2 mm) of the central medullary canal at the Th6 to Th8 levels, which is within the normal range.
Conclusion:
Slightly larger fourth ventricle for the patient's age and chronic white matter lesions adjacent to the lateral ventricles' horns. The thoracic spine is within normal limits.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15b9qhp/brain_and_thoracic_spine_mri/,28.0,Female,Self

I \[27m\] recently experienced pain in my right shoulder while playing tennis and went to see an orthopedist. After an MRI of my shoulder I went to two orthopedists for their opinions. It's pretty clear there is an issiu with my labrum (SLAP) but one doctor said I should get surgery while the other said surgery was unnecessary. I attached the MRI pictures the doctors showed me. If onother angle(not sure this is the correct term) is necessary I will upload more pictures.

I am pretty stressed out but have dealt with this for years, and struggle with anxiety and trouble sleeping, take trazadone 50mg for sleep. Diagnosed with dry eyes (taking Cequa). Struggle with alternating constipation and occasional diarrhea (possibly IBD). Was taking Nutrafol (multivitamin for weak/thin hair and nails, includes D3, biotin), Tuna oil for omega-3, food sourced multivitamin by Standard Process that had low levels of B6, B12.

Starting about 3 months ago I had severe parethesia throughout my body, bilaterally, including in face, tongue. After a few days it subsided in intensity but I have felt it on and off throughout my body, mostly in extremities since then. No stumbling, weakness. I've been able to exercise/run normally. I do feel more fatigued/brain fog certain days.

About a month after these symptoms started, I got COVID for the first time, so don't think this was related to COVID.  Vaccinated over a year ago.

I went to a neurologist about a month ago to help with this and also with migraines that I was originally being treated for just by my PCP. I don't get migraines frequently, maybe once a month, skip a few months. Some intense migraines last several days.  I was prescribed Ubrelvy 100 mg daily. Previously tried Nurtec, Fiorcet, Propranolol, sumatriptan.

Neurologist did basic motor function tests, did not seem to have muscle weakness so she thinks not likely MS.  Peripheral nerve damage test with tuning fork maybe indicated some peripheral neuropathy, I am going back soon for EMG. MRI with contrast did show some white matter hyperintensities, that they believe are from the migraines and not correlated with the paresthesia.

My question is, if this is not deemed MS, and paresthesia is ""not from migraines"", what could it be from? Anything I should specifically ask next time I see neurologist? Second opinions?

Lab tests were positive for:

\-Allergen Gluten high (15.3 mcg/ml) ...I have now been gluten free for a couple weeks

\-ANA Titer positive with 1:40 titer (I've read this can be normal at this low level titer?)

\-Vitamin D, 25-OH total: 51. They said this was low-normal. Was told to take D3 supplements and add K2. The recommended D3 dose I was already getting in Nutrafol, but I have switched to their recommended supplement.

\-Ferritin low: 11 ng/ml.  I am taking a supplement now. Iron and binding capacity tests were normal, Hct 44.

\-B6 plasma high (47.5 ng/ml). I have stopped all supplements I was taking, esp the Standard process that had B6 (only 59% of DV) and any sports drinks that have added B6. She said high B6 can cause these symptoms.

15bccra,"I’m pregnant and pretty sure I experienced heat exhaustion last night, but I’m feeling better today. Should I be worried?
I’m a 26 year old caucasian female, with no pre-existing conditions besides asthma. I do not smoke, drink, or take medications (besides daily prenatals). I’m currently 9w+4d pregnant with my husband and I’s first.

My husband and I went to a concert last night at an outdoor venue. When we arrived, the temperature was at it’s high of 88°F, and by the time we left it was 78°F. We were outside for around 3.5 hours in total. 

I felt fine throughout the whole concert. I wasn’t even sweating- I was genuinely comfortable, though admittedly people around me (husband included) kept complaining about the heat. Regardless, I sipped on water and Gatorade throughout the night to be safe. 

Right as we were leaving, I began to develop a headache behind my right eye. It was a 3-4 on a 10-is-the-worst pain scale, so it was annoying more than anything. I continued drinking water and Gatorade but I couldn’t shake it, so I took half of a Tylenol and had a few sips of a Vanilla Coke.

30 minutes later, my headache was gone and was replaced with nausea. Another 30 minutes later when we pulled into our driveway, I felt “out of it”/lightheaded and puked twice immediately in our yard. We ran inside and I puked about 4-5 more times.  My headache came back, and I chose to just go to bed.

I woke up today feeling way better. I was hungry and thirsty, so I ate and drank water with no problems. But there was no more headache, nausea, or anything- I generally felt (and still feel) great. 

Last night I didn’t think too much of it as I was just miserable, but in hindsight I’m worried I was experiencing some type of heat sickness or exhaustion. Like I said, I still feel great and I have no symptoms of anything being wrong. But as a first-time mom, I’m concerned. 

So my questions are:

1) Should I go to the ER anyways?

2) Are there any particular symptoms I should be on the lookout for in the next few days?

3) Could this have theoretically (I know we can’t diagnose) harmed my baby?

From what I’ve read online, everything says it could have been worse and I’ll be fine. But we all know how online information is. I called a friend who is an RN, but I don’t think I explained everything clearly to her as she couldn’t give me answers to these questions. She recommended going to the ER if I felt concerned, however I know doctor’s time (especially in emergency situations) is incredibly important and I can’t seem to justify going while feeling perfectly fine, just to alleviate concerns.

So any insight is appreciated! Thank you all for your time!",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15bccra/im_pregnant_and_pretty_sure_i_experienced_heat/,26.0,Female,Self

15bctor,"I (M,25) had a femoral osteotomy done at age 5 to correct my Legg Calve Perthes disease. Is it normal for your hip to consistently ""pop"" after all those years when you rotate it?
I understand the general answer is to get an opinion from your physician, but I am just here out of curiousity:

I'm a 25 y/o caucasian male, 5'-9"" tall and roughly around 185-190 pounds, with Legg Calve Perthes disease. I drink rarely, and I don't take any medications or smoke, or do drugs. At age 5, I've had a femoral osteotomy done to permanently rotate my right hip and fuse the bone back together with hardware at a different angle, and placed into a body cast for the whole summer to heal. 20 years later, I very RARELY ever feel pain in my hip, but I've always had a consistent ""pop"" when I move my hip in a circular motion. 

I live a very normal life, and I can and do run, and do everything everyone else does, but my range of motion in my hip is vastly limited. criss-crossing is sometimes painful, when I sit I feel my hip bone sort of poke out through my right glute (although I experience no pain), and I work in nuclear, where I always have to dress in protective wear that requires me to bend over and put rubber boots on my foot since I can't cross my right leg over the left to make it easier on me to put protective garments on. To come to think of it, I don't even remember ever crossing my right leg over my left for as long as I can remember. Besides the lack of motion in certain areas, I maintain a very normal life, and I can go up stairs and run as I please. I don't suffer from any pain, unless it is a very rare circumstance where I could have pulled a muscle, or got a bubble in my hip that pops (the pain hits hard and quick sometimes, but subsides almost immediately and I am no longer feeling pain within 15 seconds).

This may be a stretch, but is there anyone else on here who has Legg Calve Perthes disease like me, who had a femoral osteotomy done, and experience(d) similar daily life complications and interesting outcomes as well, and is it normal for my hip to essentially ""pop"" every time I rotate it?

15bgs4r,"Penis problems: possible penile suspensory ligament injury? Asking for advice.
About 3 weeks ago I (27M) noticed some issues with my penis and testicles. I can't remember exactly when I first noticed the issue but I'm 99% sure it was right after I slept on my stomach for about 1.5 hours (which I will never be doing ever again). 

&#x200B;

I first noticed this issue because of I constantly felt the need to adjust my testicles but I couldn't get them to feel right. When this first occurred, my whole public area did not feel right. I noticed that the fat pad around my penis felt loose and sloppy. My right testicle is much lower than my left. My penis is angled to the right and is slightly rotated to the right or clockwise from my perspective. My penis has also retreated slightly into my body. I can get erections but they are weak, unstable, and happen much less frequently (1-2 times per day with injury vs 3-5+ per day usually). The erection does not get as high or go up as normal, and it doesn't feel solidly attached at the base. I also seemingly cannot move/wiggle my penis up/down as you would, for example, when you squeeze your abdomen to ""close off"" at the end of a pee. Seemingly related to this is a general pressure or a feeling that some of my lower abdomen or pelvic muscles are tensed up. This feeling reminds of a feeling tenseness that sometimes (rarely) occurs due coughing bouts or hearty laughing. At first I did not notice any sort of pain, but since then I've noticed 1 or perhaps 2 areas where there is light pressure or slight pain. When the area is agitated (usually from sitting for a long period), I can feel a slight pressure, seemingly behind my right testicle or the right side of my penis (in the pelvic area) area but its hard to tell. Slightly above that I can feel a slight pressure/pain/tenderness in my lower abdomen, specifically when I bend over at the waist. I sometimes (fairly rarely) get similar feelings to this second pain when I overeat coupled with coughing. When this injury first occurred, it also felt like I needed to pee urgently, but when I went to the bathroom, not much would come out. I also often felt like I was ""leaking"" after every trip to the bathroom, but ironically I seemingly have had less problems with dribble since my injury. It seems that standing is the best way to avoid discomfort on the area.

&#x200B;

To be clear, some improvements have occurred over the last 3 weeks. My testicles and pubic area have regained most of their structure and there is less discomfort/feelings of weirdness/feeling the need to adjust things. I no longer feel like the fat pad around my penis is sagging or ""sloppy."" My right testicle is not a low compared to the left as before, though it sometimes returns to that altered state if the area has been agitated (again, sitting for long periods of time). My penis is less turtled than before, but again, will retreat somewhat upon agitation. While some stuff has gotten better, the pressure in my lower abdomen and pubic area has become more noticeable.

&#x200B;

While there has been some improvements, all of said improvements happened in the first few days after the injury, and my condition has remained mostly unchanged since then. From what I've read, the most likely cause is some sort of injury to the penile suspensory ligament, but I'm not sure. Because I have no real pain, I assume that it is an injury that will not require medical intervention, however I did read one case study where someone had a full ligament rupture without any pain. I know ligament injuries take a long time to heal, however it is concerning to me that I have seemingly not had any improvement in my little guy's condition in 2 weeks. I want my penis to work again, lol. For what its worth, I poked/pressed my fingers into various soft parts of my pubic area to feel around inside and didn't notice and pain or abnormalities, not that I know what I'm looking for.

&#x200B;

I want to seek your advice before I got to a doctor. I'm worried I'll have to cough up $300 only to be given an anti-inflammatory and told to rest for 4 weeks. Basically, what likely is the cause of this issue and what is my best course of action?

15b9y3f,"Arachnoid cyst CT report
Hello, 
I was born with an arachnoid cyst and recently had a follow up CT scan. I am 24 weeks pregnant and being referred to endoscopic neurosurgery - I am wondering if this is just for monitoring or due to perhaps needing surgery? 

Husband is active duty and scheduled to leave for a while - he is wondering if he should request time off work to accompany me to my appointment. I don’t want to worry him, but with the unpredictability of his schedule, he needs to put in a request as soon as possible. He doesn’t typically come with me to my appointments, but after being told from my OB I am high risk, he is quite concerned.

Could anyone look over my report and offer recommendations? I feel okay, sometimes dizzy, and often have headaches which I have been told can be attributed to barometric pressure changes - but otherwise I feel “normal”.

Pasted below is the radiology report for my brain CT scan WO contrast:

Impression
1. Stable position of right posterior approach ventriculostomy catheter. The third and lateral ventricles are slightly less narrow compared to 06/10/2022 CT. 
2. No acute infarct or hemorrhage. 
3. Two cystic lesions in the right lateral ventricle are similar to slightly smaller compared to 2022 study. 
4. 7 mm leftward midline shift, previously measured 6 mm.  

COMPARISON: CT 06/10/2022, brain MRI 07/31/2015  

TECHNIQUE: Multiaxial CT images were obtained from the foramen magnum to the vertex.

The catheter position is comparable to the 06/10/2022 CT.  The third and lateral ventricles are slightly less narrow compared to the prior CT. No ventricular dilatation.  An ovoid cyst is seen in the atrium of the right lateral ventricle, measuring 2.5 x 1.8 cm, similar to prior.

15b8ur3,"I think my friend is planning to hurt me and/or a girl that rejected him. I’d like your input on what to do.
I have this friend, I’ll just use his first letter, R, who I believe has been stalking me for the past 2 weeks if not longer.

I’ll give some background info then get into the problem I’m in. 
Thanks in advance for any advice and help .

We met back in 2014 in high school. He was always a quiet but nice and easy going guy. We grew very close and I saw him as a brother. He didn’t have a very smooth childhood, he saw his parents argue a lot, often for years, his mom even cheated on his dad and he saw the effect it had on him and the whole family. But you wouldn’t suspect anything out of the ordinary just meeting him at first.

Around 2016 he started to become a bit paranoid and would seem a bit pessimistic at times. He never had many friends, neither did I for that matter, we had two other friends together that we saw often, and we were the only ones he trusted.

I saw him have this strange panic attack where he ran out of a restaurant we were at and he ran to a nearby park and yelled at people. I called his dad to come get him and he got him in the car and gave him a pill. Apparently this has been the second time this happened recently then.

Fast forward to June 2021. In between that last episode/attack to now R seemed normal as could be, but I noticed he was a bit off and has been since then. He met a girl in college months before that he says he fell madly in love with but she rejected him when he asked her on a date and blocked him on everything right after graduation. It took a massive toll on his emotional and mental state. He had another episode where he ran outside his house and actually provoked someone and they punched him in self defense and then his parents took him to the hospital during that summer and was officially diagnosed with schizophrenia. 

So, from late 2021 until now I’ve noticed he’s quieter, still cracks jokes and can have a decent conversation with him and still seems like a nice guy, but there’s some stuff recently that I truly think is alarming and this is why I’m making this post.

So, I’ll cut to the chase. For the last 6 weeks we’ve hung out 3 times. This was actually after a hiatus where we didn’t see each other since February this year because I started working more hours and went to night shift. Each of those 3 hangouts I’ve noticed he looks at me in a really strange way, like he’s horny and imagining me naked or imagining himself hurting me (we’re both male, heterosexual. Saying this to preface for what I’ll mention in a bit). He also mentions how he’s still in love with that girl from school but proceeds to call her a slut, whore, and wants to rape and kill her right after. He has said this numerous times and even mentions going to the elementary school she goes to. He sent me a picture of that school on google maps with arrows pointed at it and firework emojis last week. He also admitted to having parked outside her home and sitting there for hours about 5 times back in 2021.

For the past week he has been insisting on hanging out several times a day and when I was at chilis with my parents on Saturday he sent me a message saying “chilis”. He’s able to see me since I’m on the snap map on Snapchat since I use the app often to talk to other friends. When I went to the mall right after he said “you’re going to the mall again, you were there yesterday”. Which is true, I went to the mall twice once with mom and then with both my parents the day later to get some stuff since one of our favorite stores was closing so we wanted to check out good deals. On the drive home that day he messaged me saying “you didn’t work today, we should have hung out”. I replied “maybe Wednesday” (which was yesterday, and I didn’t see him because I’m genuinely creeped out). So, the day after , on Sunday he again insisted on seeing me but I went to go play soccer instead with other friends and then went to go do laundry afterwards and when I was at the laundromat he sent me a soccer ball emoji and a laundry emoji indicating he saw me on the snap map .

Here’s the thing, he keeps mentioning where I am and it’s always within 10 minutes of me being on my phone. He’s actually done this for the last 2 years but never this frequently , it used to be like twice a month and I brushed it off but now I’m noticing something actually concerning. 

He has also been calling me “boyfriend” and sending heart emojis the past week and when I told him I might see him this week (which I won’t but I said so just to not make him mad because I’m actually fearful of him hurting me or others) he said “you think I can wait that long to see my boyfriend? This past Sunday I didn’t reply to him for 4 hours and he kept asking if I’m mad and then said he wants me to reply no longer than a minute after he texts me each time. I have the feeling he’s just constantly on his phone looking for when I’m active on social media and I really don’t know why. He also admitted to me a month ago that he makes fake profiles to be able to gain access to that one girl’s Instagram and look at her pictures and he says he masturbates to them. He even uses the nudity apps to take her clothes off he said.

All of this is concerning. He currently doesn’t have a job and hasn’t had one for the last two years, I’m the only friend he sees and talks to, and I feel he’s developed a compulsion or fixation or dependence or mix of all 3 on me, and as I mentioned he has said he wants to rape and kill the girl that used to be in his class and he knows where she lives and he knows where she works. I have not mentioned my thoughts on this to him again out of fear.

He currently takes Risperidone daily and he said he’s been seeing a new therapist for just a month now but I don’t know if any of those are even working.

I am asking for any advice on how to approach this and what to do . My concern is that if I tell anyone like the police or the girl he will find out and retaliate by hurting me or my family as he knows where I live .

Any help is appreciated. 

Also if any of you think it’s best to actually delete this in case he sees it let me know as I know he has had Reddit before but I am using a brand new account.

Since February 2022, I have been having excessive, viscous, dark green post nasal discharge. I'm constantly snorting to clear the back of my nose and when I do, I cough out these huge dark green, dried chunks of mucus. These chunks appear as though they were adhered to the walls of my sinus/nasal passage somewhere - most are concave shaped like a contact lens. Neti pot helps get these chunks out and usually i get a few hours of relief before i start to feel thick mucus dripping down the back of my nose/throat again. Of note, the neti pot flows well out of my left nostril but meets significant resistance coming out of my right nostril (leading me to believe there is a narrowing somewhere in the back of my nasal passages that is causing mucus to stagnate). In December 2022, I was prescribed 10 days of clindamycin 500mg BID and fluticasone. Issue did not go away with abx and afterwards i was given a medrol dose pack which did not provide relief either. Earlier this month, I got a CT of my sinus and the only notable findings from the radiologist report were as follows: rightward nasal septal deviation causing slight narrowing of the right nasal passage, small Haller cells seen bilaterally however not causing any significant narrowing of the maxillary infundibulum. Everything else was said to be normal. My provider placed me on 3 weeks of clindamycin 500mg BID, a 21 day prednisone taper and told me continue w/ the fluticasone. 

&#x200B;

I'm about a week into the antibiotics and have not noticed any improvement in my symptoms. I'm miserable. Constantly gagging on mucus and having to excuse myself to cough out these foul smelling boogers in the bathroom. I can feel these boogers start to come down my throat when im talking, eating, driving, etc. and im terrified of one flying out of my mouth during conversation or accidentally aspirating on one. The CT noted only minor anatomical anomalies and my provider has not suggested any alternative diagnoses. I've tried my best to convey my discomfort to my provider but nothing seems to trigger any sense of urgency and I feel shit out of luck.

&#x200B;

Are there any ENT people out there that have seen or heard of something like this before? I'll attach a link to pictures of the CT and samples of the boogers described.

Hello, I am 27F, biracial. All my life, I had never had an issue being in the heat. I loved going to the pool during the summers, and my family would stay ALL day. Even on vacations, we would spend 6-8 hours on the beach. I had only ever gotten sunburned a bit on my shoulders, but it has only happened about 3x in my life. A couple years ago, I attended an annual music festival with some friends and my SO, where I suffered from a (boarderline) heat stroke. Everything started going white, I felt nauseous,  could barely stand, and my SO had to drag me through a crowd until I just couldn't stand anymore. By the time I laid down, my vision had become completely white and I couldn't see for a bit. I was ghost pale (according to friends and SO), my skin was very clammy, and I felt so cold I was shivering. My SO was able to take care of me by keeping me awake, and cooling me down (but not too fast). He offered getting me medical attention, but I adamantly refused. I didn't want to pay for a hospital bill or an ambulance ride if it came to that.  Once I felt confident enough to stand and go to the bathroom, a nice lady came by and gave us some Pedialyte and I got to feeling better after a long while.  Since that time, I have noticed that I am much more susceptible to the heat. We attended a concert recently and even after the sun went down and I was fanning off the entire time. I was still sweating. We had to leave early because I did not feel well--and this was a concert I have been wanting to go to for over 15 years. I hate this. I really love being outdoors, taking hikes, being at festivals, etc. I hate that I've had to limit myself as well as my partner since this time.

As soon as my role at work was changed my anxiety, panic and low moods were gone.

Hello! I am a 20 year old MALE located in SEA (Philippines). No medications and all. I feel scared and anxious since about a month ago, I figured I'd ask here for your insights.

Around 5 months and a few days ago, I accidentally stepped on a kitten. It startled the kitten although I was able to lift my foot when I noticed. It also acted normally when I did lift, it just walked around and stayed close. When my foot met the kitten, I felt its nails on the foot, I was wearing some flip flops, I only felt it on the sides of my foot. 

At first I thought nothing of it. I made sure to cover my foot with some alcohol (bad practice) to make sure I did not get any scratches nor wounds from the incident and I did not notice any visible marks or scratches.

In addition, I had a healed wound at the top of my big toe. Which was I'd say fully healed. When I did put the alcohol over my foot, I did not feel any pain or sting on the location.

A few days later after the incident around 9-12, another stray kitten died although due to unknown reasons. I could not verify if it was the same kitten I accidentally stepped on. As a precaution, I took the full course of PEP, 4 doses after 4 days since the discovery of the unconfirmed kitten and 16 days after the incident. Although, it was without HRIG or ERIG.

That's all. It's been 5 months and nearing 6 in a few days, yet I still feel scared and anxious. Would it be safe to say that I am safe from the incident? Thank you for your time and insights!

I started getting an itchy back last year but didn’t think much of it, it came and went and then around 3 months it considerably got worse and has now spread to my whole body. There is no rash, only the marks I leave as a result of itching. The marks resemble that of tiny red blisters. 

I contacted my GP after 3 weeks of constant itching, initially giving me creams and antihistamines, 4 weeks later, so improvement of symptoms. GP referred me to see a dermatologist who diagnosed me with Chronic Urticaria and upped my antihistamine dosage to 720mg of fexofenadine but still no improvement, if anything, I feel like it has worsened. I’m back on the waiting list to see the dermatologist again. I am also bruising easily but I am putting that down to the incessant itching.  

In the meantime, my GP has carried out routine blood tests which have all come back fine apart from one which is the Antinuclear Antibody test. The test result came back as a weak positive speckled pattern. I’m due to discuss this with him next week. He has also carried out two urine tests and found microscopic hematuria. He wants to repeat this next week.

It might also be worth noting that I had a total thyroidectomy back in February 2020 due to Graves’ disease. The dermatologist t hought that the chronic urticaria is as a result of having historic immune related problems due to my thyroid but I’m not convinced.

No other symptoms, I’m just getting to the point where I can’t cope with the itching. One small observation I have is that if I cover my body it takes the edge off the itching.

When I looked down, my knee was obviously dislocated. being the only person awake at the time, I decided to pop it back into place. After a few minutes, pain subsided and I was able to get into bed and go to sleep. 
(It hurt a little to move the knee to any position besides straight, so i avoided rolling over or bending the knee when I got up to use the restroom)

Fast forward to this morning, I’ve woken up, and the knee looks completely the same as my other one, no bruising and it looks like no swelling either. After feeling it my acl is still in tact and it feels/ looks exactly like my other knee. But it still does hurt a bit to move it.

Basically I am just wondering what recovery should look like… I have a fairly strenuous job where I am constantly walking, bending, picking up heavy objects, and I just want to know how long I should be gentle on it… because the last thing I want Is for it to happen again.

I would think it was a coincidence if the allergies didn't start at the exact same time as the strep symptoms. I know it's just strep since I got tested for strep, COVID, and the flu, and strep is the only one that came back positive, so this is just... Weird.

Hello and thank you for reading! 
35f, California, white, non smoker, non drinker, healthy diet, 130 lbs.

About 7 years ago I started experiencing insomnia, arthritis in my fingers, and minor anxiety. All 3 have progressively gotten worse but mostly manageable. Insomnia and anxiety are mostly under control. Arthritis flares up every few weeks and lasts a couple weeks. Sometimes I can’t use my hands at all.
6 years ago I got dengue and zica virus - just got sick for a couple weeks and then I was ok. 

Started trying for kids 2 years ago. Started IVF in March. Did one retrieval in March and one in July. 

Went to rheumatologist in February. He suspected lupus at first but ANA and rheumatoid factor negative. C-reactive negative. HLA-B27 negative. 

In June (while stimming for IVF) I started having leg spasms. Then they went away and I just had really bad cramps. 

Leg spasms have gotten way worse I went to urgent care in early July 5 days after my egg retrieval (july 10). They had me go to the ER for US to make sure it wasn’t a blood clot. ER found nothing abnormal except the following blood results.
Magnesium, calcium, phosphorus normal.
Urea nitrogen -21
AST -49
ALT -72
WBC -11.5
HGB -15.7
Neutrophils -79.7

In April 2022, I discovered a bump on the top center on my right wrist after feeling occasional pain; got it checked by a doctor and was told it was a ganglion cyst. I opted not to get it removed at that time, as the pain was very manageable. However, since then, I've noticed an identical bump on my left wrist. My left wrist has been ""bad"" since high school (I received an injury that I never got checked out or properly left to rest), but I don't remember having a bump there before. Neither of these bumps are noticeable unless I bend my wrist forward. However, this past Sunday I noticed a third bump on my the side of my wrist, where the tip of the ulna bone already creates a bump. This bump is quite noticeable in any position, and appears to rest on the surface. Like the other two bumps, it is not a constant pain, but can cause slight aches when doing things like writing or typing, or if it is pushed on. If I was to put heavy pressure on my hands, like in doing push ups or resting my head in my hand, the pain is a bit more heavy, but still bearable.   
I have no cysts anywhere else in my body (that I know of), I never had cysts before, I live a relatively healthy lifestyle and I do not know of anyone else in my family with this sort of issue. Is there an explanation as to why I'm getting all these cysts suddenly, and only in my wrists?

Question: When should I do something about it?

I recently wore a holtor monitor for a week and my doctor called me with the results yesterday.  she said I had 5 events of SVT during that week (where I was barely active due to feeling like shit and now that it’s gone and I’ve been moving around more it’s definitely more frequent). She’s pretty bad at communicating with me and is not concious of health literacy so I’m kind of confused as to what’s even going on. So does this mean I have SVT as a diagnosis? They thought I had POTS but they haven’t given me a TTT so I think I might have both. I also haven’t had an echo yet. 

I’m making this post mainly because I’ve been packing my things up to move the past few days and my heart rate has gotten as high as 179. It doesn’t stay there too long but it does get to over 150 from doing mundane tasks and usually lingers between 140-150. When I lay back down, it decreases to 120s-130s and stays there. I am still having the same POTS symptoms (dizzy upon standing, blood pooling, etc). But until recently my heart rate would decrease to a normal rate pretty quickly when I laid down. Last night, my heart rate also fluctuated between 80s-100s while I was sleeping. I have graphs of everything if I’m not being clear enough. 

I also am experiencing more frequent chest pain and burning. It usually lasts for a few mins but keeps happening over and over again. It’s not unbearable at all, but it is definitely uncomfortable. 

I notice it when I’m laying down but it definitely could be happening when I’m distracted standing up as well. I also have been feeling my heart beat pretty much all the time. 

I don’t know if I’m allowed to ask this but when would this be considered a serious or ER situation? I know chest pain and tachycardia aren’t good signs but when does it get to the plaint that it could be an emergency?

I see a cardiologist for the first time on August 2 and have an echocardiogram scheduled for July 31.

15bektd,"Morning diarrhea following antibiotic treatment
Thank you in advance for reading and for any input you can offer. 

I (30M) recently had an abscess in a tooth that required a root canal. Finished the root canal and it seemed to get better, but the bump from the infection never completely went away. When I went to my follow up appointment to get my crown put on, they started me on amoxicillin. 

A couple days into the amoxicillin, another tooth became infected and got very agitated VERY quickly. Within a day of onset, the pain went from a level 2 to easily a level 9. This was on the weekend and my dentist was closed, their voicemail didn't work properly to relay any emergency recommendations, and the pain was unbearable. I couldn't get into any emergency dentists, so I went to urgent care. 

The urgent care physician looked at my face from afar and said, ""that's dental, I don't touch that,"" gave me additional amoxicillin, and sent me on my way with the instructions to see my dentist. I tried to relax and see if I could make it through the weekend to see my dentist, but I ended up going to the ED on Sunday because the half of my face where the tooth is located blew up like a balloon and the pain was through the roof. 

The ED took a CT scan, switched me to clindamycin stating my antibiotic course failed, and gave me some meds to help with the pain until I could see my dentist on Wednesday (this was 4th of July weekend and **surprise** my dentist was closed Monday and Tuesday). I followed up with my dentist, got that tooth removed, and finished my course of clindamycin as prescribed by the ED physician. 

A couple days after finishing the antibiotics, I began having diarrhea. On the Bristol scale it fluctuates between 6 and 7, sometimes coming down to a 5 for one movement, then going back to a 6 or 7. This started about 2 and a half weeks ago, and primarily happens in the morning. I wasn't able to make it through work, so I started taking Imodium to try to get some control over it. Imodium seems to not really help. I also started supplementing with S. Boulardii hearing it is one of the more recommended yeasts to help with the gut biome following a course of antibiotics. 

Started becoming concerned that it wasn't resolving so I followed up with a Telehealth doctor yesterday who sent me in for C. Diff testing. Got my results today and they were negative. Happy to not have C. Diff, but also at a loss of what to do at this point. I'm doing my best to stay hydrated, drinking liquid IV and water and don't have any symptoms of dehydration as of yet.

Whatever the issue is, it has caused me to lose 20 pounds in the matter of 1-2 months. I also did get a therapist to start some help with the mental side of things. I was diagnosed with adhd and can barely focus along with the nonstop feelings of not being present. Started adderall and it helps a bit.

I thought that quitting was supposed to bring a
bunch of benefits and I hate being pessimistic but I seriously have had no upsides since quitting. I keep a good mind about it tho but I'm just looking for any insight from doctors.

Currently I take supplements for magnesium, probiotics, zinc, antidiarrheal most days so I can retain something, and a brain support supplement. Also 10 mg of adderall.

15bfwdv,"Not sure what to do…

I’m male (18) I’ve always been a pretty healthy kid. It’s not until May this year I started getting health conscious. I was having my annual check up at my pediatrician’s clinic when I was informed on having a high blood pressure. Long story short this lead to me developing an extreme fear of death from after seeing things on the news and other aspects, finally coming to the realization that it can really happen without warning. I w hesitating to even go out. I was constantly in a state of fight or flight for days. At first, I was making sure to not do things that can cause injury, but soon I became frightened about diseases, infections, and conditions.

This came to a point to where I complained to my mom that I was having shortness of breath, feeling like that was a sign of something bad. An hour later I was taken to the ER with my dad for hearth palpitations one shortness of breath. They ran a lot of tests. 2 blood tests and an ekg upon arrival. I even had to stay overnight, and became an inpatient. Obviously the entire time I was on edge since they wanted to take another ekg and an echo.      

I had to wait almost a month before I got my results and thankfully, we’re all normal. My ekg went back to normal, there wasn’t anything abnormal on my echo, my blood tests were fine, and even my blood pressure was going down a bit with diet change although I haven’t been checking it lately.

Last month when I went for a follow up, they said the cause of my symptoms was anxiety which I can see; and since then I’ve been feeling a bit better, but I still sometimes get shortness of breath and recently, a sharp pain in my chest. This pain is like a quick stab that lasts about a second. It doesn’t happen often, but I still notice it when it does. It also doesn’t help to learn that Bronny James suffered a cardiac arrest yesterday.  I know I shouldn’t have but I started to look things up currently thinking I may have pleurisy. I’m just getting tired of all this, constantly thinking of my future. 

I don’t know if these are just psychological or symptoms of a panic attack. I don’t know if I should go back to the hospital to get this checked. I just got back from the hospital a month ago, just last week I saw the bill my parents had to pay.

15bauzi,"[34/F] Weird floaty/dizzy feeling in face/head after days of eye strain, potential face numbness
Hello all. 34/F here. 254 lb, 5' 4"", white female. No drinking, no smoking. Currently have a trimalleolar fracture of my right ankle and am in a cast. T2D and taking metoprolol/metformin.

I had ORIF surgery for my ankle on June 27 and the day I came home from surgery I had a numb tongue. It seems to have only just resolved yesterday, but I've noticed a new problem related to numbness that I'm sure isn't anything to do with my surgery -- still very concerning and it's kicking my anxiety into overdrive.

For the past few weeks sometimes when I fall asleep, I wake up feeling a strange pressure/numbness/weird floaty feeling in the ""center"" of my face. It only seemed to happen when I fell asleep on the couch and not when I went to bed proper. I only get about 4 hours of sleep a night (am working on getting more) and work all day at home from my laptop, long hours as I am a contractor and have a lot of assignments.

Since I'm not able to walk and I broke my ankle I wanted to get into some lifestyle changes so I bought some glasses after getting a new prescription and started wearing them a couple of days in a row. It seems this might be when this all started, but I can't remember exactly. At the end of the day after wearing these very lightweight glasses (plastic), my nose felt cold and I had a weird slight heaviness around my nose and cheeks and it felt like I was still wearing the glasses though I wasn't. I stopped wearing them in a bid to see if it went away. It did, but it concerned me as I had never had that problem before and had worn glasses in years prior.

Today, I woke up feeling fine, and then I wheeled into the bathroom (in a wheelchair until I can be weight-bearing) and turned my head a bit, felt something weird pull in my neck/face on the right side, but thought nothing of it. I went to go back to sleep for a while and slept on my side, something I've done many times since coming home, and woke up with a somewhat numb feeling in my bottom lip. It wasn't completely numb, but the only way I can describe it is ""weird"" as if the sensation wasn't all the way there, if that makes sense. I was so scared I thought I was having a stroke and I sat and tried to wait for it to pass and it seemed to go away.

Now, the entire day I have been having a weird pressure in where I would say are my sinuses with that similar feeling, off and on. I try to fall asleep and I don't know if this is my anxiety but I get short of breath and wake up with a floaty/weird sensation in between my eyes, etc.

It's important to add that the last two days I have had very bad eye strain to the point where I had to take off work today because my eyes were blurry and tired from overwork and I had headaches to accompany the overuse. I assume this might be related but that doesn't explain the issues prior.

I'm concerned at what this could be but can't get to the doctor until next weekend when I get my cast off. I'm also worried because I need to sleep but it feels like the symptoms get worse when I try to, but that might be psychosomatic. I'm confused as to what the problem might be.

Here are some things to know:

1. I tried a magnesium-infused serum stick on my knees before bed last night for the first time.
2. I have been on a low-calorie diet of about 1800 calories a day to lose weight (and plan on tapering down as I get used to it).
3. My blood sugar isn't exorbitantly high and my blood pressure seems controlled.
4. I don't have other pain/issues at the moment.

I'm scared about whether this could be something bad, and why I feel this way -- any help would be appreciated. Thanks so much.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15bauzi/34f_weird_floatydizzy_feeling_in_facehead_after/,,Female,Self

15beqsj,"Increased water intake & feeling very fatigued
30F, 5’9, about 150lbs last I checked. 

Health conditions: Asthma, POTS, hypothyroidism, possible endometriosis (waiting on lap. scheduling), celiac, raynaud’s, ADHD & PTSD

Allergies & Food intolerances (other than gluten): all nightshades (cayenne, chilis, potato, tomato, eggplant, & etc.), corn & sorghum, oat, and daisies (chamomile, echinacea, etc.).

Meds: 88mcg thyroid hormone, albuterol inhaler, Vyvanse 20mg, Aleve/naproxen sodium (right before & during period).

Basically the title. I was diagnosed with POTS and the cardiologist I’m seeing wanted me to try and increase my water and salt intake. She said for me to drink at least 80 oz. of water (about 2ish liters). I bought myself a huge 84 oz. water bottle and have been making sure to finish the whole thing by bedtime, drinking from it all day. I started doing this on Saturday, but since Sunday, I’ve felt really really tired. Like this deep physical fatigue and I’m taking naps during the day which is something I usually never do (partly because of the Vyvanse I take). I’m also just feeling sleepy generally, so I’m having trouble focusing and things even though I’m taking my Vyvanse daily. I have also been trying to add more salt when I cook and having a couple salty snacks a day to increase my salt intake like she directed.

So basically I’m wondering if this could somehow be because of my upped water intake? It just seems like the timing correlates. My thyroid levels were fine on my last check-in about a month ago, because I know that can cause fatigue. 

Is it the water? And if so, what should I do? Is there a workaround? I sent my cardiologist a message but she’s out on vacation for the next week.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15beqsj/increased_water_intake_feeling_very_fatigued/,30.0,Female,Self
15ba3yr,"sudden onset lip/cheek tremor that hasn’t gone away since october; anxiety tearing me up. slightly nsfw
24 male - 5’8, 250lbs, 200mcg levothyroxine, 100mg sertraline, 15mg adderall, 20mg (i think) buspar; very rarely drink and don’t do any rec drugs. got anxiety, depression, hypothyroidism, adhd, sleep apnea, the fun stuff

last october, i had an incident i still don’t understand which is sorta NSFW: after doing the deed (by myself lol), i felt super shaky. jelly legs, arms, stomach, everywhere. this caused me a HUGE amount of anxiety, but after almost a year, i don’t really feel the general shakiness anymore. i chalked most of it up to anxiety about starting a new job and moving in with my girlfriend, so my fear of death became a lot worse because i felt like i had so much more to live for

after the first incident and a normal basic neuro exam, my doctor prescribed me effexor which made everything WAY worse. i was having full blown panics every night basically, and after about two weeks on it, i noticed i had developed a lip tremor whenever i was drinking water and i puffed my cheeks out

obviously this made everything a lot worse, so i saw both a neuro NP and a neurologist; i had a brain MRI done, an EMG, and multiple neuro exams (strength tests, reflexes, the whole shabang), and absolutely everything came back normal. both of them chalked it up to anxiety and said i had nothing to worry about, and for the most part i haven’t, but my lip tremor is still there and it scares me pretty deeply

basically, i can still whistle but it’s not nearly as good as it used to be because they shake a lot. another way i can induce it is if i make the :| face if that makes sense lol

after the brain mri, and doctors observing it, they said it looked like essential tremor instead of parkinson’s bc it’s not a resting one, just positional

obviously i still have no idea what’s causing it and despite most of my anxiety being gone this still causes me a lot of worry. 

all bloodwork was also normal save for my thyroid being low and slightly high RBC/bilirubin (which my doctor told me was barely elevated and due to dehydration since i took it in the morning). negative ANA and nothing else weird about the standard panel

i also feel like i have a jaw tremor which causes me to clench all the time to keep it steady, so i think i’ve also developed TMJ since my jaw fatigues pretty fast when chewing some days

i’ve read up on FND and i really hope that’s what it is, in all honesty i’m scared it’s some sort of motor neuron problem, MS or parkinsons, but obviously anxiety is playing a big part in this

all that said, does anyone have any clue what could be causing this with all of these completely normal tests? is there some sort of test that i need to get that i haven’t? it isn’t ruining my life but it definitely scares me pretty regularly

But anyways! I'll get straight into my symptoms. 

Sorry for the long post.

-Been having tons of pressure behind my eyes or in my sinuses
    >sometimes the pressure behind eyes gets so bad that it feels like my eye just wants to pop out

-sometimes have pain behind one or both eyes

-extreme light sensitivity. I have a hard time going outside on a sunny day. If its overcast/rainy i'm okay. Its tolerable if i sit in the shade or if i'm inside looking outside. I can't stop myself from squinting or closing my eyes and if I try to force them open it doesn't hurt but it feels uncomfortable and my eyes usually start watering a lot and it looks like i'm crying. (I've always been fairly light sensitive so idk if it's actually a symptom but it's been worse lately)

-get black spots in my vision. It's like a little flash and then they're gone. Sometimes get those even in normal light not just bright light. And I've been seeing more floaters or a little dark spec that just follows where I look but if I look at it it moves away and comes back when I don't look at it. The floaters also just move with my eyes but like how water moves. 

-sometimes pain shoots up my nostril as well

-sometimes get the sensation in my nose like there is water in it. Like when you go swimming. Not painful just like noticeable and weird.

-eyes frequently feel like they're swollen like when you wake up after not getting enough sleep. Especially my cheeks underneath my eyes.

-feel cold sensations randomly in my face. Not even when it's super cold or hot just random. Usually in my cheeks below my eyes but sometimes spreads to my forehead. Not numb or painful. Just feels like someone is pressing like a cold piece of metal to my skin.

-eyes frequently feel extremely dry or like, idk how to describe it but the corners of my eyes sometimes feel like tingly? It's like how your mouth feels after you brush your teeth but not like in a good way and it's in my eyes.


-Idk if this is a symptom but it's something that started a year/year and a half before all these other symptoms is that I frequently get these muscle spasms in my face around my eyes, cheeks and mouth. My doctor at the time diagnosed it as a tic because I was extremely stressed out with my job at the time and it would usually happen when I was driving or when I would just think about them. They started a couple days after I got this awful migraine that hurt so bad it caused me to throw up and potentially pass out? All I remember is after I threw up, I went to bed to sleep it off and I was just laying there feeling awful and not sleeping and then suddenly it was 10am. Was no longer in pain at that point but felt like garbage. But anyways now I get these spasms all the time not just when I'm driving or when I think about them. My head feels weird while they're going too like my brain just feels like 'woah' for a minute. They usually only last like a minute or two but will frequently just suddenly stops and then starts again.

And a note as well is that I have had bad sinuses since high school. I got this really bad sinus infection in like 10th or 11th grade and I remember they gave me like Flonase and like a netty pot as well as some meds to help treat it (don't remember what those were) which helped a bit but I have had post nasal drip since then that never went away and when I got referred to an ear nose and throat specialist at one point he didn't seem concerned and just said my nostrils looked really dry. I sometimes get a tiny cut just inside my nostril from how dry it is. I tried Flonase again like 3 years ago for like a couple months and nothing changed so I stopped using it. 

Recently haven't gotten as much post nasal drip since the pressure has gotten worse, pretty sure there's fluid build up (went to the eye Dr last week to rule out eye issues but she did the imaging thing and said everything looked great and should have primary look at sinuses) but would like opinions on if it's severe enough to go in to urgent care or wait for my doctor.

15be589,"25M - Can’t Eat Anything
Hey.

So I’ve basically been starving myself unintentionally. I want to eat. I like to eat. 


I’m a 5’10 male and weighed 190 pounds before this started about a month ago. I now weigh 175. 


Out of nowhere my stomach started to hate everything slowly, even low FOODMAP. Drinking water is even difficult without my stomach revolting. It takes me three hours to eat a single egg. 


For the record, I take Omperizole, Pepcid, and Zofran everyday. None of these seem to do anything. I have a GI who is basically useless, and my primary care doctor keeps forwarding me to GI’s who aren’t taking anymore patients. My current GI wouldn’t diagnose me with anything because I didn’t want to do a colonoscopy, because at the time I was having a hard time eating and dealing with extreme nausea so taking a massive amount of laxatives didn’t sound too appealing to me at the time. 

My endoscopy revealed I had a small hiatal hernia but that was over a year ago.   


I also take thyroid medication. Last time I got tested, my primary said it was a little low but I don’t think that’s the issue. 

I cannot stand for long periods of time without wanting to vomit. I cannot sit down for the entire day after eating without wanting to vomit. I cannot get into a car without wanting to vomit. 

Drinking meal replacements is a no go, because after one sip my body decides it isn’t going to have anymore. I’ve tried multiple brands, ensure, pediasure, random organic crap my girlfriend has brought me.

Basically I’m bed ridden all day with anytime I even remotely get up I feel like absolute garbage and want to die. 

I do have anxiety, but I’m managing that with buspar and Clonazepam. 

I went through something similar last year, but it was nowhere near this intense or debilitating. I was able to eat at least 2 eggs and a piece of toast each day then. 

Basically I’m posting this for any advice or insight while I continually deal with the inability to find a GI doctor that isn’t turning away new patients or my current one who is next to useless.",0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15be589/25m_cant_eat_anything/,25.0,Male,Self

31M, Fit, Non-Smoker, Non-Drinker

Hello!

I was wondering if that is normal.  When I was 15 years old, I found one lump, kinda painful, behind my left nipple. After that, I forget about it. With time, the lump seems to have moved a little bit to the side. The doc thinks that it was maybe just a lipoma, maybe gynecomastia. Nothing to worry about. And, I have 2 other lipomas on each side of my body (near the abs).

2 years ago I got an ultrasound because I was kinda anxious about this and I had discovered more lumps. The result was this:  
''There are no demonstrable solid or cystic lesions or dilated milk ducts. No axillary adenopathy of pathological size.''

Is that normal? I mean, I can easily feel the lumps and all. Why the ultrasound did not see that? 

This week I checked and I think I discovered another lump. They seem connected. All lumps are the same. Not hard, moveable, not really painful. The 3 or 4 lumps make a trail all the way to the beginning of my armpit. Is that still something not to worry about?

I will probably go check with the doc in a month or so but I'm curious. Why did the ultrasound show nothing? If it was Gynecomastia or Lipoma, the ultrasound would have confirmed this, right?

23F
UK

Salicylic Acid use caused red inflamed skin exactly where it was applied.

I was getting tired of having quite a few pesky spots in my eyebrow area so I used some salicylic acid around the area. The next morning the area was extremely red. I then continued with my day and at some point washed my hair. During the shower I noticed the red area started to feel inflamed. When I finished washing my hair I saw that the red area was full of loads of tiny bumps/boils that look puss filled. The small bumps have now (the next day/today) grown into slightly bigger bumps and the area is very 
 very itchy (It’s taking lots of effort not to itch). 

My partner suggested I try hydrocortisone (he suffers with eczema and has used it for red his skin is inflamed and a little ‘raw’). I have been using hydromol to keep the area moisturised. 

Does anyone know what I should do? I am autistic and the itchiness and sensation of it stinging is something i’m struggling with a fair bit due to sensory issues.

15bm5y7,"I have troubling symptoms and need advice on what kind of doctor to go to!!
Alright, friends! My body has decided to show some troubling symptoms in the past year or so--here's the rundown! I'll try to be as detailed as I can.

Info: 21F, 5'10, \~180 lbs, white, never used substances, smoked, anything like that  
Existing medical issues: Severe depression, medical PTSD, anxiety, AuDHD, septate uterus/vaginal pain, recurring vaginal yeast infections, chronic headaches (3+ a week for the past 6 months)  
Meds: Concerta, Zoloft, Guanfacine, antihistamines twice a day, and a probiotic I buy for my stomach issues. I also take a lot of ibuprofen and tylenol for my headaches. Birth control pill to regulate my bad uterus.  
Known dietary issues: I consume too much caffeine and sugar, as it's the only way to slow my brain down and sleep. Like, at least 2 fancy drinks a day. It's bad, I know.

My primary concern is that I may have inherited diabetes or chronic kidney disease from my aunt, with whom I share most of my genetics. My family also has a history of arthritis. However, I have had a long history of very bad doctors, and I tend to avoid going to one as much as humanly possible.

So, as for the symptoms and their severity (listed in the order they bother me most, from most to least bothersome).  
1) Fatigue every day with brain fog that never eases up, even when I take naps. Some days, I sleep 14+ hours with naps, and nothing seems to change. I have fallen asleep driving, at work, etc. Has been here about 2 years. My old doc said it was my Zoloft.  
2) Muscle weakness/pain: I sometimes can't even push lightweight objects. It's as if I am sick with a fever or something, and it is an incredible effort to stand up at times. This comes with stiff joints, particularly my knees and fingers. I can't sleep when this flares up  
3) Hot flashes. I currently have not stopped sweating for about 3 weeks now. It never goes away, even if I take a cold shower or put ice packs all over my body. It is far worse in hot weather, and I notice that I am incredibly short of breath when this happens.  
4) Rib pain? Not sure how to describe this one--if I push anywhere on the front of my ribs, there is a horrible aching pain. A year ago, I also had consistent chest pain regardless of if I pushed on my ribs or not, but that has resolved.  
5) Other symptoms: I've noticed my stomach has been very gassy and bloated all the time, but probiotics seem to help. The soles of my feet and the palms of my hands are constantly burning. My bowel movements are very irregular now. Stomach sloshing along with a decreased appetite.

I feel miserable all the time, and I am finally to the point of taking my 3 sick days to go see doctors. I need to know if a PCP should be my first stop, or if I need to consider a specialist above all else.

Tldr: i’ve had a sudden onset of slight numbness, and moderate pins and needles tingling in different areas all over my body. The spot changes throughout the day. Slight headaches above right eye with a lot of tension and skin crawling feeling in face and head. It gets worse when an area of the body has pressure applied or I bend or lift it. Affecting work and sleep. Periodically gets better and worsens. Has been very noticeable for 4 days. 

I’m not sure if this is B12 deficiency, stress/anxiety response, sign of something worse, but I’d like to get some ideas cause it’s really hard to see a doctor where I live in British Columbia. I eat fairly healthy and sleep normally, no drug use. I’m slowly tapering off of duloxetine but this is very different from any withdrawal symptoms I’ve ever had.
Thank you for any responses! 

I made a timeline of my symptoms if that helps: 

Week and a half before and up to July 24 
Note that hands and arms are going numb and tingling more quickly than usual when I lay down and when I am asleep

July 24 
I notice the feeling in my feet as well as my hands especially when I cross one leg over the other. 

July 25
I wake up and notice that it has gotten worse in hands and feet when I am sitting. I feel it in the truck in my feet quite badly and I’m my hands as I’m working. I get home and have a bath, I feel it begin to radiate up my arms and legs to just above my knees and biceps 

That night I’m woken up frequently by tingling in my arms. 

July 26 morning 
I wake up feeling random little tingles in my ribs and around my body. I have a somewhat sharp headache above my right eye. I take some Advil. I feel little jolts of tingles in my legs and feet as opposed to constant. The constant tingling in hands and feet isn’t there. My right arm begins to feel cold, there’s an icy sensation inside. I can still feel normal sensation when I touch it. I have full range of motion still.
My upper back experiences tingling in my spine and shoulder blades, especially when I’m hunched over a bit.  

1:30 
tingling spine and shoulder blades, spot kind of between spine and left shoulder blade is quite painful. Feeling pain in right arm as well, still feels a little cold and numb inside. Pain and tingling all mostly in upper back so far. Hands and legs feel okay. Feels almost
Like pinched nerve in my right side of neck and arm 

July 27: 
Slept really good actually. Slept almost 12 hours. Woke up with left hip very sore and arms going tingly. Left cheek and jaw feel a bit tingly as well as scalp. Right arm still feels kind of numb/cold 
Top of head and forehead feels very tense

15bdbva,"32M - Unexplained thigh/leg/knee/hip pain (very long plz bear with me)
Going to share the full story going back 4 years so please bear with me    

32, M, overweight and sedentary which may potentially explain some sort of weakness/imbalance in my muscles somewhere?   

In 2019 I woke up one day with a very very minor pain where my thigh/groin meets on my right leg, towards the groin on the inside. I thought nothing of it at the time, but slowly it began to get worse and worse little by little and the location of the pain was moving south towards my knee.    

I was not injured physically in any way, nothing sports related, no car crash, etc. Totally out of nowhere.   

Fast forward a few weeks and I was pretty much damn near temporarily disabled. Couldn’t walk without assistance, couldn’t live my life at all. I had pain in my knee, thigh, and even the lower back area where my tailbone ends. The pain constantly changed locations; outer thigh, then the knee, then inner thigh, up to my hip, just randomly changing.     

I would get brief rest periods of no pain but when it hit it would hit HARD. I would scream and writhe in pain and cry, the neighbors even inquired about noise.    

When the pain is in my knee, it feels like a sprained ankle but inversed. It would hurt when I lift my right leg to walk, as opposed to the usual where it’s difficult to put weight on it.    

When the pain is in my hips it’s a sharp stinging pain or when it’s the outer hip it feels like the bone is rubbing up against my body.   

The really bad pain is when it hits my thigh and my outer thigh muscle down by my knee becomes hard as a ROCK and my knee locks up and I can’t bend it and best description is like getting a leg cramp that doesn’t stop and it feels like the muscle is enlarged and going to rip out from both my knee and at my hip, on both ends.     

X-rays showed nothing. Ultrasound showed nothing. Morphine did not help the pain and didn’t even seem to register in my body. Muscle relaxer did not help. Multiple visits to the doctor and ER. Doctors were beyond clueless and unable to really help in any way. One of them prescribed me Tylenol and sent me home. Took all my willpower to not smack the taste out of her mouth.    

I eventually got an MRI on my hip but the entire process between waiting for appts and everything was taking so long at this point that after a few months it ended up healing on my own as I was waiting to go back to the doctor for my MRI results. I ended up never going in to inquire about the results as I was finally ok.    

I had zero complications after this went away until now.    

Now fast forward to 6 weeks ago. I was doing yard work in which I was squatting for a prolonged period of time. The next two days I had soreness in both my legs as is normal and to be expected. On day 3 my left leg was no longer sore but my right leg had a strange painful feeling. I IMMEDIATELY knew I was about to go through the same exact hell as 2019.    

I have not been able to walk downstairs in over 4 weeks and I am being tended to by family.   

I can barely sleep as the pain never goes away. My sleep schedule has been flipped upside down. I can’t even sit or lay down because however I position myself it ends up hurting SOMEWHERE. I am literally spending all day writhing in pain until I can eventually somehow pass out.    

I am broke with horrible insurance so I don’t really know what the best course of action is to save money as far as do I go to another useless general physician for a referral or do I go to the ER again or what?   

I just don’t know what to do cause the pain can be coming from so many different places and it’s not like these doctors are going to care enough to take images of me from head to toe or whatever. I mean, it could even be a pinched nerve or a bulging disc or something and I’m wasting time getting images of my leg.  

Could a physical therapist maybe be the best first step?

I have been reading non stop trying to figure something out. Been doing a million stretches for everything from piriformis muscles to IT band syndrome to MCL/LCL strains and everything in between. None of the exercises seem to help. Nothing I have been able to find comes anywhere close to matching my symptoms.

15bl6zh,"Cerebral hemorrhage - sudden
Thank you in advance. I am a nurse and don't have any regrets per se but I just want to make sure I did the best by my Mom. My healthy, 78 year old Mom was making a meal for my Dad on Monday, suddenly complained of excruciating head pain (thunder clap headache I would think) and passed out, unresponsive (which never changed). My Dad reports she was having trouble breathing when he found her on the bathroom floor. He called 911. I met them in the ER. She was vented and her CT which showed a brain tumor (we had no idea, she had no prior symptoms) and a large brain bleed with poor prognosis. We talked about decision making for years and knew withdrawing life support was the best idea. She did live for about 12 hours after they pulled the vent. She was on 5lpm O2 via NC and initially was receiving large volumes of Morphine via IV (4-12mg boluses) but then went to 1 mg per hour Morphine on PCA. She had vomited at times with the higher doses of Morphine push and needed Zofran. Her eyes were shut. She appeared to be doing some type of posturing after the vent removal but that stopped with Morphine. She had no gag, no pupil, no pain response - her eyes were shut. My main question is, as I assume she was in more of a coma state versus PVS (and if brain dead she would have been unable to breathe), was the 1 mg of Morphine via PCA adequate pain control? Her HR was low the whole time (40-60), RR off vent 16-22 and no fever; BP was initially 140's/60-70's but went up to 170/101 at one point. My only concern is we promised her we would not let her suffer. She was only on fish oil prior to this so her body was not used to so much medical intervention. I was reading about pain in coma, PVS, etc. and answers vary. I pray the Morphine at 1mg/HR continuous was helpful. I have no regrets but worry I should have been more aggressive with the Morphine (but when we were she vomited, hence Hospice recommended the PCA).

15bkrpa,"22F In the past 3-4 days, I've been having black/really dark stool. Is this my gut bacteria restoring themselves after a course of amoxicillin or is this something else?
Hello

About 2 weeks ago, I started having pain in my mouth where my wisdom tooth was coming out. This happened on a Friday, and the following Monday was a statutory holiday, so for the weekend until Tuesday, I took extra strength Tylenol and Aleve for the pain, alternation between the two. I would take an aleve in the morning before breakfast, a Tylenol extra strength before dinner and an Aleve before bed. On one night, I woke up and took two tylenols in the middle of the night because the pain was too much. It seemed to increase at night. The most of the painkillers I've taken per one 24 hour period is two aleves, and and three tylenol extra strength, and I always made sure to space the painkillers out according to the directions on the bottles. I'm giving this much info about my painkillers because I think they might be a cause if I took too much. I've never taken more than 1-2 regular strength tylenols in a 24 period before. 

On Tuesday, I went to the dentist, and my dentist prescribed me 500mg amoxicillin to be taken three times a day for seven days. She also told me to take advil for the pain until it went a way. The pain was because of an infection where food got trapped between my swollen gum and the wisdom tooth that had come out.

I started taking the amoxicillin and advil. I took the amoxicillin tablets with proper meals and ate probiotic yogurt and healthy foods in between doses. I only took three advil on the first day that I started taking amoxicillin and two advil on the second day. After that, there wasn't too much pain, so I stopped taking any painkillers and just continued with the amoxicillin until it was all done. 

I had diarrhea a few times while I was taking the amoxicillin, but the dentist and pharmacist had both told me this might happen so I wasn't worried. It was not continuous. Like, I would have diarrhea for a bit, but be completely normal the next day.

The day after I finished the course of amoxicillin, I went camping and was camping for 6 days. In the first two or three days, I don't think I pooped at all. I didn't think anything of it cuz I thought I was back to normal with the amoxicillin finished and because I also usually avoid pooping while I'm camping. In any case, when I did poop, it was black/really dark and smelled bad. Not normal. It was a more strong smell than there normally is. This happened one more time while I was camping. Since I returned from camping about three days ago, I've pooped more often than usual, and it's black poop with a really strong smell. 

There was also a peridex mouthwash that the doctor prescribed me. She told me this was to help with swelling and it did help. I used it twice a day for the entire seven days I took amoxicillin and then I used it before once a day before bed after that for about 2-3 days.

So, I'm wondering what the cause for this is. Is this something that is normal because of the medications, like my body is purging it or something? Should I go to the doctor?

Her children were able to obtain her diagnosis after biopsy of the tumor through her chart, which indicated a diagnosis of peritoneal carcinamatosis.

So, long story short my sister (15f) shat herself whilst ASLEEP in a party. She had previously vomited twice and was so exhausted she went to sleep. When I went to check her, i found her on her own diarrhea- ish poop. It was....something. It smelled even morw horrible. 
She drank about 5 vodkas (with juice) and smoked quite a bit (like 6-10 cigs).
I have heard though shitting yourself is a thing with recreational substances in general. 
Is it the combo of smoking and alcohol? Is it possible? Or is it that something more is going on??

15be08p,"Debilitating swelling & exhaustion during exercise or during ''warm'' weather without cause.
I, 27, assigned female at birth, Uk based, 5’4 and 75 kg, physically working out daily and fit, am suffering from a rather...annoying issue.   


Main symptoms include painful swelling of the hands, ankles, exhaustion, excessive sweating, dizziness seemingly at random with a few known triggers. Known triggers are any form of exercise be it simply walking for 5 minutes or doing a full hour long workout. Heat or any temp above 17c with or without higher humidity. This can last anywhere from a few minutes to hours depending on the weather and my activities. In the summer I am housebound on the warmer days due to these symptoms.   


I do not consume any alcohol, I do not smoke, I don't use drugs and am currently taking no medication. I hydrate frequently especially during workouts and monitor my own condition constantly.   


Having been seen by my gp they suspect extreme heat intollerance with no identified cause, they have ran bloodtests and ruled out diabetes and Hyperthyroidism. They have mentioned there is nothing to be done other then bear with it. However having to lay down, call out of work for weeks on end and be unable to move more then up and down the stairs due to the swelling and exhaustion simply isn't an option. Especially not as this will occur in both winter and summer.   


For more detail, the swelling in my hands can be anywhere from 7-9 ring size differences, depending on severity. I do swell in the winter and feel the exhaustion simply by wearing thicker clothing or sometimes pulling on clothing in the morning. It can take my body up to 15 minutes to adapt to the new ''temperature'' and regulate itself so I am not sweating buckets or swelling like crazy. This summer has been the worst so far with me being unable to go outside for three weeks until it began to get cooler.   


Another thing of note is that my sister also suffers from this but the opposite, she suffers from hypothermia on occasion and has woken up freezing in the winter despite layering herself under blankets and having the heating on, she has been seeing her own doctor in another country who has asked her to keep a diary of occurances due to the severity of her symptoms during mild weather. My mother has recently also begun to experience the swelling in warmer weather and both my grandmother and aunt suffered from hyperthyroidism.  


As my doctor is reluctant to do anything else this is a latch ditch effort to get any direction to go forward in with investigations. Any help would be wholly appreciated. ",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15be08p/debilitating_swelling_exhaustion_during_exercise/,27.0,Female,Self

15bk2iv,"Diagnosed WPW and had palpitations all day. I’m having surgery in 6 days, is it worth mentioning?
Hello everyone. I’m a 26yo ftm, have been on Testosterone for 11 months and will be having a double mastectomy on Thursday. 

I’m diagnosed with Wolff parkinson white syndrome and am not currently on any medication for it. I also have MDD, PTSD, anxiety and am on lexapro, buspirone, trazadone and Prazosin. I also use topical minoxidil. My cardiologist has approved me to use the Prazosin and topical minoxidil. 

Today for about 13 hours now I have been having heart palpitations and very mild chest aching. I had my WPW confirmed through several EKGs and recently had a stress echo that confirmed my pre-excitation doesn’t go away with exercise. My cardiologist spoke with my surgeon and approved me to have the surgery, only because I will be monitored the entire time and he gave my surgeon detailed instructions on what to do if I go into a dangerous rhythm. 

Now about my palpitations. It was 96 degrees today and humid and I had to work outside all day. I’ve also been quite stressed out over other things and anxious about the surgery. I figured that maybe my palpitations were from the heat and stress and weren’t anything to worry about. The chest aching is center and slightly to the left, but very very mild and come and go. 

I know that if I tell my surgeons office about this they’ll push back my surgery date again and maybe make me have the ablation before hand instead of afterwards. I’ve already been waiting almost a year to have this surgery and, although I’m sure this won’t be well received, this surgery will be saving my life as being a pre-op trans man is extremely extremely hard on my depression. 

My question is, would it be worth it to even mention this to my surgeons office? The only reason I’m considering it is because the palpitations have been non stop all day and the chest pain (which is abnormal for me). Does anyone have any advice? 

TLDR: I have Wolff Parkinson’s White syndrome and have been having heart palpitations all day. I’ll be having surgery in 6 days and am wondering if it’s serious enough to warrant telling them",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15bk2iv/diagnosed_wpw_and_had_palpitations_all_day_im/,,Not Disclosed,Self
15bkepp,"What Could This Be? [20F]
Hi everyone,

So I recently was vacationing in Florida and went to the pool with a sunscreen on, it was the ""Australian Gold SPF 30 Continuous Spray Sunscreen with Instant Bronzer"", I had never used that before, but never in my life ever had an allergy to any sunscreen in the past. I also used the ""Maui Babe Bronzer"", but I have used this one in the past and never had any reaction to it. Regardless of this, I developed an AWFUL reaction of hives all over my arms and chest/neck in itchy red splotches. It was no wear else though, even though I used the products everywhere.

I could not determine if I was allergic to the chemical suncreen, or developed a new allergy to the sun. I am on birth control and spironolocone currently, but my doctor said they should not have caused a reaction such as this with the sun.

I have never experienced anything like this before, the rashes calmed down and ended up going away, but after about 2 days, the blotches on both arms that were previously exactly where the hives were (this arm being far worse though) turned a bit red and started peeling. I assumed I had just gotten sunburnt there since maybe it was more sensitive due to the previous hives. It began getting darker peeled for a few days, I didn't give it much thought though. Until it stopped peeling and left me with these ugly scars that now look like birth marks.

They are not burns, and they are not rough. They are extremely smooth and literally my skin just darkened. I don't know what to do, online I only see people developing white spots from the sun, but those also aren't huge like this is.

I have NO IDEA what this could be and what to do about it. I am so worried and upset that this may scar me forever. Please someone give some opinions lol it has been upsetting me so much.I have kept it moisturized day and night, used cortizone from the very beginning of the hives, and also started applying treitnoin to try to fasten cell reproduction and possibly lighten it, but I feel like it just is not improving at all. It's just been making me so self conscious and I am so confused as to how this even happened or what to do about it.

Hey guys. My cat did a number on me the other night by accident. PCP refuses to see me and said all cat scratches need to go straight to ER and they won’t look at them there, but everything I’m seeing online says to watch it for symptoms of CSD. Was hoping to just get clarification on if I am able to watch this injury for complications or if I need to see a doctor asap. 

Info about my injury: bite and deep scratch in the middle of the pinky side of my forearm from around 1 AM EST 7/25 from indoor cat that had escaped our home for 45 minutes. Washed immediately, used hydrogen peroxide, covered with Neosporin and bandage overnight. Still washing and using Neosporin to treat and ibuprofen for the swelling and pain. Our cat is up to date on all vaccinations. 

Unfortunately, there is a decent amount of swelling and it is pretty red in the surrounding skin. Tendon in forearm feels painful and tight, can’t really bend my wrist backwards but other movements are perfectly fine. The injury hurts but the worst pain is down closer to my wrist in the center (really painful) and in my upper right tricep strangely, though the tricep pain just started last night. Area around wound is warm but no fever, no loss of appetite, no fatigue, etc. Swelling looks better than yesterday but redness around skin looks like it is spreading. Still leaking small amounts of blood and clear liquid. Looked like a little pus this morning, but it washed away in the shower and has not come back. 

I have included pictures of the original injury as well as what it looks like yesterday and today. I appreciate your help!

Back last June I had open heart surgery to unroof/repair a right anomalous coronary artery with interatrial tract. I had the surgery performed at Vanderbilt after having a CTA, ECHO and ECG done with a local cardiologist. I had chest pains off and on for about 2 years that was chalked up to anxiety but then at a yearly physical my PCP finally referred me to a specialist just to make sure. The ECHO came back normal, EKG had right branch block (Cardio thinks I potentially have sleep apnea, getting that addressed in a few weeks) and CTA came back normal besides the anomalous artery. During post op when the surgeon came to check in on me, he mentioned that I did have some plaque that seemed to be more then someone my age normally has. This has stuck with me since then.  
  
  
  
I have made life style changes as I've lost almost 50 pounds since the surgery, went into surgery at 297, I try and walk 45-60 minutes a day. I completed 12 weeks of cardio rehab after my surgery.  
  
  
  
To this day I still have random chest pains/upper back pain. Could this be caused due to the sternum being cut open and bad posture?

Hello, hopefully someone can help me. 

So I (32F) stubbed my second toe really hard in early December 2022. The toe turned black and blue and was swollen at the time. I was told it was likely a bruised bone and to do the RICE method and give it time. I did not get an x-ray or anything else. Because I have chronic illness (mystery gut pain, fibromyalgia, vertigo, brain fog, Raynaud’s), I was told it was normal it was taking longer than usual for the pain to go away, that it was my chronic pain and the Raynaud’s itself delaying the healing, but that things would clear in time. 

The toe slowly got better over time, even though it still gets slightly swollen and bright red from time to time (happens when the Raynaud’s flares up, and when it does, the toe looks more red or darker than the rest of the foot and becomes more sensitive, but not actually painful, as it was when I first injured it). 

Until a couple weeks ago, the pain had gone away, and it was just the color that was still about a shade darker than the rest of my foot (when I’m on my feet). But now it got really hot where I live, and my toe started hurting bad again in this heatwave, and being on my feet got hard again. 

I was told that by this point, the bone might have healed wonky, and my options would be either to leave it and deal with the pain, or to get surgery, which I want to avoid at all costs.

I’m asking for opinions here because the amount of times I’ve seen doctors, had multiple tests done that came to nothing, had my concerns dismissed and still had to deal with my health problems because I couldn’t get medical help is beyond belief, so I don’t want to put myself through that again if I can help it.

F48, 5'10"", 220lbs (started this ordeal at over 320lbs), Ontario, Canada

TL;dr: I have a wonderful specialist, and I don't want to waste his time with Google diagnoses. I stumbled across pheochromocytoma while Googling if there are any links between small bowel blockages and increased blood pressure (new diagnosis for me) and I have every symptom. However, it's super rare. What would you recommend?

Diagnosed with non-mechanical small bowel blockage in Oct 2022. Numerous tests and scopes showed all symptoms of small bowel blockage, but no \*physical\* blockage.

Previous surgeries: RnY 10+ years ago, partial hysterectomy approx 5 years ago, abdo sx to repair ulcer and investigate reason for blockage, April 2021. No cause found at that time for blockage. 

Attacks started happening Dec 2020.  I was well over 320lbs at the time. 

Attacks include severe headache, nausea, sweating, tachycardia, shakes, severe diarrhea. 

Attacks varied in severity and duration. 

My weight plummeted. 

My vision changed abruptly in my left eye in May 2021. My vision is different degrees of blurry most days. It changes.

I tried everything I could to find correlations between what triggered the attacks, but so many random things did.  Lifting or exerting myself and stress. Laying down made it better, sitting upright or standing made it worse.  Bending over was awful.

I am still severely short of breath and was recently diagnosed with high blood pressure, after being diagnosed with pneumonia. 

I've been tracking my blood pressure at home for a month and it is ALL over the place.  Anything from 190/121 to 110/69.  Again, I have not been able to make any correlation, but it is consistently higher when I am in attack.

I have worked for the past 6 years as a 911 calltaker/dispatcher. Obvious exposure to constant stress. 

Have been off on leave due to PTSD diagnosis.  Was waking up at 3am every day before work having full-blown panic attacks with tachycardia of over 130-150.  

Could this increase the chances of me developing a rare, benign adrenal tumour? 

Is this worth bothering my specialist for?  

Thank you so much.

My foot swelled up from the base of my toes to my ankle in November of 2020, I was 18 years old and I am female. I was about 5’5 and weighed 225lbs. At that time my foot was painful, grew dramatically with each day, and so I had an X-ray, mri, and many labs done. I had no infection, nothing of concern on the mri or X-ray, all anything would indicate is inflammation. I was not injured, i did not to anything out of the ordinary. I hadn’t taken any new medications at the time, I did not drink or smoke and I still don’t. 

Since then, the swelling moved to only my toes and just slightly inflamed at the top of my foot, and the pain has gone away. About 6 months after it first started swelling, I saw a rheumatologist and was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, even though I never at any point had psoriasis. I took methotrexate for a while and after many increased dosages, we saw no improvement and the doctor decided I did not have arthritis, she recommended I try an internal medicine doctor (?). I did, and he could not find anything definitive so he essentially told me to give up and learn to manage. So this is what I have been doing for a while, but I am getting sick of it.

Also, since around the time I began taking the methotrexate, I have been diagnosed with clinical depression and prescribed Zoloft. I am also seeing a psychiatrist next week because I have many symptoms of bipolar disorder. I take a multivitamin and for a while, roughly December 2020-October 2021, I took birth control. I have no idea if any of that is relevant but I wanted to include just in case. 

Currently I am 20 and Female. I weigh closer to 250 lbs. my toes are extremely hard and swollen and nothing seems to help. I still try to ice regularly, wrap and elevate when possible. There is no more constant pain, but my foot grows sore quickly and the swelling worsens temporarily while and after standing or doing any physical activity. I still take Zoloft and a multivitamin, but that is all. Also, because I am young and overweight, I feel the need to include that I am not diabetic, I have just recently had a lipid panel done and I am not at risk.

22F, white, 156 cm,  around 80 kg, I don't do drugs and no alcohol. I take 15 mg mirtazapine atm.

Relevant history: had been given by psychiatrists different anti depressants + anti epileptics+ antipsychotics combinations from the age of 16 through to 20. Only given diagnoses major depressive disorder, anxiety, binge eating + bulimia. No epilepsy. 

Last year I was constantly sick. First the flu, then COVID. When I had COVID my liver took a big hit. ALT and AST were both in the low hundreds. I was tested for hepatitis B and C which were negative. So they reached the conclusion it was paracetamol toxicity. Liver values would go up and down throughout the year, never reaching those really high values again. After COVID I had a resistant fungal infection for about 3 months, then I caught COVID again. And after that I caught a random virus which gave me bad laryngitis and a double ear infection. Then I had two UTIs back to back.  

So I moved to the UK this year and I've gone to the doctor for my mental health concerns. Got treatment, it's alright, I mentioned my liver issues and got blood work done last month. ALT was slightly deranged, they told me to have my blood taken again after a month, which would be like 2 days ago. And then I got a call that i need to go to this urgent appointment in a week for medication. 

My question is...should I worry? I am a bit spooked since I've never had doctors basically chase me for an appointment, nevermind refer to one as urgent. 

I had a liver scan thing done a month ago, it was a free thing offered by a liver disease awareness association. They told me my liver was healthy, not fatty and not scarred. So I assumed my liver enzymes would be fine too. 

I know I need to work on my diet as I tend to eat excessive amounts of sweets, hence my weight. I am starting therapy in August and I want to tackle my eating disorder(s) during my sessions too.

From what I understood heathy skin that hasn’t been wounded won’t heal over, so that would make the whole concept of a husband stitch physically impossible as the opening will only heal up as much as it tore in the first place.

I had some back pain (with some neck pain) for about a week or two, it then went away and I haven’t had pain like that since.

EXAM:  MRI CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST 

HISTORY:  Cervical radiculopathy. 

TECHNIQUE:  A 1.2 Tesla system was utilized. 

Multiplanar MRI of the cervical spine was performed including T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences.

COMPARISON:  Cervical spine MRI 6/11/2021 

FINDINGS:  
Cervical spine vertebral bodies are within normal limits in alignment and height.

The cervical spinal cord is within normal limits in signal. Cervicomedullary junction demonstrates no focal abnormality. 

C2-3: No disc bulge or stenosis.

C3-4: No disc bulge or stenosis.

C4-5: Mild degenerative disc disease with disc desiccation. Broad-based disc bulge with a superimposed central protrusion and annular tear. Stable minimal flattening of the ventral cervical spinal cord. No significant stenosis.

C5-6: Findings have progressed at this level. Progressed disc bulge with a new superimposed central/left paracentral protrusion and associated annular tear with near complete effacement of the ventral subarachnoid space, mild central canal stenosis, and mild cord flattening no significant neural foraminal stenosis.

C6-7: No disc bulge or stenosis.

C7-T1: No disc bulge or stenosis.



IMPRESSION:  
1. Findings have progressed at C5-6. Progressed disc bulge with a new superimposed protrusion and annular tear causes mild central canal stenosis and mild cord flattening.
2. Stable disc bulge with a superimposed central protrusion and annular tear at C4-5. No significant stenosis.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15bedy1/mri_results_help_with_resultswhat_to_expect_when/,31.0,Female,Self

32-year-female. Previously diagnosed with Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos and POTS. I apologize, it’s a long one, but I’m so done with my body right now. 

In March I started having bouts of sudden high heart rate and blood pressure when stationary. I have POTS, but usually blood pressure wasn’t an issue for me and my heart rate was only effected when I stood or was active. But suddenly, sitting on the couch my blood pressure would shoot up to 150/103 and my heart rate to 150. My blood pressure my whole life has been ideal. These bouts would come with chest tightness, trapped gas in my shoulders and back, anxiety, uncontrollable body shakes and teeth chattering. I went to the ER for the first experience and they couldn’t find anything wrong with me and it would eventually die down while I was there. I was tested for a pheocromyctoma (sp?). My cortisol was also checked. All normal. I was put on Propranolol and that has helped calm the bouts, though my diastolic number still gets high sometimes. 

Then in May, I had a pressure headache on the left side of my head near my temple come on one morning. It only occurred when I stood up, sat down, bending or going to the bathroom. This lasted a few hours, and then around 830pm that same day, I all of a sudden felt like I was going to go unconscious, got a tingling feeling that started in my head and washed down my whole body to my feet, and then got very hot. Got an overwhelming sense of doom. I thought I was about to have a stroke, so I had my husband call an ambulance. 

I thankfully was not having a stroke. I had a CTA and they saw a kink in an artery and sent me on my way. I kept having the same sensations but they came in waves. 

I went back to the ER a few days later. They did a repeat CTA and MRI and this CTA was normal this time, no kink. MRI was also normal. 

I’ve had more episodes but they are sporadic, unpredictable and terrifying. And sometimes different. My most recent one, I just had tingling in my head that felt like it was on fire, tachycardia and full body tremors. 

I was worked up for Intracranial Hypertension. My spinal tap was normal. I had an MRV, which was normal outside of “focal intrinsic 
narrowing of the left distal transverse sinus lumen at the level of an arachnoid granulation.” The neurologist didn’t think much of it.

I feel like both of these issues popping up so close together have to be related. I feel like doctors are kind of done trying to figure me out. Im so frustrated and tired of being a mystery. So figured this was worth a try for ANY ideas. 

History of:
Chronic all-over body pain (shooting, breath taking pain that feels deep, almost in the bones)

He said to go to urgent care because if it isn't a stye it is _____ (insert a phrase that I can't for the life of me remember, which is why I'm posting), and if it is the worse thing then I need to get to the ER right away.

So I went to urgent care and the doctor there found a tiny dot that looks somewhat convincing as the gland that is the source of the stye.  She also used the phrase to describe the worse condition (""occular something""?) and said that if it were that, I would have swelling spread around the eye to other parts of fthe face.

My question for you - how would I tell over the next week if it's actually the worse thing?  My temple on the side of my face with the stye feels swollen.  What would be a good indicator for me to seek further diagnosis?

15bb3a4,"Sore throat for 3 weeks
Hi 👋🏻

I’m 31F, living in Sydney where it’s winter. 

I’ve had a persistent sore throat for three weeks following a quick bout of a bad cold. The sore throat only occurs early in the early morning but it’s leading me to wake up from the pain each day at around 3-4am and then I can’t get back to sleep. My lips are also very dry and my nose is stuffy when I wake up. 

The first week the sore throat was lasting all day. But now I t all goes away during the day, just my voice is very hoarse permanently. 

I have seen a doctor a week ago who said he couldn’t do anything but suggested if it kept going I take antibiotics (though even he said antibiotics would only help if it’s bacterial). I haven’t done this. 

I have been doing a sinus saline solution for a few days and haven’t noticed relief. 

Thank you!

ETA - additional info that might help. I’ve been sick since May. I started a bout of egg freezing and was 5 days into the hormones and feeling very tired when I got covid and had to cancel. I got on the anti virals straight away and covid was okay after a bad first day. Recovered from that okay but had a cold the week after for 2 weeks. I then did a full cycle of egg freezing and felt very tired and run down through that, but finished the procedure just fine. A week after that I got the bad cold that led to the sore throat - I had chills, fever, nausea and the runs, that lasted just a day. Through this I have also had a very stressful time at work and have resigned. Could be burnout.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15bb3a4/sore_throat_for_3_weeks/,31.0,Female,Self
15bebuj,"Could my digestive issues be caused by something in my apartment?
White male 30 year old, 185cm and about 78kg.

Across the past 6 months or so I've been noticing a bit of a weird issue. When I spend time in my apartment, I notice that I've been having various digestive issues. To put it crudely, my poos are almost always loose (type 5 or 6 on Bristol Stool Chart), I fart more than I used to, I burp quite a bit (usually small burps, that don't satisfy the feeling of needing to burp), I wake up feeling gassy, and I frequently wake up at 06.30am (about an hour and a half earlier than I'd like wake up) needing to urinate. Weirdly, when I go on holiday or visit friends/family, these problems don't occur - my poos are normal, I'm not so gassy, and I don't wake up early with the need to urinate.

I know that the first thing you'd probably consider is diet, but this doesn't tend to change too much wherever I am. I have a healthy vegetarian diet with plenty of fibre and fruit. If anything, the only major change to my diet is that I eat less sugar when I'm by myself. For this reason, I've now been starting to wonder if there could be some environmental cause from my apartment (a 2-bed flat within a converted house, approx 150 years old) that's resulting in these digestive issues. Are you aware of any such environmental cause for these types of issue that I should look into? Or are there any other potential causes that I should investigate first?

Mucus in stool for one whole year now

32 M, 1.81m, 88 KG fit guy (mostly muscle, I enjoy Powerlifting/Bodybuilding) 


For one year, pretty much after a corona infection (I guess coincidence though) I ""suffer"" from mucus in stool. On first glance it is not really visible when the stool is in the toilet, I only see when I look closely or ""touch"" It with toilet paper. Then the Mucus stays in the paper. When the stool is narrow or with Cracks, in the cracks you can See this tawny Mucus. 

I first noticed it that something changed  after wiping several days only small amounts of muchs after bowel movements. The toilet paper was almost completely ""clean"", besides the small amounts of transparent mucus. 

I don't have any other serious symptoms for which I rule out serious diseases, but who knows. Sometimes I am a bit constipated and after that I suffer from flat stools which require a lot of whining. . I never had any blood in or on the stool nor paper (at least not visible blood). Im not tired and I didn't lose any weight. 

When the symptoms started I first thought it would be normal since I have had mucus in stool in some occasions my whole life, but only like one time a year maybe. But nowadays I have it in 8/10 BM. Could it be light form of IBS or maybe it is cancer cause of occasionally flat poops?

15bh35u,"Subdural empyema

Hello,
My brother who is 22 years old and have no smoking history, sinusitis diagnosed from his childhood. No medications were used until the event occured. Now, he is using Keppra. Here is the story.

My brother, who was 20 at the time, underwent nasal correction and aesthetic surgery in November 2021. The surgery went smoothly without any issues, and no medications were prescribed afterward. However, two months after the surgery, in January, he experienced an extremely severe headache, vomiting and had a seizure. Following MRI, CT scans, and blood tests, he was diagnosed with subdural empyema. Suddenly, he went from being a normal human to being unable to do anything, unable to speak coherently, walk properly, or use the right side of their body.

On the same day of diagnosis, he underwent surgery for drainage. A part of his skull was temporarily removed and placed in their abdomen to facilitate drainage. While in the intensive care unit, he experienced a severe brain bleed on the second day and were immediately taken for an emergency surgery to address the complication. More of his skull was removed and placed in the abdomen. He remained in the intensive care unit for 14 days and then stayed in the hospital for about 60 days.

Over time, he relearned how to speak and perform certain activities. In the first ten days, he couldn't speak at all and could only try to express himself with one or two words. On the 60th day, he was discharged, but he still had the skull defect as the situation was improving gradually. In August 2022, he had skull implants placed to correct the cranial defect. However, after the implants, he began experiencing seizures. Since August, he have had five severe seizures, along with minor episodes of convulsions.

I am wondering whether the subdural empyema was a complication or a result of negligence. I have researched different sources and looked into studies related to subdural empyema, but I couldn't find anything conclusive. Some online sources suggest it could be a complication arising from sinusitis, but my brother already had sinusitis since his chilhood which means all the way before the nasal surgery, and we experienced this issue only after the nose surgery. Do you think this is a complication or a case of negligence? Additionally, are these seizures temporary or permanent? He underwent three EEG tests, and epilepsy was ruled out. His seizures are tonic-clonic. So, are these seizures normal during this post-operative period? It has been almost a year now. He did not have any seizures until his skull placed. All the seizures started after this.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15bh35u/subdural_empyema/,22.0,Male,Other

Thought I saw a bat outside on Thursday night around 3 weeks ago, and don't know where it came from .  
Not even sure it was a bat, just saw something flying about 9-12ft above ground.  
I didn't look what ever it was was flying weirdly.  
I was also outside with a couple people that were talking, but they didn't say anything about it.  
I just saw it out of the corner of my left eye so I didn't get a good look at it .When tried to get a better look at it, it was already gone.  
I guess I'm just worried that it landed on the back of shirt without me noticing it. After I got home took a look at the area that I was worried about, didn't see anything obvious like bite or scratch.  
  
Didn't feel anything weird like a bat climbing or hanging on my bat.  
But at the same time it's there's some bats around that are 0.2 ounces in the area, so I'm not sure if you'd noticed something like that hanging on your shirt. I get a tingly feeling on my back from that fear, and even when I do calm down it that feeling reminds of it again.  
  
But it's only been one session so far so I don't have much to go on yet. Looks like they found a rabid bat in the county I was in. But I haven't been able to find any articles on a date/time and where it was found.... Is there any chance that one bat can infect more than one person.  
Apparently my states only tests bats that are suspected to have bitten a person.  
Are rabid bats able to fly after they are able to spread rabies? Or are they just grounded by then?

Two nights ago, I (31F) had a bit to drink and picked that moment to remember “hey! I haven’t had a bowel movement in a few days, I should take a laxative to help.”

So, I did. It was a Kroger-brand “overnight relief” laxative. Went to bed, woke up and had a bowel movement, felt better. 

I started noticing some mild cramping on and off in my upper stomach last night (24 hours later), and this afternoon had another bowel movement. I noticed there was blood in the loose stool. Maybe TMI, but the blood was definitely IN it, not just on the toilet paper or something. It was light red. The mind upper-stomach cramps are still happening on and off. 

I checked the box and the tablet I took expired in 2021. 🫠 How bad did I screw up? Everything I’ve googled was about laxative abuse, but I only took one and have no history of laxative abuse. And it’s definitely not my period or something. Help?

15bilr5,"6 months of facial/sinus pressure first thing in the morning- goes away when upright or with Flonase.
Symptoms: Starting early February, **I’ve had morning facial pain that feels like a localized sinus infection.** It happens **like clockwork around 5am**, unless I use Flonase religiously. Pain is a dull, gnawing, kinda itchy sensation. Locations are behind the eyes (similar to a fever),  behind the nose and the cheeks.The weird thing is that **as soon as I get up, whether I just sit upright in bed or walk around, the pressure starts to dissipate and disappears after several minutes**. The pressure can be so strong that I feel it in my dreams and it wakes me up until I get myself upright.  
What helps: Prescription **Fluticasone** **spray**, aka Flonase. If I go even two days without using it, the pain comes back. If I use it 1-2 times a day everyday, I forget this problem exists…. Until the prescription runs out.  
I got the prescription from a top ENT in California, whom I begged for something when I met him in February. He took a close look inside my sinuses (even so far as using a scope with a camera and showing me the results on a screen afterward). He saw no proof of irritation/ inflammation or infection. He did point out that my breathing is blocked a bit, likely a result of having septorhinoplasty 12 years ago, and recommended a treatment called VivAer which I have an appointment for in August. Seeing as I don't have constant sinus pain, I'm not sure this is going to help this issue. He also didn’t expect the Flonase to do anything and doesn't believe it's helping me. Cool.  


Background: 30 year old trans guy with a super healthy diet and active life, but complicated medical past. I’ve been taking Testosterone for 1.5 years, so I don’t think it’s related. **Blood work is all great**. I’ve had a ton of sinus issues and infections in my life, though none in the past decade. I had septorhinotplasty at age 18. I had POTS from age 20-29, which left me bedridden the first several years. During this time I had an exploratory epidural blood patch because it seemed like I was a chronic CSF leak patient given my symptoms. Instead of the patch helping anything, it gave me **high CSF pressure for a year in 2017**. I mention this because it **feels oddly similar to this “sinus” issue**, that wakes me up unless I sleep on a wedge or do something to get me upright ASAP in the morning. **The pain did start about a week after a really bad virus, likely RSV, in January that left me filled with mucus**.

Or with the shortening of Ulna, is there hope?

info on me : 21f, 120lbs, 4'11, no medications due to insurance other than my mirena (replaced in 2021) medical marijuana (haven't smoked today) and 100mg of benadryl for sleep (ptsd, anxiety, and physical disability that happened when i was 17) i vape but i rarely drink 

pre-existing medical conditions : adhd, bpd, ptsd, i had my gallbladder removed at 18 due to vomiting a lot and my femur reconstructed at 17 with titanium screws and a rod due to physical assault 

HERE IS MY PROBLEM :

for the past 3 months i have slowly lost my appetite and it has turned to nausea to slowly being in pain due to taking one bite. 

for the past month, it's been impossible for me to eat anything without feeling sick/vomiting. i keep trying to force myself to eat despite the fact that i know that in the end im going to be sick by throwing up or having horrible stomach pains. my diet went from veggies, fruits, healthy foods to me drinking more water to cope with my hunger. i don't feel like there is anything making me not want to eat other than the pain in my stomach. 

i always feel hungry now and when i try to eat, i will take 1 bite and get that gross feeling in my mouth like i am about to throw up. if i don't i end up being in pain and my stomach feeling icky and having to use the bathroom a lot. this leaves me waking up everyday feeling tired, low on energy, not even here mentally. 

today, i felt sick from the moment i woke up and have had no energy at all. i feel extremely light headed walking around. i've tried to stay in bed most of the day but my stomach gave me the worst cramp imaginable to where it felt like a stabbing pain in my stomach. it slowly went away so i decided to eat chicken ramen with an egg to help me feel better and i it took me an hour to eat it while fighting with the nausea and then the cramps came back for 45ish minutes and it stopped. 

i told my boyfriend and my grandma and they told me that i should look into to going to the er and getting checked because i've been getting sicker it seems but i don't have insurance/stable finances to support a trip to the er. 

my boyfriend also keeps mentioning that i should be checked for an eating disorder, but wanting to eat is not an issue until the stomach problems, but I have always had stomach problems but they were ruled out after my gallbladder was removed in December 2021 and none of my past doctors took my stomach problems seriously since I got it removed.

I just really want to eat something because I am so hungry and tired of feeling sick and I would like some answers and clarity to know why this is happening.

edit : i just threw up my ramen right after i posted this so i guess i'm not keeping anything down ??",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15beh7q/been_sick_for_a_month/,21.0,Female,Self

Age 26

Sex Female 

Height 5”6

Weight 85kg 

Hi all, 

On Tuesday afternoon I had both of my lower wisdom teeth taken out using local anesthesia. The operation went well and I was sent home with amoxicillin 1g to take twice per day and Lamaline in case of pain. As well as a mouthwash. 

On Tuesday evening and Wednesday all was going really well. I had minimal pain and swelling. However today the pain has been getting slightly worse. The thing that is bothering me the most however is that my chin, neck, shoulders and front of chest are very tender to touch. I have mild chest pain and palpitations (however I frequently get this due to anxiety). Is the tenderness just a standard post procedure symptom ? I also have dizziness.

15bgnuv,"27F - Low Back Pain Isolated to One Side (6-Months), Hard Lump Not Visible(2-Months), and Loss of Appetite (2-Months)
Hi all,

Reaching out for some guidance here, and I do have a planned appointment with my PCP coming up soon. 

* Diagnosed: Anxiety, ADHD, Genetic High Cholesterol 
* Medications: Anxiety & ADHD Medications
* 130 lbs/58.9kg

**Symptoms:** 

* Lower Back pain isolated to one side and seems aggravated when lying down. I've had this for 6-months now and initially thought this was due to my job (9-5 desk job), but I have utilized my standing desk and get up to take breaks frequently to prevent sitting all day. However, the pain has worsened to the point where it's becoming a constant pain on one side. 
* Lump in Lower Back Pain Area: Since having this level of pain, my husband has been nice enough to try to give me a back rub to assist, however, he has noticed a lump (small, hard - coffee bean size) on my right side that's not visible in the mirror. However, when any pressure is applied, the pain shoots into my legs and causes a tingling sensation.
* Loss of Appetite: This has been the most noticeable. I understand I take medications for ADHD, which may cause a decrease in appetite, however, due to the shortage of ADHD medications for the past couple of months, I have not had my regular prescription. Despite that, while taking my medication, I'm still able to eat normally. Recently (a couple of months), I've noticed my appetite has completely disappeared. When I do eat, I eat about 25% of my normal amount of food, and I feel full.

I would appreciate any insight and guidance on how best to proceed!",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15bgnuv/27f_low_back_pain_isolated_to_one_side_6months/,27.0,Female,Self
15blnhk,"Should I seek treatment for rabies?
Hey all, 

25M, 5’9”, moderate-severe asthma,
Dupixent, Spiriva, Symbicort, Albuterol, Singulair

Just came back from a vacation in St Martin/Sint Maarten Island (carribean) today. On Monday, I had went to a bar where my group was petting/feeding a group of 4 stray dogs who were hanging out by the bar. I made sure not to touch them, but did get handed drinks from my groupmates who were petting the dogs. 

At one point, one of the dogs licked my calf, and the area licked had a pimple/blemish/sore in the area the dog licked. It was not actively bleeding nor do I remember it ever really bleeding. May have been scabbed over. Not sure if that qualifies as an open wound. This is what has me most concerned.

The dogs were behaving normally in relation to other strays I saw on the island (strays are everywhere on st martin, must have seen 100+ during my time there). The one that licked me was pretty social, hanging out in the bar, sitting near guests begging for food, accepting pets, laying down, playing with one of the other strays. Typical dog stuff. It also had a collar, where the other 3 strays didnt, but I didnt see if the collar had a rabies vax tag. The other 3 strays were not as social/domesticated but were hanging around the bar and accepting pets as well. None of the dogs were aggressive towards each other or people. Two were quite old and seemed tired but I wouldnt call them “lethargic” and they werent having trouble walking.

The CDC says st martin is “dog rabies free” and the UK classifies the island as having “no risk” of rabies. 

https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/saint-martin

https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/countries-risk.html

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rabies-risks-by-country/rabies-risks-in-terrestrial-animals-by-country#s

Per the literature, there are no species besides maybe bats that have endemic rabies on the island. I also cant find record of any cases of rabies amongst dogs or people on the island. Imported pets are quarantined and must show proof of vax as well.  

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6160905/

I would hate to have to go get the vaccines because most of my group would also have to go as well and they are expensive. I would have likely gone already but with the sources claiming the island is rabies free and the dogs acting normally I feel like I may be overthinking.

I’m a 29 y/o male and I weigh 180 pounds. This feeling is kind of new to me because I generally don’t have any major health issues. The only medication I take daily is 20mg Adderall and I’ve been on that for the last few months. My most recent lab work was done back in January of this year and the only thing they noted was slightly elevated liver enzymes and my red count was a little low. I quit drinking alcohol completely in December so I’m hoping that helped my liver some. My blood pressure also runs generally normal (usually 110 systolic) and I make sure to eat enough food in the day and drink water. 

Sometimes when I lay down I notice my head spinning a little and I feel dizzy. Even whenever I stand up I find myself feeling like I stood up too fast, but this has been happening constantly. It’s almost to the point where I feel like I might pass out so I have to get my composure before I move. I’ve never had these issues before so this is just a little odd to me and I’m not sure what could cause this.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15benji/29m_i_constantly_feel_like_im_getting_dizzy_and/,,Male,Self
15bldzw,"[NSFW] unable to properly m*sturbate
Hi all, 20M here. Medication I have taken hasn’t really changed, I take Levetiracetam (aka Keppra in the US). No alcohol, no drugs, no cigarettes.

Since approximately the end of last year-ish I have experienced an extreme decrease in sexual drive. I have no clue what caused this, but normally I would always look forward to relieving myself and I would get riled up looking at attractive females. However, since the end of last year I have somehow lost the ability to properly m\*sturbate. I have visited a doctor who told me that it was somehow fine?   
But I am certain that he was mistaken, he even told me I could potentially donate my sperm but I have not thought about doing that thus far. Onto the details; the only time I really get hard is if I force it, by looking at porn. I literally don’t get hard looking at anything revealing that’s not nude, and before this all I never really masturbated a lot, I am certainly not addicted and would only do it once in a couple days or sometimes even weeks. One thing I have started doing more since then is holding in my pee when I’m in bed. Before sleeping I tend to drink stuff since I’m up late, and also have to drink a little water to take my meds, and when I wake up I’ve always just stayed in bed and always held it in for a long period until I would get up in the afternoon. Would that be a potential cause?

more details; every time I try to … bust … it’s always a tiny little squirt, very rarely when I really try hard enough and keep a good sensation going I tend to spew some sperm but also not a healthy amount I’d say. What can I do to further diagnose this issue or what is a potential condition I might have developed? Please ask any more questions if you need any additional details.

15bd85q,"What looks like endo but isn’t?
21F previously diagnosed with migraines, and GERD. Currently taking Visanne and Topiramate (25mg/day).  

Approx. Jan 2022 began having migraines (no aura) and NP took me off birth control pill (I’ve been on it since I was 13-14, initially went on it due to severe cramping, and heavy very irregular periods) as first step in treatment plan. In the years I was on birth control I had very little cramps with my periods, and they were very tolerable.

After coming off the birth control pill, I received the Nexplanon implant without estrogen. About a week after coming off the pill, I began getting near-constant debilitating cramps. I could barely go into work for my shifts and had to leave many many times. I ended up gaining 80 pounds in approx 4 months and ended up in the emergency room as I wasn’t sure if the Nexplanon could’ve been the cause of the weight gain but I was at a very low place and I needed to have it removed. I’ve ended up in the emergency room multiple times in the last year for Toradol shot as this was the only form of pain relief that seemed to work. 

The original thought by doctors was that the birth control may have began covering and controlling endometriosis symptoms at a young age, but coming off of it triggered the disease to flare up uncontrollably. I was on birth control again for about 6 months more recently, but this did not get the pain back under control. I have now been on Visanne for 2 months, but haven’t yet gotten any relief (although I was told it could take 3 months to make a difference). I had a laparoscopic surgery to look for and excise endometriosis a week ago, but the doctor who performed the surgery did not find any definitive endometriosis. The only thing that was excised was something small from my peritoneum which I am awaiting pathology reports for. 

The only way I can describe the cramps is that it feels like my insides are trying to claw their way out of me. They are always in my lower abdomen, and most of the time in my lower back on both sides as well. It also aches badly into my left hip at times, and frequently radiates down into my left thigh. The pain definitely seems to get worse the same week each month, although I haven’t gotten a period since I’ve been back on the birth control or Visanne. The pain also flares up greatly with physical activity, as well as with stress. The cramps occur nearly every single day, and are debilitating to the point that I have been off work for months. I’ve tried TENS, heating pads, and all types of over the counter pain relief. At one point I was getting relief with Aleve but was having to take 8 Aleve within a 12 hour period just to get through a shift of work (I’m aware this is well over the daily limit but I couldn’t afford to be off work and nothing else helped). I had a prescription for Tramacet (37.5/325), but this didn’t touch the pain either. Vaping marijuana seemed to be the only form of at-home pain relief that actually helped at all, however I’m no longer using it. 

My bowel movements are very unusual, and I have very frequent diarrhea. It’s not uncommon for me to have 3 bowel movements in a given day, but at times I’ll have as many as 10 (and this will go on for weeks at a time sometimes). It is common for them to be diarrhea, and in the last 6 months they began being very mucus-y.

I have no conditions, take no medications, am overall healthy. 

BACKGROUND; Positive pregnancy test was done July 17th, blood test done July 24th. Period in June was 20th to the 23rd which is abnormal, mine are always 5 days. 
Dr put May 24th as LMP thinking Junes was not actually a period. Test came back with HCG levels at 240, today she called to say it’s probably more likely that the period in June was in-fact a period, just shorter than the norm. So I’m 3-4 weeks currently meaning 240 would make sense, and I hadn’t had any signs of miscarriage.. until now, possibly. She asked I go back upcoming Monday to redo blood test, and had me booked for ultrasound that day too following the date she initially used of May 24th.. Which leads me to what I’m here to ask. 

Today, my nipples aren’t as sore as they have been for 3 weeks which is fine and dandy. After speaking to my dr I went on a walk that lasted an hour and 20 mins. About 30/40 mins after returning home, I went to pee and seen light brown on TP and had been feeling a dull ache in my pelvic/pubic area. Went to the bathroom again and it still looks brown, but also kind of pinkish. Is this and the dull ache normal? Or, CAN it be, I should ask? Should I be going to get looked at now, monitor, or what?

He diagnosed me with something he called ""Reactive Airway"", which led to more confusion. My symptoms haven't changed since I stopped inhabiting the guest house. Here are my symptoms: Extreme lung sensitivity to ANY kind of pollutant, chest pains all over upper body, sometimes my shoulders hurt (on the part where my shoulder connects to my neck), sometimes I can feel the lymph nodes in my neck getting inflamed. Sometimes I can feel the pain in my arms, stomach, and even my fingers at times. I am infrequently coughing, but when I am it will either be a dry cough or a very productive wet cough with lots of white phlegm. I have a nebulizer, but it doesn't really do much for the pain, just makes me hack up more phlegm. Sometimes, during more intensive coughs, I make a high-pitched wheeze noise - like my lungs are whistling. I bought a VERY expensive air purifier that filters out VOCs in the air, and when I'm in this room with the door closed, I'm doing alright. Not 100% painless, but probably as close to that as I can get. As soon as I open the door and walk into the hall, however, my symptoms come back fairly quickly. It has been like this for 5 months, and I'm starting to worry that this won't be going away.  
  
My questions are; Was there anything my doctor left out or didn't care to explore? What exactly am I dealing with? Is this going to be chronic, or will it go away eventually? Is there anything I can do to speed up my recovery? There are certain areas of the house that cause my symptoms to flare up, should I try to find a way to move out with what money I have left? What exactly is Reactive Airway?  
  
Please help me. This situation is ruining my life.

Info: 23F, 150lbs, 5’6”, Caucasian, no medications. 

Hi! I’m currently about 10 wks pregnant and my OB just ran a bunch of initial blood work. 
This came in tonight, and it looks like my Hep C antibody test was slightly reactive, at a 3.41. Got flagged as abnormal. Does this mean I currently have it? Or that I did and it’s clearing up? I haven’t had any symptoms, and was tested about a year ago and was not reactive. 

Last year I was working in the dental field and around patients with various types of hepatitis, but again, tested negative up until now. 

No drugs, recent tattoos, etc. The only thing I can think of is my husband being exposed through his job (firefighter/EMT), or from when I was in the hospital giving birth to my 9 month old.

Any ideas? Does this seem like more of a current infection or like it’s passing? Or could it be a false positive? Kind of freaking out because I’m pregnant and also have a baby that may have been exposed to it through milk. Thank you!

15bivzl,"28F - Neurology help
28F, 140lbs, 5'6""

Last Wednesday I suddenly developed a weird sharp sensation at the top of my head. The pain is in the top/back middle of my head, right where the part of my hair ends. I would describe the pain as a 6 out of 10. It could be worse, but it is very distracting.

The pain came on when I was a bit stressed, I've also been dealing with some weird nerve sensations in my left leg and was a little worried about that. (Stabbing pains, burning skin feeling) When the pain came on, I started to have a bit of what felt like a panic attack. I felt a little dizzy and my boyfriend helped to calm me down. After that, I felt totally normal besides the stabbing sensation. My leg pain even went away.

I tried some Advil and magnesium and nothing helped.

Fast forward to Sunday and the pain is still there. I had a normal stress-free weekend with the pain still lingering around. Sometimes I can feel the pain travel to the front of my head, but it always goes back to that one spot. I notice my right ear feels a bit numb. I decide this is not normal at all and I go to Urgent Care. They advise me to go to the ER. At the ER they monitor me for a bit, give me Tylenol and a muscle relaxer shot. This does nothing to help. They send me home.

Now it is 8 days past the onset of the pain. I went for a massage the other day which did not really help at all. The pain is a bit less today, but I also now have a ton of pressure around the back of my head spanning from ear to ear.

I have an appointment with a neurologist for Tuesday but I'm worried I've had some sort of mini-stroke or something and wondering if I should go back to the ER and ask for an MRI instead of waiting.

I've had health anxiety in the past but this feels SO different from anything I've ever experienced. I never usually have headaches. I need advice.  


Editing to add: Other health conditions include POTS, Hashimotos, and B12 deficiency. 

My TSH is normal so I am not medicated for Hashi's. I am prescribed beta blockers for POTS but only take as needed. Have not taken in months. I have tried to work on B12 but have had bad reactions to the brands I've tried so far so I've been unable to correct the deficiency.

15aokr7,"I (Male) was positive on a pregnancy test, what does that mean?
So a little bit of context, my best friend (F24) has extreme anxiety and had a little “accident” with a hookup a few weeks ago. She had reason to believe she may have been pregnant but was too anxious to take a pregnancy test. Because it’s kind of a big deal, I (M24) offered to jokingly take one with her so she wasn’t alone. The thought of a male taking a pregnancy test was just funny enough that it eased her mind enough to do it. So I followed through and took one with her. Hers was negative of course, but mine was positive. Naturally we thought that was odd. We didn’t think we’d mixed them up, but it was odd enough that we each took a second just in case, this time marking who’s was who’s. Same result, her negative me positive. At this point I started to panic and did a third, just me this time, and was positive again. 

I don’t take any medications outside of over the counter allergy medication (Xyzal), and I don’t do any other drugs at all. I’m regularly tested for diabetes because of my job and I’m definitely not diabetic. I don’t have any other medical conditions that I know of. I also don’t have health insurance so I can’t go see a physician, hence posting here.

What does this mean? Is this normal (it can’t be right)? If it’s not normal, what do I do?

Edit: ok I’m definitely going to go see someone, but I’m not sure which type of physician to see. I don’t have a primary, and I don’t want to waste money on one since they will just send me to a specialist anyway. But I don’t know which specialist to see. Oncologist? Urologist?

Edit 2: I called the local hospital, surprisingly they answered this late, and they have an onsite clinic and a primary care physician that can see me as soon as tomorrow. Turns out I meet the requirements to be put on Oregon’s OHP/IHN insurance. The nice lady reassured me that it would retroactively cover tomorrow’s visit once I’ve been put on it. Thanks everyone who replied, I appreciate you all! I’ll update this when I know more.

Edit 3: Update! I don’t know how many of you will see this but here’s today’s update. Went to the PCP this morning, she did the ol’ feel check on the boys and didn’t feel anything so she decided to do an ultrasound (but did say the urologist will probably do one too). The ultrasound didn’t show anything on or around the testicles. She did mention that HCG is present in any number of different tumors through the body, so it’s possible that I could have a tumor somewhere else. There’s also a few other non-tumor conditions that can create HCG, but it’s most likely a tumor somewhere within the urinary system. She’s referred me to a urologist first and doesn’t want to refer me to an oncologist just yet, but said she could do that over the phone after urology if needed. She also preemptively ordered an MRI and some blood work. The local hospital has a walk in lab and imaging center, so I’ll head there tomorrow. The urologist is fortunately in the same building as the PCP, so I got that scheduled too. They got me an appointment for Monday. All told a really quick and efficient process, they apparently do not mess around when it comes to potential cancers. The whole thing was taken very seriously and professionally.

2. Surgeons do not feel comfortable with another surgeons prior work. ( 100% understandable ) although, leaves me with little options.

As the title reads, I’ve been to the hospital for this very strange phenomenon that has turned the tip of my left middle finger a dark red / black colour about 3 times now and all these times I’ve been told that;

“it’s healing”. 

For reference, I am a 20 year old male from Canada, about 6’3, & 210lbs. I smoke everyday, (nicotine and marijuana) and this all started with an ear infection. 

On June 30, 2023 I got diagnosed with an ear, nose, and throat infection along with a mild case of bronchitis. A week after that, I got a pus-filled abscess on my left middle finger that was tender to the touch. 

Fast forward a week after that on July 10th I went to my doctor & he diagnosed my finger as a Paronychia from biting my nails with infected saliva getting into the broken cuticle from my throat infection. They prescribed me Amoxicillin & told me to go get it drained if it got any worse. 

I went to the clinic about 3 days later because it was full of liquid. The entirety of the tip of my finger. They drained it, then 3 days later it came back but worse. So I went to the hospital for the first time, they then cut it open & drained it again. 

After 4 rounds of antibiotics; Clavulin, Amoxicillin, Cloxcillin, & now finishing Clindamycin, (in 3 weeks), my finger has turned a dark red / black colour. 

(Photo in comments). 

I’m aware that acute Paronychia can take up to 6 weeks to fully heal but I can’t find any photos that look similar to what I have. 

At this point (July 27, 2023) I went to the hospital once more (yesterday) because my mother insisted & was stressing me out that it has somehow turned into Gangrene. They saw me after a 12 hour wait & dismissed me saying “it’s in the healing process”.

15bcgi7,"Broken dens… how does this happen? Does it necessarily have to be from an injury?
I have been having neck pain for the past seven years, which just happened one day.  Completely unexplained. I underwent a few CTs and X-rays over the years, and these are the findings:

2022: “Stable mild deformity of the tip of the dens which may be
related to old injury.”

2020: “7 mm calcification abutting the lateral aspect of the dens, unchanged. This may be due to prior injury or ligamentous calcification.”

2019: Calcification measuring up to 0.9 cm AP by 0.5 cm transverse dimensions abuts the medial aspect of the lateral mass of C1. The medial
component of the calcification abuts the lateral aspect of the dens. This
finding is potentially due to changes of an old fracture versus ligamentous

hi. my dad was 52, smoked ALOT of marijuana and cigarettes, heavy cocaine use unfortunately, and im sure other things. he suffered from heart disease (95% blockages in almost all arteries and a calcified valve), had cardiomegaly, and had emphysema. we did not know about any of these health conditions until after he died. it is not very clear how he exactly died, however, it is between either a seizure or a heart attack in his sleep but neither of these were ever truly verified. the IMMEDIATE cause of death was cardiac arrest, and my stepmom said he was turning blue that morning and was making horrible sounds before it happened. his SIGNIFICANT cause of death was a cocaine overdose. he passed away at 8am, and apparently had not done any drugs the night before. i am not entirely understanding of the significant cause or exactly what this means. did he suffer while dying? was he suffering before he died? a few weeks before it happened, he did know something bad was going to happen, but couldnt predict this exactly. and i don’t know if he knew bc he was suffering, or what the issue really was. can somebody please explain these things to me and help me?

This is a weird thing and maybe nothing. I am setting up appoint with GP but wanted to get opinions here. 

I notice over the last couple of months that I am losing subcutaneous fat but not exercising and have been fairly inactive. However I’m not losing visceral fat which I have in my midsection. I can tell as the pinching fat is less and definition of muscle in midsection is getting more pronounced. However scale isn’t changing, I’m not weigh training and my clothes are not getting looser. I know you’ll think I’m crazy but I know the fat is depleting. I do not have any other symptoms like pain in abdomen or something else.

I’ve just not been having the best time lately, and I have been in touch with doctors but still feeling not so sure/confident. 

   - So about 5-6 months ago I started getting daily headaches/migraines and about 20/30 days of the month I had them. Told my doctors, we did routine blood work and everything came back normal. 

- headaches still continued even to right now, and nothing has helped much. Went to the ER a couple of weeks ago. They gave me tordol (not sure if I’m spelling that correctly) and it helped maybe a tad? They also did a CT without contrast, and it came back normal. With that being said, could something have been missed????????? 

- fast forward to this past Monday. I woke up at 4am with HORRIBLE pains in my stomach and instant diarrhea. (The pains are nothing new I’ve always had them when I get horrible upset stomach, but not every single time) about lunch time that same day, i had minimal diarrhea again. 
- Tuesday, woke up again at 5am with the same thing. Minimal diarrhea at lunch time. 
- Wednesday no diarrhea in the morning, not remembering if I had any at lunch time? 
- today, woke up with it AGAIN at 5am and i was 7/10 bad. Called my doctor, did routine blood work, urine sample, and took home tests to do for my stool. I have filled 2/5 tubes. After the doctors my stomach was hurting pretty bad to the point I was going to cry. 

As of now, the front of my head hurts pretty bad and I just feel soooo sick. (Left side of face feels sorta numb and tingly as well which has happened before) I just genuinely do not feel good, and it’s making me concerned. So what is the deal… 

I’m high anxiety and stress, but could this really all be related??? I don’t know what to do anymore. I seriously never feel good and it’s exhausting.

15begg3,"Practitioners seemingly avoiding giving me pathology results in patient portal-- OBGYN help?
**I am:** 34f, 5'3, 135lbs, white. I don't drink/smoke/use drugs (wine/liquor on occasion, but less than monthly)  


I had a hysteroscopy & D&C ablation last week due to really heavy & painful periods & a thickened endometrium (17mm). I have very low testosterone (<3), so there's estrogen dominance, but everything else bloodwork-wise is normal. Historically: I've had 2 kids, both high-risk with complications from Pre-eclampsia and HELLP Syndrome, resulting in hemorrhage. All of that is fine now, and I have no lasting issues. I have Von Willebrands, a very mild bleeding disorder.   


**Onto the issue:**

The results of the biopsy from my D&C biopsy last week are technically ""released,"" from my OBGYN and it reads ""PROLIFERATIVE ENDOMETRIUM WITH FEATURES SUGGESTIVE OF POLYP.""   


And like... well duh. lol. Big surprise there. The details with the actual findings show a ""long formatting error,"" in the gross description, microscopic description, etc., sections. So, I'm not able to see what type of polyp is it. 

  
I contacted them, asking to have the full results uploaded in a format compatible with the portal & the MA kind of deflected, stating that the doc will go over results at my post-op next week. I explained that I really would like the full results before then, please (and was really chill about it-- we were both laughing on the phone).   
She made it abundantly clear that they couldn’t discuss the results over the phone or before the appointment, which I said was just fine, I just wanted to see them so I could research, have questions ready for our appointment, and (most critically) so I can give proper timeline projections for the launch of my company to investors (a meeting that is imminent).    
I emphasized, both in message & on the phone, that I'm significantly more stressed about work stuff than I am about any less-ideal results from the biopsy (frankly, I don't have time to worry & I've never really been the person who ""worried"" about things outside of my control in the first place-- even about medical stuff. To me, there's not much I can do either way, so I'd like to at least be able to research & know what questions to ask). I 100% trust them & will not panic, even if the results *seem* scary at first (I know it's *highly* unlikely they are, anyway). I'm not at all a typical candidate for anything too serious, and even if it is something that requires more testing/procedures, I sincerely care more about the timeline than anything else.  
The MA I talked with seemed to understand & agreed to upload the full report. I've asked them about it both yesterday and today, and they still haven't uploaded them-- despite each time saying they would upload them.  


I followed up just now once more about a tangential issue (needing antibiotics for a UTI- I sent them a picture of the OTC test that showed nitrites). They handled that immediately, no issue. When I thanked them and asked about the results again, they read the message but didn't reply. 

At first I thought they were busy/distracted. Now, it seems pretty clear they don't want me to have the results. Maybe they're running more tests? Waiting on more info? Still, it seems very odd to say ""I'll do that,"" and then just ... not.   


What gives? Surely they understand that a few days of saying, ""We'll get those to you,"" and then not doing so/avoiding it is a lot more concerning than just ... giving me something that might indicate hyperplasia or whatever it could be.   


I'm getting really frustrated to be treated like I'm a pest (or perhaps just too stupid to understand results).  


From a provider perspective, how would you would advise me handling this kindly & respectfully?

Hello reddit. Back in April, I developed a very severe rash on my lower stomach. It was constantly hurting, and even oozing a good amount of liquid. It took me a couple weeks, but i finally went to see the nurse at my college. She told me it appeared to be a fungal infection. She gave me a steroid shot, which cleared it up for a day or two. She also told me to buy antifungal cream and apply it for a few weeks. Well this was back in April, and this thing has still not gone away. It looks a lot better now, but if I stop applying the cream, it gets very itchy. And when I scratch it, it seems to go back to where it was before. Basicallycally all nasty looking and oozing liquid. I know I need to go see a doctor again, but I just keep thinking it's cleared up, only to realize it's not. I have been applying thus cream almost every day.

At that point my boyfriend decided to give me a piggyback ride the rest of the way (probably like 30 seconds-a minute), but then he got really exhausted and it was worse for him than for me.

I ended up going to the doctor just to make sure I was fine. My pulse was 103 but everything else was normal, they said I needed to just stay inside for a couple of days and drink a lot of water.

15bn1f9,"Lost 30lbs in 2.5 months - no exercise, 2000kcal/day, my body hurts all the time
Mysterious debilitating pain

Howdy!

I’ve been on a long search to find the answers to excruciating pain and discomfort and every doctor I’ve been to this far has not given two shits about me and almost never follow through with “referrals”.

Just wondering if anyone might have a suggestion on which discipline might be best to visit? I’ve been spending so much time and money with different doctors that have done absolutely nothing. 

Symptoms: 
- intense ache all over body with no relief - like having the flu without any of the “sickly” symptoms

- random zaps of pain - almost like a cross between a stabbing and how a cramp feels, but it doesn’t increase in pain and the muscles don’t tighten, it’s just pain to be painful. Completely unpredictable and can bring me to my knees in the middle of anything 

- my muscles tire out extremely rapidly - if I do the dishes, I’m down 2 full days to recover. 

- I cannot get enough sleep. I take at least 2 one hour naps per day and sleep at least 7 hrs every night. Never feels like I slept at all and I get recurrent cricks and tight muscles I get in my neck and shoulders 

- I’ve lost over 25 lbs in the last 2.5 months and I’m eating around 2,000 calories a day, but I am on the AIP protocol diet to take matters a little into my own hands to see if food might be triggering this

- I can no longer be in the heat for more than an hour at a time. If I hit my new threshold, I’m sick with heat exhaustion and vomiting for 6/8 hours (I drank ice water the entire time and kept an ice cold towel in my neck and STILL get heat exhaustion)

- my labs are suspiciously normal, causing no doctor to delve further. Although my wbc is always just a little elevated

- my temp hovers between 99-100.9 

- frequent urination - I just cannot hold it anymore

- currently with “subclinical hyperthyroidism” due to my gyno putting me on 120mg twice a day. Took it for about 6 weeks. No longer taking. 

- brain fog

Any suggestions on which direction to try next are welcome! I am so appreciative of this community.

15bo10w,"Presented to the ER in afib w/rvr. Resting HR 200bpm. Cardioversion returned sinus rhythm and normal resting HR. A bunch of tests later, cardiologist isn't concerned but I am having major doubts and am pretty scared. I don't trust my cardiologist (I can explain why) what should I do?
A year ago I was having very bad gastrointestinal issues, I had an ulcer in my stomach (confirmed with endoscopy). When my stomach would hurt badly, my heart would race, and I would sometimes go into afib. One morning the afib was worse than usual, and I went to the ER and my heart got up to 200bpm and they had to cardiovert me. They sent me home on Flecainide.

An echocardiogram, 30-day event monitor, and blood tests later my cardiologist isn't concerned. Threw me on Metoprolol 50mg daily to control the heart rate and told me afib isn't cureable. I only go into afib when my stomach gets upset, so I asked him about vagal afib and he said it's not really a real thing. He really has never given me the time of day and his nurse practitioner is very rude as well. His office double books appointment times, and he is always in a huge rush when I see him. I can't ever ask him questions like ""is this reversible?"", ""will I get blood clots and get strokes later in life?"", ""can I exercise?"", etc etc. I tried to slow him down last time I saw him and said ""I have some questions"" and I got one question out and as he was answering the question he opened the door and started stepping out into the hallway - he answered my question then said ""I'll see you in 6 months take care"" and closed the door. I'm a shy person at doctors offices so I didn't protest, and I am too polite to just keep rattling off questions or stop him, he is the opposite he's a ""speak up or I'm walking out the door"" kind of guy, which I can respect but I need some patience here.

This has changed my entire life, I took this event extremally seriously. I quit drinking entirely, lost 100 freaking pounds over the last year (I was extremally obese). I am now trying to finish up my progress and start exercising, and I have two vacations coming up in a month and I want to know if I'm healthy enough to have a few glasses of wine or beers with friends while I'm on vacation - but he doesn't have the time of day for me.

I called his office today, for the first time ever I really don't bother them, left a message with his nurse practitioner and said ""Hey, I've been trying to go jogging, but I keep going into afib while jogging and my stomach gets really upset, also my heart rate is 170bpm while I jog is this ok??"" and she called back and just said ""yup you're fine"".

I lack confidence in these answers - I have so many questions and concerns in my head that I really want to get out like ""how serious is this?"", ""why did I go into rvr and svt that one day?"", ""what can I do to never have to get cardioverted again?"", ""how many years might I have had afib before this without knowing it?"", ""have I had afib for so long that clots may have started to form?"", ""Is this afib just related to my weight and my gastrointestinal issues and it will go away as I keep losing weight?"", ""Will this continue forever? Will I need an ablation by the time I'm 40?"", ""Will I be on metoprolol for the rest of my life?"", ""Can I drink socially a few times a year?"", ""Can I take prescription pills like Adderall or Wellbutrin?"", ""What about other stimulants like caffeine?"", ""can I test my LDL and apo B? I was a fat pos for 10 years do I need to worry about atherosclerosis?"". I need like a solid fuckin 15-20 minutes with this guy I just want to clear my head and feel ok about what's going on. If I have afib forever ok, I can accept that, but just sit me down for a few minutes and explain that I'm not gonna go back into SVT or RVR or have to get cardioverted ever again if I follow some rules. Getting cardioverted was a little traumatic I was fully awake and everything I will do anything to not have to go through that again.

Any advice is extremally appreciated, really stressed about all this over the past year. Thank you so much for your time and for reading.

I can only look to the right, and not even straight. I'm on two paracetamol but it helps zero. This is so extremely frustrating and any random move hurts. Going to a physician or something seems like the move, but I literally can't move without pain and feel like I'd faint if I tried. An ambulance however seems like overkill, whereas a taxi seems like a risky move, especially not knowing the language and not even being sure I can figure out where to go.

- Vitiligo
- ADHD (2017)
- Neck stiffness (ongoing chronic, worsens over time)*

*Associated symptoms with Neck stiffness
- tingling in arms
- blood flow to right arm is questionable (hand can swell sometimes)

Neck stiffness presents itself at the base of the back of my neck, with accessory pain in my trap muscles and right shoulder blade.

**CURRENT STORY:**

A few days ago, I woke up with the sudden loss of homogeneity in the movement of my eyes. I simply could not focus my eyes, and it felt as if my right eye was moving on a different axis to my left eye. I got a little freaked out and chose to just go back to sleep. When I woke up again, it was normal.

However, since then I’ve had this dull forehead pressure around my brow, and it feels like there’s more pressure on my eyes in general. Moving them around is just a tiny bit more work than feels natural.  I can focus them fine, but they feel drier and weirdly, if my neck is particularly stiff, I shed a tear, as though my eye is getting irritated.

My vision is also noticeably blurrier than it was two weeks ago. But only a bit. Enough to notice, not enough for a car crash. 

Consistent dull and very mild headache too, only in the front/forehead area. Sometimes a very localised pain in the upper left area of my forehead that feels a bit sharper too. 

All of this is also met with an immense sense of lethargy, despite being on the highest dose of an ADHD stimulant, eating, drinking water and getting exercise.

I’m 26F, 5’6 and 230lbs (which I’m embarrassed about), am on a cocktail of psychiatric drugs ranging from antidepressants to antipsychotics, and I’ve never smoked. 

I have multiple food allergies which have been present for the past five years. I’m allergic to:
1. Leafy greens (no joke, I can’t eat these without getting extreme cramps/nausea/diarrhea).
2. Anything in the rose family, so apples, strawberries, cherries, etc. I will develop an immune response that is almost flu-like.
3. Gluten. Same thing as the rose family, it causes an immune response and inflammation.
4. Dairy. Lactose intolerant.
5. Broccoli. Cramps, nausea, diarrhea, rectal bleeding.

To make it even worse, I was just diagnosed with a thyroid disease today and the specialist encouraged me to change my diet. She suggested a diet consisting of leafy greens and berries…the things I’m allergic to! And that I need to avoid nightshades (potatoes, etc.) and beans, AKA the things I actually CAN eat without my body rejecting them. She also suggested no gluten or dairy, which is absolutely doable. But avoiding the few foods I’m actually able to eat, like beans and potatoes???? Ugh!

I have also seen nutritionists and gastroenterologists over the years and all of them are at a loss on what I should do. Everything good for me is bad, and everything bad for me is good, and vice versa. Never ending cycle. And the autoimmune diagnosis just made this worse.

Like what, am I supposed to be hooked to a feeding tube and fed allergen-free slop at this point?!

She told them about her pain and they also asked if she had a sore throat. She said yes. They did a strep test and it came back positive. We were actually a little shocked because she didn’t have a fever or anything. She has had strep a lot this year and even scarlet fever once this year. Dr thinks maybe she is just a carrier but decided to put her on an antibiotic anyway and then we will retest when she’s not having symptoms to see if she is just a carrier. She also prescribed miralax to get things moving because she felt some poop in her belly. Her belly pain has been on and off over the last couple days. Throat pain seems to be gone. Today she came home from summer camp and said her belly aches and her lower back was sore. I called the dr to tell them nothing has really changed after a couple doses of antibiotics. They said to just take her off of it because antibiotics can bother the tummy sometimes. She fell asleep early this evening after some Tylenol for the pain in her back and when I just checked on her she has a 102 fever.  I am trying to convince myself that this is just a weird presentation of strep where she is getting worse before she gets better. She’s had 3 doses of azithromyacin now.

I read afterwards about hantavirus and while I was careful I can’t help but think maybe she was exposed or maybe we all were. Some of her symptoms match early symptoms of hantavirus.

Rx: duloxetine (for myalgia), meclizine (for dizziness/vertigo), Ondansetron (for nausea/vomiting), sumitriptan (to abort migraines), amitriptyline (for sleep), some vitamins, and topicals for skin stuff. I take NDAIDs very often for pain but they’re OTC.


I have chronic migraines due to a concussion I got two years ago. It never healed, I still have symptoms as bad as Day 1, and it’s been two years. We’ve tried everything imaginable to treat the concussion but it seems like… I just have to give it time and hope it goes away.

My migraines use to be pretty well managed at home with things like otc NSAIDs, nausea/dizziness meds, hiding in a dark/quiet/cold room, and sleeping it off. At that point I didn’t have any prescriptions for migraines because I just honestly didn’t know there was options out there for it and as horrible as migraines are they only happen sometimes so they’re never been my chief complaint. I have migraines about once a week, lasting between a few hours and a few days. The rest if my concussion symptoms are constant and never ending, so they’ve always taken precedent.

In the past my migraines always been pretty short, intense for sure but I could count on them being gone within a day or two. But this current migraine I have just won’t quit. It’s been going strong for two whole months with no break. When it didn’t go away after a week, I called my doctor and set up an appointment. A few weeks later I was prescribed Sumaitriptan to try and abort new migraines but it didn’t help as this migraine was already set in too much, I guess. After a while with it not going away I finally caved and called my doctor - this was at the like 5-6 week mark. He confirmed that it’s a status migraine, and had me come in for a Toradol IM shot. He told me to get the shot and immediately go home, take the Sumatriptan and Benadryl, relax, and try to sleep it off. 

When that didn’t work, I went back in, now officially at that 2 month mark, and he said that he could try giving me something I would take daily/routinely to end this episode and hopefully limit the amount of episodes going forward. He’s going to verify if my insurance will cover it first because it’s quite expensive, and he’s going to discuss it with the rest of my medical team to make sure it’s the right choice. He said either Nurtec or Aimovig could be good choices for me. 

He was leaning toward the Aimovig for whatever reason but when he mentioned it was a once monthly injection I immediately asked if I would come into the office for the shot or do it at home. He confirmed I would do it at home. I think he could see in my face that that isn’t going to be a good time for me lol. 

I have a really bad fear of needles and injections. I can handle having medical providers give me injections without breaking down or anything but that’s because I can look away and think/talk about something else. Even then it causes me a lot of anxiety and is a really bad time, but I can at least successfully get the medicine. I would have a really hard time giving myself a shot. I don’t doubt it would give me an anxiety attack to be honest. I’m perfectly willing to occasionally go in for a Toradol shot or something because 1) I’m not the one injecting myself, and 2) it’s PRN so I don’t have to have that anxiety build up for a week or two leading to the day of the shot, I would go in the same day or the next day after requesting the nursing appointment. 

I think he saw that anxiety on my face and realized how seriously uncomfortable with it was, so he said that Nurtec could also be a fine choice assuming the rest of the team concurs, but it’s really hard to get insurances to cover it when the script comes from a PCP and not a neurologist or migraine specialist. So it might not be an option for me unless I’m willing to go through a really long and potentially expensive process getting established with a neurologist. I’d rather not do this as it’s expensive, time consuming, and to be frank I’m really sick of going to specialists just to watch them shrug, apologize, and say they can’t do anything for me. I know they’re just doing their job and being honest, which I really appreciate. But it’s tiring and emotionally draining to get your hopes up, go through months of getting established/doing tests, only to wind up back in the same spot.

But, if we can’t get my insurance to accept Nurtec, he says Aimovig is the best option for me. I told him that if a injection is *absolutely necessary* I will try to make it work but I would prefer pretty much any other method before a self-given injection. 

So - are there any other options or am I stuck with potentially giving myself shots?? 

Yes, I am aware that they’re auto injectors so you don’t really see the needle but honestly just watching the video of how to inject it gave me pretty bad anxiety so I don’t think I would handle actually doing it very well. Especially since you have to hold it in place for a few seconds unlike the quick pens (epipens and the like) that are nearly instant. 

In the universe’s infinite humor, my partner is a phlebotomist and I fully trust him to inject it if I am prescribed it. He’s drawn my blood before and he’s honestly really good at making people feel comfortable around needles. But I also feel bad making him help me with my health issues when he’s finally off of a long shift dealing with this crap all day at work, so I would prefer something like a pill or ODT that I can do on my own.",0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15bklct/my_doctor_wants_to_prescribe_me_aimovig/,23.0,Female,Self

Concern: Doctor said the curve looked normal and the appointment was over before I knew it. Some of the abnormal values are causing me anxiety and I can't really get ahold of him.

The main ones are FIVC and LCI. The FIVC just seems to not make any sense (really low) but it looks like that low value was recorded more than once, so not exactly a fluke? The LCI is high and I've read high can be sensitive for early lung issues.

15bjx43,"[21M] Inexperience with X-ray Results
Hi All,

Before I inquire, I am a 21 year old male, 5'10 and around 170 lbs. I exercise every day and recently decided to get X-ray's for my chest and back, to diagnose Pectus Excavatum and Scoliosis due to back discomfort and lightheadedness.

Although nothing serious was found in these regards, my doctor sent me a somewhat urgent (I may have just been shocked when reading it) message about needing to schedule an MRI because of abnormalities on my thigh/femur. 

The results listed a: 2 cm sclerotic lesion and smaller \~7mm sclerotic lesion, that they wanted to further evaluate via. MRI.

The last time I had a full body x-ray scan was over 10 years ago, so I do not have any recent records to compare the current scans to. I'm wasn't able to schedule the MRI until next month, so I have been stressed in anticipation of finding out what the issue is.

I wanted to see if this is typically a cause of concern, and if it's possible that this is significant. I know inquiring more into this may stress me out more, but I also believe it can potentially put my mind to ease. I appreciate any advice/suggestions.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15bjx43/21m_inexperience_with_xray_results/,21.0,Male,Self
15bm7gx,"Toddler has foul smelling urine, no UTI, not dehydrated. Could this be serious?
Hello. So about 2.5 weeks ago, my male toddler started having very foul smelling urine. You can smell the urine through his clothing. It doesn’t smell like normal urine. My partner agreed that it’s very unusual and it’s also very difficult to describe this smell. It’s almost a strong musky overly concentrated urine smell that’s been left to fester. 



I took him to his doctors office, the NP had me collect a urine sample. The office called and said he does not have a UTI. The NP was very dismissive of my concerns (and while I was there didn’t have a chance to smell his urine, diaper was dry and I had to collect at home to avoid a straight cath then return sample next day.) The NP suggested maybe it’s simply hot and he’s dehydrated but that’s not the case. My toddler drinks plenty of water and milk throughout the day. When he uses the potty his urine is a pale yellow color. Sometimes darker yellow, it varies. 



Since the call his UA was fine, I’ve received no further advice or suggestions. I’ve been left with this anxiety over the sudden urine smell. A few days before this started, I had to do the hemlich maneuver on him, he was choking on plastic. I know it’s a stretch but that’s the only out of ordinary thing that happened before this strange occurrence. 



When I change his diaper, some urine will dribble out of his penis, but I figured maybe it was his foreskin. He doesn’t have any other symptoms of illness. He doesn’t talk much so cannot vocalize discomfort. 



Thank you for any advice.

Another thing that I feel could be important is that I used to be kinda slim but now I have a kinda fat stomach (I'm not fat but my stomach is kinda). Could this be the reason why it's happening?

26M Dx Hypersomnia 
Medicine prescribed: solfeggio frequencies from youtube and an $850 product for cranial electrical stimulation

Hello, I suffer from a life-debilitating sleep disorder. Had a sleep study just recently and received a diagnosis of Hypersomnia, which i was told meant “we dont know the cause but you are verifiably tired” by the Doctor.


Summary:
—————

I only sleep four hours a night.
(It was recorded for 2 weeks prior to my sleep study for clarity)

This has been a vicious cycle for more than 5 years now, but to clarify i’ve always had sleeping issues from birth like sleepwalking until 14yo, comatose depth levels of sleep. 
(It could be approaching ten years if not more but my memory has just been getting worse from the huge lack of sleep.)

I am coming from a history of graveyard shift work, but faced a layoff a few months ago and have been attempting to  approach this from a day shift schedule. The sleep problems have been the same. It takes forever for me to sleep, if i do, and whenever I do, within a 24hour period, i only sleep a maximum of four hours. There are days where i get none at all and the following day is still a maximum of four hours.

The only way i was able to take the Sleep study was by a prescribed sleep-aid of xanax due to the test requiring a minimum of six hours of rest. (and it did help me get to the six hour mark thankfully)

I’ve come to this sub to ask about CES and opinions going forward.

Following the science, there have only been 2 randomized clinical trials done regarding CES (cranial electrical stimulation) specifically for insomnia;

one from 1940, and the other in 2012, using the exact product this doctor is wanting me to rent from them:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493135/

Although it is an “FDA approved” product, the summary of one very old and one more modern RCT do not provide evidence supporting the efficacy of CES for decreasing the symptoms of insomnia compared to usual care.

Upon reading this, I’m worried I have a doctor who is just trying to get a dollar out of me rather than help me at all try to sleep.

To steel-man the doctors position, in the case of conditioned insomnia, its best to retrain the brain rather than risk medical dependency. I’m 100% for any solution, whether it requires a machine to zap my ears or to listen to a certain hz, i just want help.

But if my doctor doesnt know the cause, and he see’s data showing I’m barley operating through exhaustion, would your recommendation be to spend 800 USD on a machine and check back in another month? (That studies show offer no results for insomnia)

The only positive thing to losing the job was to finally work on my sleep issues and the only help im getting feels like a scam.

15bi04i,"F25 - swelling in lower abdomen, especially left side (link to pic in post)
Pic link: https://imgur.com/a/S6rWLFv

Hey yall, thanks so much in advance for your help! I’m posting this for my fiancée who has (finally) agreed to seek some medical help with this lol, but I wanted to post here in the meantime to see if I can get some thoughts/advice for her before going to OBGYN.

So essentially, my fiancée has been having to deal with this abdominal swelling to some degree for at least three years now. It stays pretty constant in terms of severity, although fluctuates slightly at times. Always worse on her left side than her right (note the increase of swelling on the right side of her stomach in the picture).

Other related symptoms/details worth noting:

- endometriosis runs on both sides of her family, with most women on her mom’s side ending up needing hysterectomies after their second child (we have no kids yet but want two)

- lots of IBS-related symptoms — constipation, malabsorption probably being the two biggest ones

- very frequent and somewhat drastic changes to her menstrual cycle — she said she experiences a notable change in period probably every 6 months or so

- I think her immune system has been weakening over time recently, but historically she’s always had a very strong immune system

- swelling seems to be at least partially triggered by gluten (she may just have a sensitivity to gluten in general, swelling/other issues aside)

- no pain or discomfort during sex — that seems to be one of the bigger endo symptoms that she’s missing

- she lives a very active lifestyle — multiple gym workouts a week and trains for 10ks/half marathons — but her body has been having a hard time recovering from training recently, especially compared to this time last year (prolonged exhaustion, soreness, plateauing/regressing in performance, etc)

- she says she’s been experiencing brain fog as well

- she eats a good, clean diet for the most part — tracks macros almost daily as part of training

Based on Google research and no medical knowledge whatsoever, I’m thinking it’s probably endometriosis-related at least in part.

15bngen,"Stronf tightness and pressure in my chest and feeling vibrations at night
Hi all, i am a female, 31 years old, 5,5 and around 16 stone.

For the last few months i have been experiencing a crushing/tightening in my chest at night time, usually just before i go to sleep, i can last up to 20 minutes, i also feel vibrations like the bed is shaking and sometimes also hear a birring noise like a plane flying over the house.

I have visitee my doctor about this and he suggested it could be allergies/athsma (i have had a history of athsma but improved in later years) i have a pump now and take antihistamines but this hasnt helped. Could anyone shed any light onto what this may be, i have no issues with this during the day and only at night time.

15bj7qc,"19M - Dealing with mild headaches, a hot forehead, and high heartrate. Help?
- Mild headache that feels more like pulsing/pressure than pain, and doesn't debilitate me when it happens; they may make me slightly dizzy at times, but nothing that puts me down on the ground or anything like that. The headache occurs around my forehead area, and it comes and goes.


- Occasional itching/tingling in legs and arms (mainly legs), along with rarer, mild aching (mainly in the legs). The itching goes away with a scratch, thankfully, and the aching disappears quickly after appearing, usually after I sit down and let my limbs rest.


- A hot forehead, though it comes and goes like the headaches. I don't think I have any other signs of a fever, though.


- Potentially increased heartrate? I can feel my heart beat with my hand while at rest, and my arms are moving/shaking slightly with the heartbeat.


- Otherwise, I feel fine, and can get around and think normally. No tiredness and no confused thoughts/speech, though I have been pretty anxious for the whole time I've had these symptoms; that could be due to me not knowing what these symptoms are, and my brain going to the worst places like a heart attack, stroke or rabies.


- I've dealt with these symptoms for around two-three weeks, along with constipation that was cured with Restoralax, mild nausea (of the ""gross feeling in throat"" kind), and stomachaches; the latter two are gone. I may have also had increased saliva and/or dysphagia/difficulty swallowing, though that may have been caused by anxiety. That symptom's disappeared as well for the most part.


- A month before the last two-three weeks, I also had headaches, a fever/hot forehead, and constipation, but they went away on their own in relatively short time (curing my constipation with Restoralax may have helped), and I felt fine until these recent weeks started.


- I did both a blood test and brain X-Ray scan; the brainscan was normal, and so was the blood test besides a slightly low amount of Vitamin D.


I'm happy I've lasted so long without things getting worse, and my fears of rabies are mostly gone since rabies is way more fast-acting afaik, but I'm still worried about what this could all mean.

i am 18F. for the past 2-3 days, i’ve been having a cold?flu? with symptoms like mild fever, sore throat, runny nose, chills, body aches, headaches and sneezing. i’ve been taking nurofen, lozenges, throat sprays and medications to stop my runny nose.

last night, my sore throat got very bad despite it being very mild the past two days, and i could see my throat was very red and inflamed. i had to use multiple methods to make it less pain to be able to sleep. my mild fever also rose this morning. basically, i felt like i was getting worse as every symptom listed above were becoming stronger. i saw a doctor for this, and he told me to keep taking the current meds i have, but he also prescribed me moxiclav? i thought it was strange but i took one anyways because of how terrible i felt and because i trusted my doctor to an extent. i went to google online and it confirmed my doubts because i’m aware colds and the flu are caused by viruses. and i also know that taking antibiotics unnecessarily can do more harm than good.

15bjkc9,"Is there any possible risks associated with Narcan?
For starters, I know no one can confirm/deny anything for me based on just this text post. I know that labs and exact numbers and results would be helpful, but I don’t have any of that on me. I’m just simply looking for educated opinions. A “try researching this” suggestion could be useful or any kind of pointing me in any direction. I just don’t know where to go with any of this information, something just doesn’t feel right to me.

My boyfriend (40M) struggled with drug addiction for most of his adult life. It would mainly switch off between IV heroin and crack. He had a number of health issues related to this. Mainly MRSA several times, and I’m sure the crack did a number on his heart.

Fast forward to the end of 2021/ beginning of 2022. This is when his drug use took a complete and total turn. For the year or so leading up to this he was mainly using opiates, which I believe was fentanyl. Prior to this period of time he had pretty “standard” opiate use symptoms- nodding off, tired, unresponsive, overdosing, etc. Then all of a sudden somewhere in this time frame these “episodes” completely changed.

Almost immediately after shooting up, he’d completely lose his mind. He’d enter what I believed to be psychosis and have little to no memories of the hours following. He would be screaming at the top of his lungs in tongues, he would be punching walls and breaking things, he’d be rolling around on the floor kicking anything in his way and walking up the walls with his legs, he’d be sprinting around room to room. I’d immediately try to take all of the paraphernalia away from him that way it’d already be gone and disposed of by the time he’d come to again, and he’d attacked me while doing so. This is the MOST out of character thing. He’d be completely pouring sweat, eyes wide, heart rate and BP obviously sky rocketing though I don’t have exact numbers for anything. This would last for hours, I’d say maybe 4? And it’s not like he was doing some insane amount- maybe 0.1-0.2 grams at a time. This is not a lot at all for someone with his history. 

Now we lived in an apartment so 911 would almost always get called. 9/10 he would miraculously snap out of it as soon as cops are in his face. He’d have no memory of what happened, but enough sense to refuse medical care and send them on their way. Sometimes it would resume as soon they leave. So to clarify, in these instances he would come out of this trance on his own- whether it be with police presence or just with time. He would never lose consciousness and he would never be narcanned. In a few hours he would be exactly to himself again. These are the times that I was there.

Now there was one time in February 2022 where he did not snap out of it when police arrived. He was still out of control and thrashing. They restrained him on a stretcher and put him in an ambulance on the way to the hospital. I was right behind the ambulance. When I got to the hospital they told me that they narcanned him (not sure if before or at the hospital) and it was right around that point that he was having trouble breathing and they intubated him. He was on a ventilator for about 16 hours and recovered well and quickly.

There was seemingly absolutely no difference in this time from his actions than any other. I had no idea he’d end up on life support. I thought he’d just calm down like he always did. It just always struck me as odd that he started going downhill AFTER they narcanned him.

I’ve struggled with opiate addiction as well. I’ve been narcanned, but only when unresponsive or not breathing. I’ve always quickly come to, almost with aggression and paranoia. Like a super quick adrenaline rush that started up my heart again.

In October 2022, the same thing happened. He was having one of these episodes and did not snap out of it when police arrived. They put him in the ambulance and narcanned him. He stopped breathing when he got to the hospital and they did two rounds of chest compressions and put him on a ventilator. They told me he would be okay and they’d likely take him off it the next day.

Several days later they diagnosed him with an anoxic brain injury and he was put on hospice care. He passed away 2 1/2 weeks after he overdosed and thus began my hell on earth.

People always say there’s no harm in narcanning someone. Is that true? It just seems like he always stopped breathing AFTER being hit with it. Typically you are narcanned when your heart rate is so low or gone and it brings it back. Is it possible that since his was already so high, the dose of narcan skyrocketed it and caused him to go into cardiac arrest? I just don’t know what was so different about this time",5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15bjkc9/is_there_any_possible_risks_associated_with_narcan/,40.0,Male,Self

This is embarrassing to post but i need some serious advice.  Also i am not  diagnosed with anything but  i thought i’d get an opinion.  I’m not sure what to do or what to say even but i need advice. So i’ve been to urgent care and my new pediatrician doctor and they are giving me more tests and more tests and everything keeps on coming back fine. I went to an urgent care doctor yesterday because i was having debilitating headaches to the point where i felt like i was going to pass out. But before the urgent care doctor, an er doctor did a pelvic exam, a regular ultrasound of my ovaries, and did a transvaginal ultrasound  and it came back fine. They did a full body CT scan and that came back fine. But i know something is up. Especially since my belly is so bloated and i lost about 10 pounds last week. It’s hard for me to do things because i am extremely weak and no doctors are helping me. All my blood and urine tests keep on coming back fine. I was also sexually active when i was younger and never had the hpv shot before. Which is why i was afarid that i had cervical issues. And all my doctors are telling me i’m fine but i know something is wrong. Then  I told the urgent care doctors about all my symptoms and she recommended that i see an oncologist.

 abnormal vaginal bleeding

weakness

cramping after peeing 

Back pain

Chest pain 

faintness 

extreme headaches 

bone pain

I was recommended by the urgent care doctor to do a cervical biopsy to test for cervical cancer. Since it does run in our family.  ALL my blood tests came back normal. Expect i do have a little bit of aniema and my ast levels were a bit low which is normal. It makes me sad.  Everyday i feel like i’m getting worse. And i’m only 17.

15bkqbx,"37M - Have had a fever/virus for over 2 weeks!
So i've had some sort of virus now for 2 weeks and im starting to worry. It's clearly a virus as my son brought it home from daycare and me and my wife got sick within 2-3 days of each other.

Started out as sore throat, with 1 swollen tonsil along with body-aches and chills/fever. Progressed into head stuff (Congestion/facial pain) and then into chest cough/mucus. My wife progressed similarly.

However she's not running a fever anymore (Still has some cough) but all my symptoms have gone away except for EXTREME tiredness/slight body aches and a low grade fever (around 99.1-99.6 throughout the afternoon). My main worry is just how weak/tired I feel even with minor activities.

FWIW I saw the doctor around 2-3 days after the illness started (so about 2 weeks ago) and saw a doctor 2 days ago. They gave me steroids for the tonsil swelling (It's still swollen but doesn't hurt) but did tons of tests. NO covid (i've had 4 covid tests), no flu/mono/strep throat either.

CBC looks good. But I did see my WBC jumped from 7.2-9.8 (Still technically under range) and my immature granulocytes went from .01 to 1.6 (%) and .01 to .15 (absolute). Everything else was fine though. (The CBC results are a week apart fwiw, 7/15 - 7/24)

I guess my worry is 2-fold:

1. Is it normal for immature grans to jump up with a virus? I thought that only happened with like cancer/leukemia
2. Should a virus be hanging on this long? I mean my symptoms have gone away but I feel completely drained. AND im still running a low grade fever and generally just feel not great.
3. Is a lingering low grade fever normal?

Nurses and doctor both said yeah it's a little long for a virus to last thing long but I guess something has been going around that's lasting weeks.

I’ve been dealing with sciatic pain for a little over a year. I’m 29.  I have localized pain right above my left butt check that feels like a knife stabbed in my back, pins and needles through the thigh and back of the thigh and for the most part completely numb from the knee down, the bottom of my foot is constantly tingling. I sometimes have the urge to pop my hips that it brings me to tears and after a few hours at work my knee starts to buckle when I walk and my foot feels almost as if it’s asleep and it causes a limp. I have a hard time riding in a car for longer than an hour.  All of this is on the left side I have no pain on the right. I started going to the chiropractor which took care of it for a couple of months, and then I started getting a deep pain in the center of my back. It hurts to the touch and feels like a deep bruise but there’s not discoloration although you can occasionally see the muscles swollen. At this point I started seeing an orthopedic doctor, I’ve failed straight leg, reflex test and etc on my left side, right side is fine. My X-ray showed nothing significant in that spot. About a week ago something really flared up my sciatic and I found myself rolling on the floor in pain, I saw the chiropractor, he was unable to adjust my left side. I had a few days off of work after that appointment and the day I went back two hours in my knee buckled, it felt like someone stabbed a knife into my lower back, and I ended up going to the er later in the day because I felt numb around my pelvic area and the pain in my lower back was so severe after a year I just couldn’t stand it anymore, my mri came back clear, and I was given steroids. I’m just at a loss this isn’t something I’ve ever dealt with, I don’t understand how I can be in such severe pain but all my test are coming back normal, I’m constantly battling my insurance to pay for more test and I’m at a loss at what to do next.

A couple days later, the stiffness in my right leg had decreased, only occurring in episodes. I noticed that my wrists were feeling weak, especially my left. I attributed it to my summer job and using grippers too frequently. A few more days after that, the feeling in my wrists has become more painful, especially upon flexing, and spread to my arms. I am having minor sharp pains in my arms and my right leg. My fingers feel stiff, and I feel that my grip on things is weakening. My neck and shoulders are also tight, and I am having a slight tension headache. The twitching has continued throughout, in all parts of the body. 

with all due respect to her profession, I don't think this neurologist did her job properly. I drove 3 hours to see the only pediatric neurologist in my area, only for 5< minutes of clinical exam before making the conclusion that I'm fine. I suffer from health anxiety, and now I feel that is a reason for doctors to not take me seriously. furthermore, I'm leaving for college in around three weeks, and I would like this issue resolved before I leave. should I call the neurologist back to ask for an EMG? 

finally, if any doctors here have any ideas as to what this can be, please do share. thank you all. ",10,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15bgiat/neurological_concerns_need_advice_17m/,17.0,Male,Self

15blj34,"[19M] acid pain after colectomy
In early 2022 I had a colectomy for colitis, over the next few months I had a few surgeries to reconnect the remaining intestines, when I got the final surgery to remove the ileostomy bag I started to have a very bad pain whenever I use the bathroom.

I told the surgeon and since I also reported occasional blood, she did a scope, didn’t see anything. She put me on cholestyramine to reduce the bile. it actually helps, but not all the way.

A few months ago I got a new gastro doctor since I am now a adult but no matter what I say he doesn’t seem to understand, doing a bunch of tests for remaining inflammations, they haven’t seen anything. He tried another medicine colesevelam I believe since pills are less of a hassle than the powder. But that didn’t work as well. I have a scope next month

So now that you have the background, is there anything I should do to help the bile seeping into my stool, there are some days where I can’t do anything because of the pain. I’m not looking for a magic cure but any tips would help

15bm7yn,"Oral Herpes diagnosis
The picture of my exes mouth will be on the comment section. 

My ex gf and I recently fucked, now she’s having what she presumes to be an type 1 herpes outbreak and kind of blames me for it as she believes I catch it from another girl. I did make out with several girls but I don’t believe that I transmitted this to my ex. Plus, even if it is herpes, couldn’t she had catch it in the past but have the blisters now? I’m planning to go to the doctor tomorrow morning to run a blood test to see If I had the virus, does that make sense? Cause I know almost everyone has it so it would prove I’m the one she catch it from.",1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/15bm7yn/oral_herpes_diagnosis/,,Not Disclosed,Self
