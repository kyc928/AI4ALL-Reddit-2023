The cancer has metastasized and spread throughout her body. She was told in February that she only had a life expectancy of three months, but she has made it past that.\n\n About a week and half ago, she fell and broke her arm. The cancer is in her bones, so it shattered very easily. She went to hospital after that and stayed there for a few days. Naturally, she was in a lot of pain, both from the cancer and the broken arm. But here's the thing: mentally she has always been completely fine. Throughrout all of this she has been perfectly coherent and aware. I spoke to her 4 or 5 days ago on the phone. She was still in pain, but she was laughing and joking with me. That was the last time I spoke to her. I called her again the next day and the day after that, no answer. So I go visit to make sure she's okay. When I get there I find out they moved her from ICU to comfort care, gav3 her morphine, and she's completely out of it.\n\n Her eyes are open, but she's not aware of where she is. Sh Once, she did look at me and smile and say my name, but that was it. She also seems to be in even more pain, crying out every couple of minutes, which has never ever happened before. This is after two days, she goes from fine to totally out it. The doctor says it might be the morphine. I come back the next day, and she's the same, more or less. She recognized me again when I came in, and kept saying my name, but that was it. There is no morphine in her at this point. The nurse claims that she might just be like this now. I go back the next day, she's asleep all day. I go back the next day after that, and her eyes are open, but she's not responding at all. Her breathing is very harsh.\n\n I just don't see how a person can decline so quickly over the span of two days, and I'm worried that they did something to her or gave something to her to make her like this.

        "context": "Mild, split-second vertigo/brain zaps as a sinus infection symptom?\nLast Thursday I came down with what I think was a sinus infection, and one of the first symptoms was a feeling of unsteadiness when I would rapidly turn my head. I developed a mild fever (never over 100.2), a sinus headache, swollen lymph nodes in my neck, and some mild sinus and chest congestion. I also woke up with night sweats but I think that\u2019s a combination of the fever, anxiety over being sick and work stuff, and medication side effects (I get them a few times a week but not usually noticeable). The fever is gone, congestion is minimal, and I don\u2019t currently have a headache, but I still get the weird feeling when I adjust my visual focus or turn my head. Is this a symptom of sinus infections or should I make an appointment? I went to urgent care and they just said to come back if symptoms persisted for a week, or if my fever/headache got a lot worse. I had a hard time describing the symptom because it\u2019s not vertigo in the classic sense of the room spinning, and it\u2019s not the painful/disabling kind of brain zaps that I had when switching SSRIs, so I wasn\u2019t sure what to call them. \n\nM28, 6\u20191 165 lbs, on paroxetine for 3+ years, on xarelto after a pulmonary embolism in October 2022.

What I experience is a buzzing sensation every 3-5 seconds on that location. The best thing I can compare it to is when you have a phone on silent mode and someone calls, and you year that buzz sound with the vibrations. I feel the vibrations but if I put a finger on, I cant feel it on my finger, so it must be on the inside? There is no pain at all, it's just very annoying and distracting. It's only on my right foot.\n\nNow, I do have health anxiety, and I have spent a lot of hours complaining to friends, to doctors and here for the most trivial things ever and I sincerely apologize for that, but I just want to know if it's something serious or if you have encountered that before yourselves or you heard someone else have it.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Mx3Zo2F",

My parents are in the medical field so I have a decent understanding. \n\nI\u2019m a gay man and I have done extensive research and have found that condoms break 30% of the time during anal intercourse. I don\u2019t see the point of the top wearing one (I\u2019m a bottom on PrEP). I read that condoms only stop the spread of HPV by 70%\u2026. So one has a chance of 30% of getting HIV and HPV (assuming not on PrEP and no Gardasil).\n\nIn the 1980s many gay and bisexual men unfortunately got HIV. This is partly due to the fact that a recently infected top has a 37.18% chance of infecting the bottom. More than 1/3! \n\nSo if many gay/bi men were getting HIV at 37.18% what is the difference at 30%. Condoms aren\u2019t that effective in anal sex. At this point 7.18% difference is negligible to me. Can anyone convince me that I should have the top use condoms based off the research I have presented?\n\nI truly don\u2019t get the point. Condoms just delay the inevitable of getting Herpes (very common in sexually active gay men), Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, and Syphilis are curable. Hep C is curable, and I am vaccinated against Hep B like most people are. I just don\u2019t get the point if I\u2019m on PrEP and condoms have a 30% fail rate in anal sex",

The tumor was discovered after a severe headache; **there were no pre-operative seizures**. However, eight months post-op (Feb 2021), he had his first-ever tonic clonic. He was put on medication, but in July 2021 (a little over a year post-op), he had back-to-back focal seizures (multiple per hour/status epilepticus). These seizures landed him in the ICU in a medically-induced coma. He came out of the situation with few complications and was placed on Lacosamide/Vimpat and Divalproex Sodium/Depakote, both of which he still takes.\n\n\n\n**HEALTH CONCERN:**\nOverall, he's been doing great since being placed on Vimpat and Depakote, but I am concerned about his nighttime movements.\n\n\n\nWhen sleeping, he experiences random rhythmic twitching in various parts of his body (fingers, feet, arms, legs, mouth, etc.). Sometimes, these movements may wake him, causing him to turn over or scratch his arm/leg/chest/whatever before drifting back to sleep. Occasionally, he may make sounds in bursts, like \"hmm, hmm, hmm\" (sorry, I'm not sure how to describe it).\n\n\n\nIf I notice these movements, I can gently tap him and say his name and the movements stop immediately. He will be completely normal, and we can have a regular conversation.\n\n\n\nThis has been happening since his last seizure in July 2021, and I brought it up to his epileptologist who recommended a sleep study. However, my husband couldn't afford to take off work during that time.\n\n\n\nTonight, it happened again. It sounded like a short, muffled laugh and when I looked at him, he was turning his neck in a twitchy-like fashion (almost like an oscillating fan that gets stuck and cannot spin properly). I tapped his shoulder and the movements stopped abruptly, and he opened his eyes. I asked him if he was okay and he said he was fine. We chatted for a moment about what I saw. He chalked it up to normal hypnotic jerks and he fell back to sleep. He was totally normal.\n\n\n\nHe and I have been together for 17 years and, to my knowledge, these movements didn't happen until AFTER his craniotomy. However, I suppose it's possible that I've just become hyperaware of his movements ever since his first seizure.\n\n\n\nSo, do these sound like seizures (despite ending so abruptly with physical contact)?",

I\u2019m starting college, it will be the first time i\u2019ll be out on my own, and I feel like it\u2019s already doomed it fail if I can\u2019t get my prescription. \nIf I plead my case and explain this all to my doctor, and apologize for lying, is it possible for me to be able to have my prescription? Or at least for him to give me another chance to stop using marijuana and then drug test me again in a few weeks or months. This post may seem dramatic but I am seriously freaking out because it could really affect my future. If there is a better subreddit to post this, please let me know. Thank you so much.",

        "context": "Lingering constant headaches after panic attack\nHello all, I am a 32M, posting from my wife\u2019s account. I\u2019ve been wanting to post for a while in search of some help, maybe somebody has experience with what I have been going through. I will try to be as concise as possible with the most relevant details but please feel free to ask questions. TW- I will be describing my panic attack. If you don\u2019t want to see all that skip to the TLDR where I will briefly summarize and get to my question. Hope that is okay. Here\u2019s my story:\n\nI had a panic attack, my first and so far only, on May 30th 2022. I was at a bachelor party and I had, had a few beers and decided to try a weed brownie. I have smoked marijuana a few times, but this was the first time I tried eating it. I proceeded to have a panic attack for the next several hours. It started with me suddenly not liking the way I was feeling and no longer wanting to feel that way but not feeling like I had any control. My thoughts started spiraling and I had intense fear. I basically thought I had broken my brain and was going to be stuck like that forever. I physically started to feel very tight in my chest, throat and jaw. My body started shivering uncontrollably. I was having this weird tingly surging from the top of my head down the back to my neck. This ebbed and flowed for the next six hours, where the panic would feel intense, start to fade, but then come back again. I was eventually able to fall asleep. When I woke the next morning, I felt okay, a little tired and drained from the experience, but otherwise okay. I went about the rest of weekend with no problems.\n\n It was probably a week or so later I started having these headaches and feeling nauseous pretty constantly. I also had this weird feeling like I wasn\u2019t myself. I felt as though I was cut off from myself like I wasn\u2019t experiencing the world normally in my own body anymore. There was this weird separation or distance, or like a muting and kind of a foggy feeling in my mind. I\u2019ve since learned that this could be derealization and isn\u2019t uncommon with panic attacks. This feeling gave me a lot of anxiety and I had further episodes of intense anxiety over the next several weeks. I wouldn\u2019t call them panic attacks because I didn\u2019t have the same physical symptoms like I did the first time, but I was very overwhelmed and fearful. Months go by\u2026 I saw medical doctors, a psychiatrist, and started seeing a therapist. I decided not to take medication but to try therapy for a while and see if that would help. Eventually the nausea went away and the anxiety lessened and the intense episodes became fewer and further in between. The derealization has also gone away. The only thing that has persisted for over a year now are the headaches. They are mild most of the time, maybe a one or two out of ten, but almost constant. Sometimes they hurt worse. It feels like a pressure inside my head and sometimes I get a mild hot flashy feeling down the back of my head and neck. \n\nTLDR - I had my first and only panic attack over a year ago. I had some symptoms afterwards that all eventually went away except for this constant mild headache. I never really had headaches before so it seems tied to the panic attack. I don\u2019t think they are tension headaches and I don\u2019t think they are psychosomatic, but I\u2019m not ruling it out I guess. I have also had some issues with sleep following the panic attack. I had some sleep anxiety that was sporadic where I had a hard time falling asleep. And there have been stints of time where I feel as though I am not getting deep sleep.

During my meeting with employee health, I was prescribed HIV post-exposure prophylaxis and doxycyline for the syphilis exposure. \r  \n\r  \nI was told that HSV transmission is not really a risk with needlestick injuries, so I will not be tested for it as part of my employee health followups. They advised me to arrange for my own testing via my PCP if I was concerned.\r  \n\r  \nI started the doxycycline 8 days ago. Within the past 3 days or so, I have started to notice itching in my genital and anal regions, and have found a few small fissures/cuts on my labia that sting when I shower. I know that antibiotics can lead to yeast infections and am wondering if that's possibly what's happening, but given the situation I'm anxious that it could be something else (like a herpes outbreak?). I have not noticed any unusual discharge, bumps, or ulcers, and have not had any flu-like symptoms.\r  \n\r  \nI understand that HIV transmission risk from this type of injury is quite low, that it will be months before labs will show meaningful results re: HIV seroconversion, and that syphilis is curable. However, I'm still left with a lot of questions - my employee health appointment was a whirlwhind and I felt too embarrassed at the time to ask thorough follow-up questions. I'm still left wondering:\r  \n\r  \n\\* Should I truly not be worried about HSV transmission? Would it be worth pursuing followups given the symptoms I am having?\r  \n\\* What precautions should I be taking during this period? I am in a long-term relationship and feel absolutely awful about the potential of putting my (32M) partner at any risk.\r  \n\\* If I test negative for everything at my 6 month appointment, should I feel \"in the clear\"?\r  \n\r  \nI apologize if this is long-winded or any of these questions are stupid, the situation has got my mind spinning and this is not an area I have experience with.",

When she was first born, she was diagnosed with respiratory distress syndrome which we were told was a common side effect of early delivery via this method. She was transferred to the NICU for 2 days and was given high flow oxygen. She was then discharged however her respiratory rate remained high and, as a result, she was given a 5 day dose of antibiotics as doctors suspected sepsis. The thought was that her respiratory rate would calm down (at this point it was in the 70s) once she finished the course of antibiotics. \n\nAt the same time, she was given a chest x ray to check for potential pneumothorax, had blood gas checked, had an echo, full bloods and all of this showed no infection markers and normal CRP. The hospital was happy to discharge us after 6 days as her respiratory rate returned to a normal level. \n\nHowever last week we noticed that our daughter\u2019s respiratory rate jumped up again and she was exhibiting tracheal tugging so we went to our nearest A&E department (we are based in the UK). Doctors there also performed all the above checks except for another echo and determined that there was nothing acutely wrong with our daughter. At this point she was acting normal, has never had a temperature, was eating fine and her nappy output was completely normal so we were discharged and told to see our GP. \n\nWe have an appointment booked with our GP however our daughter still has an abnormally high respiratory rate. This evening we have noticed that she has diarrhoea and is feeding more often - probably due to dehydration. \n\nAt this point we are not sure what to do because all advice is to visit your local A&E department if an infant\u2019s resp rate is higher than 60 and our daughter\u2019s is higher than that on an intermittent basis throughout the day. \n\nWhilst we await a referral to a respiratory specialist, is anyone able to shed light on what this could be and how we should be managing this at home? Each day we are unsure(and terrified) if we should be ignoring the high resp rate or taking her to hospital again but we have been told that taking her to hospital will only result in testing for anything acute so is unlikely to be helpful.",

And recently my friend asked me if I rub/wash my feet in the shower and I confidently answered that I didn\u2019t, that I only do if they\u2019re particularly dirty\u2026 then this evening our other friend said that she does go over the bottoms of her feet with the loofah - that\u2019s when I realized, that I in fact do that also? \u2026 only difference is I am high this evening and and I do tend to have \u201cepiphany\u201d type realizations when I\u2019m high but I was bit in disbelief at the fact that I confidently answered this wrong as if I had two different versions of my memories? Could it just be that I do sometimes perhaps? I\u2019ve just been self conscious about my poor memory since my pregnancy and want to know if /when I should be concerned.",

I'm prescribed hydrocodone, gabapentin and baclofen.\n1st problem; So basically those of us with chronic pain in my town are being told at every pharmacy that we can't get our pain prescribed to us due to the pharmacy not having the medication at all. 2nd problem; Just about every pharmacy here has none. 3rd problem So, I call the doctor, the doctor tells us it's a pharmacy problem and to call around and see if anyone can fill it. 4th problem; The pharmacy tells us they are out and doesn't have any idea when they will get any in, they also treat you like some kind of dealer for asking if they have pain medication, so you have to keep calling other pharmacies and do the same thing. 5th problem; People are just having to stop this suddenly and not even allowed to ween and we are just being told tuff luck basically. How is this legal?? How is this not a lawsuit? 6th problem; Weed isn't an option because its not legal in this southern town and if it shows up in a drug screen you lose your doctor all together. I get there's an epidemic and certain procedures need to be taken, but to be someone with chronic pain and nerve damage and having to stop abruptly and withdraw should be against the law. People can have seizures and other problems withdrawing. I just don't understand. I feel like the ones who need the medication are being treated worse than people who don't need it. \nI feel like if you are prescribed this and have pain and it gets taken away won't this lead to people looking for things on the street to help them? \nIf a doctor or someone can explain this to me where I better can understand it would be appreciated.\nWhat are people supposed to do that actually need the medication , just go through withdrawal?",

        "context": "Bradycardia second opinion?\nI am a 30yo female, currently 316 lbs but losing weight.  \nHistory of pulmonary hypertension, been on 2 liters of oxygen for over a year now.  \nI had a right heart catheterization done in October and was told my numbers were pretty good and completely manageable. \nAlso diagnosed with SEVER sleep apnea. My cardiologist said it's the worst case he's ever seen.\nBeen on a bipap machine since December and feel like a whole new person.\nMy cardiologist honestly hasn't seemed too concerned with actually helping me.\n\nAbout a month ago, while checking my oxygen with my oximeter, I noticed my heart rate was in the 50s.  \nI got a fitness watch back in May and after checking the heart rate history I noticed it's been getting into the 40s since then.  \nOnly at rest.  \nAs far as I can tell, I haven't had any symptoms. Not dizziness or fainting or sever chest pain or trouble breathing.  \nI've actually been feeling really good, despite having fallen into old disordered eating habits since mid April.  \nI was close to 400 lbs around the end of March and am now almost out of the 300s.\nI haven't even really NEEDED to use my oxygen for the last few months.\nI few weeks ago I went to the ER because I wasn't sure if I was having symptoms from my heart rate or because of the severe anxiety it's been causing me. They did an EKG and a chest x-ray and said both looked really good. In fact they compared the x-ray to an old one in January and said it appears my heart enlargement has improved a lot. \n\nThe next week I saw my cardiologist. I brought up my concerns about my heart rate and my disordered eating because I had read the two can be related. I've been eating about 700 to 800 calories a day and then about 1100 on the weekends.  \nMy cardiologist told me that it's great I have so much self control and that because of my age he isn't worried about my heart rate and then rushed me out of the room.  \nI am honestly having an incredible amount of anxiety about it.  \nI'm currently waiting to get a 2nd opinion but I was hoping maybe someone on here could ease my mind a little bit.  \nThank you.",
