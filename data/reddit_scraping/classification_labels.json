I recently had what appeared an ingrown hair starting to form on the base of my penis shaft. After a couple of days, the bump resembled a pimple and I popped it leading me to an urgent care visit to ensure everything was okay and rule out possible sti exposure. The doctor prescribed me an antibiotic to control infection for 10 days, which I took through yesterday. I was also tested for trich/ghon/chla and tested negative for all. \n\nA few days after the doctor, I did notice a hair growing under the skin of the irritated area and was able to easily remove most of the hair without digging into my skin. Afterwards I kept taking the antibiotic and the skin is no longer raised however I do appear to have a small lesion where the skin looks to still be healing. \n\nFast forward to yesterday, I noticed the skin still healing and decided to try applying some cortisone cream and a band aid to promote the healing.. I woke up this morning and the area seems to be worse, visibly more red and it appears another hair growing out appears to be red and also appearing as a lesion..\n\nI am slightly paranoid but just wondering if I should get a second opinion on this being related to an sti or if this looks like a continuation of irritated skin due to my hair? Lastly the initial bump started a few days after shaving. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/qtTyy3A.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/79bmj4R.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/aVeix9c.jpg",

So he prescribed the same antibiotics for another week. It\u2019s my last dose today, there are tons of improvement, no more neck pain and pain when swallowing. And so, i decided to finally touch and inspect my neck (I decided to not touch it until meds are finished because of anxiety). Tada! It\u2019s still there, its inside my neck (left side), although its smaller now and painless. Is this normal or is there a downtime for it to be gone after the medication? Will it ever go away and shrink into nothingness overtime?

Once a month since April I have been breaking out in a red, painful rash in my armpit fold just on one side of my body. I was given clobetosol cream to use twice a day for four days the first and second times I experienced the rash. The third time I was given a shot of hydrochortisone. It appears that the rash is coming back for a fourth time. I have not changed laundry detergent, deoderant, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc. and all products that I use are hypoallergenic. At past appointments my dermatologist does not seem concerned with helping me diagnose what's causing this--he said since it responds to steroids that's all he was concerned with. I am hoping to get an appointment and push for some kind of biopsy or something besides just another shot. I don't even know if it's too early to have another shot (previous shot was June 19). This is really aggravating (both because it's painful and depressing that it keeps coming back). What are some possible causes that I can investigate with my dr.?

        "context": "(25M) More than six months of diarrhea, loose stools, and nausea. I need help.\nHello, \n\nI would like to ask for your help or advice. I have never had any problems with my stomach or digestion, even though I sometimes went to the bathroom more frequently, usually due to stress, stool was normal. However, this is a different case. At the end of November 2022, one morning, I woke up with diarrhea and spent the whole day sitting on the toilet. The stool was completely watery, and I had never experienced anything like this before. The next day, I felt better, but in the following days, I still had loose and watery stools. Whenever I ate something, within a few minutes, my stomach started rumbling, and I had to go to the bathroom again. The same thing happened when I was lying flat on my bed, with an awful rumbling sensation in the upper part of my stomach the whole time.\n\nIn the following week, I also started experiencing mouth nausea and a feeling of vomiting, despite I never vomited. I woke up in the morning already feeling nauseous and had to rush to the toilet, just like before, with watery stools. I must mention that during the time these problems started, I had, and still have, psychological issues (depression, due to other matters), and at that time, I was taking a combination of antidepressants, which I changed in various ways after consulting with a psychiatrist, so I initially attributed it to that. Continuing on... In December, I underwent routine examinations with my doctor, such as blood tests and stool tests, and then I had an ultrasound, but everything was fine. However, the symptoms persisted into the new year; it was terrible, with constant nausea, a persistent feeling of vomiting in my mouth, and pain in the upper abdomen. Eventually, I went to see a gastroenterologist, where in January, they conducted all possible tests and examinations, including gastroscopy and colonoscopy, but everything came back without the slightest finding or problem.  \n\n\nOne note, the gastroscopy was incredibly difficult for me, as I constantly felt nauseous in my mouth (sensing it somewhere behind my tongue, at the beginning of my throat). I had an intense urge to vomit, and after the gastroscopy, I struggled for several weeks with significant stomach pain and diarrhea, similar to the beginning. The nausea was immense, just dreadful. A week later, I had a colonoscopy, and despite a one-day cleansing with laxatives and the like, my intestines were completely contaminated with watery stool (I saw it on the camera).\n\nTo summarize the gastrological aspect, all my results were normal, and the doctor didn't know what was wrong with me, so he prescribed some pills containing mix of: Calcium carb, Codein, Papavereni, Sacharin Albi, Miscle fiat pulvis. I took them in the morning and evening, and although they made my stool firmer, it still looked bad (yellowish color) and had a strange smell. Moreover, they caused increased nausea in my mouth. In the meantime, in April, when I had had enough of everything, I decided, with the doctor's agreement, to stop taking all antidepressants completely and cleanse my body. I felt slightly better, but it probably wasn't the cause. I was frustrated, so I made an appointment with an infectious disease specialist, and I got tested for all possible viruses, sexually transmitted diseases, and even things like HIV, hepatitis, and so on, but everything came back negative.\n\nI forgot to mention, at the end of January, I noticed (until then, I had never looked at it) that I had a terribly thick, white coating on my tongue, and it has been there for six months now. I thought it could be candidiasis, as I had previously been diagnosed with it from swabs on my penis, but this time I had swabs taken from my throat and tongue, and the finding was negative. I also read that e-coli bacteria can cause watery diarrhea, but I don't believe they would miss detecting it in my tests.\r  \n\r  \nBasically, I'm currently lost and desperate. It's not as bad as it was at the beginning, but I constantly feel either nauseous, have loose stools, or experience pain in the upper part of my stomach. It seems to me that everything I eat is processed in my stomach instantly and moves on. It's like an extremely accelerated metabolism, and I never feel emptied.  \n\r  \nThe stool is colored yellow and has an unnatural smell. No complications with the gallbladder or pancreas were found. Recently, I was examined for immunology, and milk intolerance was detected, but I don't think it had an impact on this issue. Additionally, some weakened immune cells were identified, and I have started taking Imunor. For the past few months, I have been regularly consuming probiotics and various combinations of vitamins, without success. I tried changing my diet, but it doesn't seem to have any effect. Simply put, since the end of November, something has completely changed in my digestion; my stomach feels heavy within half an hour after eating, and so on.\n\nIf you have any further questions or if there's anything else you're interested in, I'll respond to everything in the comments.\r  \n\n\nThank you for reading..\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\n\n&#x200B;",

It was a small amount, there was some partly digested food. \n\nI was checked out in the ambulance and they told me I had no serious signs of infection.

This past weekend my fatigue and body aches hit a high and I wasn't really able to do much - I had to leave a hangout with friends because moving was really sucky on my muscles, and I even went to the ER at like 3am on Saturday due to chest pain and neck pain (they suggested it was just muscle tension/aches and not cardiac or lung issues).\r  \n\r  \nThen, this morning I had my cup of coffee and went to work. Had a pretty intense BM (the kind that makes your intestines cramp). Nothing in the bowl before I went - afterwards, I look in and see some sort of string-like thing. Photo is here - [https://imgur.com/a/blROx0i](https://imgur.com/a/blROx0i) There were two of these total, but the other was like, embedded in the BM so I didn't feel comfortable getting a photo of that...possibly an oversight on my part. Worried it's like a worm or a bit of my intestinal lining?\r  \n\r  \nI see my PCP on Wednesday for a checkup, and I'm definitely going to bring it up - I just want to know what to emphasize or what else I should mention that I may not have considered.\r  \n\r  \n(Unrelated but potentially important? I've been having unusual vaginal discharge - strange odor and consistency, itching and burning every so often. I'm hoping to schedule a women's health appointment, but I'm wondering if there's a connection. TIA!)\n\n&#x200B;",

The covid symptoms I had at this point were fever, sore throat, mild cough, and body aches. I took DayQuil sometime before bed.  \nI woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. I was really tired so I sat down to pee. While I was sitting, my hands and feet suddenly got very cold. Like extremely cold, not chilly from a draft. It felt like ice was creeping up my limbs. My hearing went very muffled and my ears were ringing, my vision started to tunnel, and I was dizzy. My hands and feet were tingling. My chest felt really tight and my stomach was cramping. I managed to get up and wake up my mom (she was visiting and we ended up having to quarantine together). I told her something felt very very wrong. She called 911. I laid down. By the time the paramedics got there, those symptoms mostly had gone away and I was feeling slightly better. They took my vitals. My heart rate was a little fast, my blood pressure slightly lower than my normal but still in an okay range, I had a very low fever, and my O2 was 97. Since all of that was fine, I declined going to the hospital.  \nI've taken DayQuil many times before with no issues. However, once when I was a teenager, I took NyQuil while I was sick and something really similar happened. I went to the bathroom, suddenly felt really off (ears muffled and ringing, nauseated, cold and tingly, tunnel vision), got up and started walking back to my bedroom and fainted.  \nI always assumed then I had a bad reaction to something in the NyQuil, so I only ever took just DayQuil after that. Am I allergic to something? Is something messing with my breathing, blood pressure, or blood sugar levels?

I went to the airport,entered the plane. When the pilot announced takeoff, I suddenly couldn't breathe properly. I had travelled with plane 7-8 times, so this was a first to me. I lost control of myself and told the hostess that I wanted to get off the plane immediately. They first asked if there was a doctor among the passengers, luckily, there was one, unlucky for me, she couldn't help me. I grabbed my luggage and rushed outside the airport, but i was still gasping. Went to the train, still gasping. I was gasping the whole 1 hour ride. I didn't want to go home, asked my friend if I could stay over, she agreed. I was still gasping and at that point, it was fucking annoying. I stayed there for 3 days, had a panic attack on the second day of my visit, felt fucking ashamed that I was weak and troubled my friend. I left after that day, took a bus, still gasping. I was about to collapse on my way to home, but I told myself that if I make it to the house,it'll be okay. It wasn't okay at all. I realized that I can't even go outside anymore. I've been staying at home for 2 weeks now,and it feels fucking awful,like a new kind of low.

The constant tinnitus is in both ears, though the left ear is often louder and sometimes has an additional tone.\n\n**Details about the pulsatile tinnitus:** The tinnitus is usually constant, but becomes pulsatile when I:\n\n* **Bend over** \\- I'll get about 5 seconds of pulse-synchronous whooshing in both ears. It's not a low-pitched ultrasound noise, it's like my hissing tinnitus pulsing along to my heart (ssssSSSSsssSSSssSSSsssSSS)\n* **Stand up quickly** \\- Again, about 5 seconds of pulse-synchronous whooshing in both ears\n* **Turn my head all the way to the right** \\- Same, about 5 seconds of the whooshing\n\nIf I maintain the positions above, after the 5-ish seconds, the pulsing stops and the tinnitus hisses normally, non-pulsatile. If I'm upset, it can take longer.\n\nOther times it is pulsatile is doing hard cardio **exercise**... this is when it pulses the most, I hear 3-5 seconds of whooshing (both ears) on every other exhale when my heart rate is raised and pumping hard. Otherwise, I feel GREAT when I exercise, my heart rate recovers quickly when I stop, no headaches or weakness, etc.\n\nSometimes, I hear the pulsing inside my tinnitus when I first wake up in the morning, or when I wake up from a vivid dream. This can sometimes take a little while to calm down and is sometimes louder, or only, in the left ear.\n\nThe constant tinnitus is extremely somatic. I can make it louder by turning my head to the right, bending my neck all the way back, pushing on my forehead, jutting my jaw out, etc. I can even 'fake' the exact sound it makes when it's actually pulse-synchronous by doing these movements... the sound is the same.\n\n**The weirdest thing:** during the times the tinnitus is pulsing, I can STOP the pulsing by closing my teeth together. I CANNOT stop the pulsing by pressing anywhere on my neck or throat (I know that's a common test for vascular PT)  I also cannot make a recording of the pulsing, which tells me it is probably a subjective noise and not 'real'.\n\n**Duration of Complaint:** 2-3 years, I don't know exactly, but it's been going on for quite a long time.\n\n**Factors to Consider:** I have a history of going to air shows and concerts without ear protection. I also used to work wedding receptions. For the last several years I have been using AirPods on my 6-7 mile daily walks, and I definitely had the music up way too loud to hear over traffic/outside noise. I know this is why I have the constant tinnitus. What I don't understand is why it is sometimes pulsatile. I protect my hearing now.\n\n**Tests I have had:**\n\n* **Brain MRI, with and without contrast, with IAC protocol:** totally clear and 'normal'\n* **Blood tests:** not anemic, liver and kidney function fine, thyroid levels are normal. Vitamin levels were not tested.\n* **Blood Pressure:** runs low if anything, has never been elevated when measured\n* **Hearing Test:** All thresholds normal, symmetrical hearing, including some extended high frequencies tested\n* **LDL/Tympanometry:** Normal LDLs and normal pressures\n* **Vestibular tests:** found a slight unilateral hypofunction on the RIGHT side, which is my 'better' tinnitus ear.. test was done to diagnose 24/7 rocking dizziness for a few months post-COVID infection. I've since 'compensated' for this and no longer feel dizzy.\n* **Chest CTA/EKG/Echocardiogram:** These were done last month because of a bad septic pneumonia infection, not because of the pulsatile tinnitus, but everything was perfect so I'm including it here just to mention that there probably isn't a cardiac concern.\n* **Eye Exam:** included digital images of my optic nerves, no papilledema seen\n\nI never cared about the noise before until I started being anxious about it, but now it causes me a great deal of anxiety and I listen to it constantly. I feel like I can habituate to it again if I could remove the anxiety that something is really wrong, since Googling 'pulsatile tinnitus' leads you down some scary rabbit holes, which is why I started seeking a doctor to begin with.\n\nI've been seeing an ENT/Neurotologist specialist, who I thought would be the best person for this due to his hyper-specialty but he seems unconcerned about my specific symptoms? I had to push for even the standard contrast brain MRI. He thinks if my PT was anything super concerning it would only ever appear in one ear and would be a more constant 24/7 thing.\n\nI think all of you doctors on here are so generous with your time and expertise, and I'm hoping you can give me some basic advice... **with my specific symptoms should I just put this to rest, or should I be seeking more scans ( brain MRA or carotid ultrasound?) And how urgently should I be seeking this out?**\n\n**Major Concerns:** a dural arteriovenous fistula, carotid cavernous fistula, or an aneurysm. I know the scan that I had wouldn't be able to fully diagnose those things, but would it at least raise any red flags that would give my doctor reason for further testing?\n\nI'm really, really struggling with the anxiety. It's led me to restart Prozac after saying, years ago, that I'd never go back on another SSRI.",

But when I was 15 I took 47 coricidin cough and cold pills and was not breathing by the time EMS arrived. I was intubated for about three weeks and once I began being able to breathe on my own it was clear I was in some form of psychosis. I was ripping IV's out, biting nurses, running down the halls and a lot more crazy shit. My dad recorded some of these breakouts and its actually horrifying to see because for me it is all black. I don't remember any of it. I simply took the pills and woke up 2 months later in a mental hospital confused as shit. I believe I had dextromethorphan toxicity. Anyway fast forward 6 months and I had my first seizure. I have grand Mal seizures where I full on flop. They usually last about 2 minutes and my Husband (he saw my first seizure and pretty much every one since then) says that before I start full on seizing I become real quiet and look up to my left. After doing all of the tests (sleep test, EEG & MRI) my neurologist explain to me that there was a lesion in my brain with secretions firing off and if they fire off at the right time I have a seizure. Then more recently I had a newer MRI done where my neurologist said there was only a tiny possible lesion? I dont understand how it would get smaller? I still have seizures if I do not take my medication. I actually think I have more now because if I miss one dose Ill have a seizure, whereas as a teenager I was shit about taking my medications and did not have near as many seizures. \n\nSo my questions is could my lesion be shrinking and if so would my seizures stop?

I am writing this post as recently it has been getting worse and she is not able to handle it any longer (both physically and mentally), and seems like no doctor so far has been able to help us. It started as sporadic events (once every few days) that procured an itching feeling in what seem like random parts of the body. Recently, these events have become more and more frequent, up to a few times a day, which we have been calling \"crisis\". During these crisis, my mom feels a pungent painful itching feeling that puts her through a lot of pain and gives her no peace, as a consequence she gets quickly agitated, her breathing gets faster and she gets what looks like a panic attack. The itching feeling currently seems to be on her legs most times, but it can move throughout her legs and body during one single crisis. In addition, it seems like in the past few weeks she also has a general constant overall itching feeling all over the body at all times in addition to these events, which is not as bad as the crisis, but is still bothering her.\n\nSo far, there seems to be no cream or medicine that alleviates her symptoms or stops the crisis whatsoever.\n\nWhen she takes showers, she can only use cold water, as warm water makes her itching worse and at times even start the itching. Taking cold showers used to be a way to make her feel better, but now it is not even an option as things got worse.\n\nMy mom is overall healthy, she has always maintained a very healthy lifestyle, she eats well, she is physically active, she does not smoke and does not abuse alcohol (just a glass of wine every other day). No recreational drugs of any kind. She works as a flight attendant, thus she is often flying internationally and as a consequence her sleeping schedule is not perfect, but she has managed to live her life balanced as this has been her job for 25+ years. She has Factor V Leiden received from both parents, which to my understanding causes her blood to coagulate. She takes heparin for this problem, especially when traveling, and we believe that Factor V Leiden has most likely been the cause to many miscarriage. She has been pregnant to full-term three times, I am the only one that has survived. Around 8-10 years ago she had a uterine fibroid removed of around 6/7cm. Last year, she had a melanoma on the back of her arm, which has been successfully removed.\n\nShe has been visiting several doctors about the itching problem, and no one seems to be able to identify a cause for this problem, and no one is able to tell us how to alleviate her pain in the meantime.\n\nShe has seen several dermatologists. Most of them said it might be dry skin (which personally seemed strange), so they prescribed her some moisturizing cream, but that has not helped at all. Other dermatologists said it might be allergies to some ingredients in shampoo or soap, so they advised her to switch to more neutral brands and schedule an appointment with an allergist.\n\nSo, we went to several allergists. The allergists made her do a prick test, as well as other tests such allergy test to combination of substances, and allergy DNA testing. Everything came back negative, except the DNA test said she might be subject now or in the future to celiac disease or intolerance to gluten, but the other tests showed that currently she is not affected by gluten.\n\nShe has tried several types of diets according to what some physicians recommended. Each diet lasted for the duration of 6 months each, to understand if the allergy test did not produce a good outcome. She firstly tried to avoid gluten for 6 months, then avoided lactose, then avoided everything derived from cows (including beef and milk etc.). Nothing made a difference.\n\nIn the meantime, allergists have prescribed antihistamine to take during her \"crisis\", but it seems like these are not alleviating any symptoms. She feels a bit of relief abound 1h/1h30m after she takes the antihistamine, which according to the doctor should be almost instant.\n\nShe had her blood work done with a lot of parameters tested (also for liver and kidneys), and nothing is out of place. She also had an all-body \"everything ultrasound\" taken, which also checked in detailed her liver and her kidneys. Everything is fine (even perfect), nothing abnormal.\n\nShe also visited a neurologist, but the doctor excluded any associations with that field. \n\nWe have hit a wall, we do not know what to do. I am not looking for a diagnosis, I am looking for a piece of advice: what to do, who we should talk to. Nothing seems to help my mom feel relief from this pungent painful itching. Please let me know if I should provide further details. \n\nI thank you all for your time.",

During some of the other tests they found the genetic marker that my family may be predisposed to getting cancer. So the genetics doctor recommended my sister and I to get tested. My sister (40) she was able to get her test booked no problem.  \n\nMy current doctor has been on mat leave so I was assigned another doctor. I literally just don't know what to do or if what my doctor is doing is correct. I went in with a list of issues I wanted to look at, told scheduling the list. I'll spare the details essentially I was told to get out of my first appointment because my 10 minutes had been up and they couldnt spare any additional time... I had to wait almost 2 hours to see them for 10 minutes. I barely scratched my requests and to see the doctor for everything I had to book 4 visits.... \n\n- My genetics apparently was denied for testing. I finally got the doctor to send the request on visit 3, told they will call for test, I received no calls and today on my 4th visit they said it got denied despite the letter requesting i get testing as its beneficial for my mother and my family has history of lung, breast, prostate and leukemia. \n\n- told to see another doctor for a new trigger in my finger\n\n- told I don't need my testosterone checked. I requested because I've also had an issue with feeling tired, did allll the other tests 10 years ago and just gave up, read somewhere it could be low T and I've never tested it.\n\n- I did get my ecocardiogram because I have two murmurs but I got two results. After 2nd visit to this doctor, they sent me for the ecg and on my 3rd visit said it came back good. Today on my fourth visit was told I have a slow heart rate of about 56. So makes me wonder what they were looking at the last visit. \n\nSo my question is, can doctors deny a request for tests? Or is it the genetics team that denied the test. Or option 3 which I think is the correct one, my doctor thinks anyone under 40 is healthy and won't send for any tests. \n\nShe mentioned it several times and it took 3 appointments just to get the genetics requested for them to not call me, show up on the 4th and be like oh? Did you hear they denied the test.\n\nAny info will help! Thank you",

He had a fever, cough, drooling, runny nose, and lethargy- UCC deemed allergies and set him up with a visit for his PCP a few days later to see how he was doing.

He also got bit at daycare on the chin, I called his physician who said that since he is UTD on his tetanus and currently on an antibiotic (it wasn\u2019t bad enough to require stitches) that he didn\u2019t need to be brought in and that they would check him out at his recheck this upcoming Friday.\n\nStarting yesterday he began getting small abrasions on his lips.

He\u2019s positive for HFM and still has a lot of fluid in his ear. Nothing was said about his respiratory except to keep up the robitussin and Claritin. His grandma took him to the doctor and stated there\u2019s nothing they can give for HFM and it just needs to run it\u2019s course. The doctor stated to push fluids as he already has blisters in his mouth and may not want to eat due to them. \n\nIs there anything I can do to provide comfort for him?",

Please let me know if I don\u2019t cover any relevant info. \n\n\nMe: 30\u2019s F, 5\u201910\u201d, 285 lbs. Retail worker. I was walking 5+ miles a day at work with no issues prior to this incident. \n\n\nIncident: While at work I was using a hydraulic lift cart to load merchandise into a customers vehicle. The merchandise was about 200lbs. The cart has a flat bed and a handle at the back for steering and the bed raises/lowers with a foot pump. \n\n\nThe customer stopped halfway backed in and was trying to speak to me. I locked the cart and stepped off the curb to hear him. While speaking to him I heard a noise, almost simultaneously he said \u201coh shit lookout\u201d and I felt something slam into my shin and land on my foot. \n\n\nThe cart had rolled off the 6-8inch curb, tilted forward and launched the 200lbs box into/onto my foot. The cart was elevated so this box fell about 3 feet. \n\n\nThe customer had to help me get the box off my foot and when I attempted to walk my leg buckled and I sort of kneel fell. \n\n\n\nThe injury:\nI was wearing composite toe work boots so the arch of my foot ended up taking the brunt of the impact. Immediately my ankle swelled but the bruising was fairly minor. It hurt to walk, specifically it hurt to go from toe to heel in a normal walking motion. \n\n\nI went to an urgent care the day after (there were difficulties getting paperwork from them). They did x rays and identified a minor fracture of the medial malleolus and put me in a walking boot.  I attempted to return to work in the boot but the pain was awful and not helped by OTC pain relief. \n\n\nThis occurred about four months ago and I am still dealing with pain and a very loud clicking/popping noise with each step. I have been doing PT. An MRI and was done and found nothing significant except that I have a spare foot bone/os trigonium. \n\n\nObviously this ended up going through workers comp. I am seeing a podiatrist who does not want to address the clicking nose and is of the opinion that I am recovering well. \n\n\nI am frustrated because the popping noise is constant and painful. I feel like something is out of place in my foot and that this will worsen with time. \n\n\nTLDR; foot got crushed. Minor fracture to the medial malleolus. Os trigonium/spare bone present. Four months on foot making loud, constant popping noise when walking, painful. I am a layperson but the pain/noise is around the superior/inferior extensor retinaculum and radiates up the left/outside of my shin (left foot). There is also nerve damage and numbness that comes and goes. \n\n\nWhat could be causing this?  Is there a test or type of imaging to further investigate? They want me to settle but I am concerned this will need surgery down the road.  I am pending a second opinion appt. \n\n\nThanks for reading! I will gladly answer any questions.",

I have been working with doctors for over a year now on trying to understand the nature of my symptoms. In late July of last year, I began experiencing pain and pressure that is focused on the surface of my scalp, my nose, and my temple area. The pain is usually unceasing, reactive to certain movements and postures, and can be worsened by certain things (wearing headphones, for instance, can cause pain to trigger in the area where the headphones are located). Moving my eyes can also be a trigger (in particular, my eyes seem to 'spasm' and then I feel a dull ache behind them for a bit). \n\nI am currently receiving treatment from a headache center for 'migraine', but the constant pain, as well as the attacks, do not align with migraine as I understand it. I have these headaches nearly every day, all day, from the moment I wake until the moment I go to bed. I have tried multiple medications for relief without any so far - topiramate (400mg), zonisamide (100mg), ajovy injections, and now botox injections. \n\nIt feels more like my nerves are on fire, constantly active and extremely sensitive, rather than any headache I have had prior to this starting. The headaches began after receiving a number of dental fillings, and prior to my wisdom teeth coming in last year. After exploring a lot of options, and based on where the pain is located, I am beginning to feel like I have a neuralgic condition - possibly trigeminal neuralgia, focused on the opthalmic nerve. \n\nI wanted to see if I was at least on the right track on where to start the conversation with my doctor, or if there are any other things for me to consider. The pain is unrelenting and has basically caused me to lose any semblance of a social life, and my work performance has suffered drastically. Any help is appreciated. \n\n**Additional demographic data below:** \n\nI have had the following diagnostics: \n\n* Full bloodwork (iron and vitamin b12 was low, have been treated for 3 months) \n* Brain MRI (clean) \n\nI have the following medical conditions: \n\n* Hypothyroidism\n* High blood pressure\n* Obesity (Class III) \n* Bipolar disorder (type 2) \n\nI am taking the following medications daily: \n\n* Levothyroxine 150mcg \n* Estradiol 4mg\n* Lamictal 150mg \n* Zonisamide 100mg\n* Lisinopril/Hydrochlorathiazide 20/12.5\n\nIn addition, I take the following supplements: \n\n* Vitamin D\n* Vitamin B12\n* Iron\n\n&#x200B;",

I\u2019m a very heavy sleeper and, once I\u2019m out, his snoring won\u2019t wake me up. However, it\u2019s quite hard actually falling asleep some nights because the moments he stops breathing and is unable to inhale (his chest rises and he is clearly trying to breathe, but it becomes obstructed) makes me very nervous as I feel responsible for making sure he resumes normal breathing. Usually, I\u2019m able to jostle him slightly and he\u2019s able to resume. I know it will likely resolve without intervention since it, presumably, occurs repeatedly while I\u2019m asleep and, for quite some time this has resolved a lot of my anxiety. \n\nUnfortunately, a close friend of my sister\u2019s died very suddenly of a sleep apnea-induced brain aneurysm at the age of 35 earlier this year. While this newfound fear hasn\u2019t greatly affected my sleep, it does make me very scared. He is in his early thirties and, as is common for men of that age, he is acutely aware of and frightened by aging\u2014 I think the thought of wearing a CPAP reinforces that awareness and fear. \n\nHowever, he has very extensive and stable insurance through the company he\u2019s worked for for the past 15 years and has been made aware that corrective surgery for his septum might be covered by insurance as well as potentially fix this issue. FWIW, his sleep apnea has been destructive to his life in ways more tangible than the idea that he could die in his sleep. It has clearly impacted the quality of his sleep for many years, to the point that, if he is stationary (seated or laying down) without active stimulation, he will be completely and deeply asleep within 30 seconds. It\u2019s actually remarkable to see, as someone who has a reasonably hard time falling asleep. \n\nHe has agreed to pursue medical help for the issue. My question is what the first step looks like and how we should proceed. Should he schedule a consultation with an ENT? Or a GP (we moved under a year ago and I don\u2019t believe he has one here)?\n\n(For the sake of clarity, he is very financially stable and capable of paying for what might not be covered by insurance. If he has no choice but to use a CPAP, he\u2019s going to have to get over it. Rather he feel \u201cold\u201d than be dead before 50). \n\nThank you all in advance. This has been weighing on me. I don\u2019t want to lose my partner so incredibly early in life.",

I am reaching out to the community for some information and guidance regarding the physical symptoms I have been experiencing, which have been progressively impacting my life for the worse. I've tried to keep these symptoms hidden for some time, but recently they have become unbearable, leading to extreme health issues.\n\nI have been dealing with anxiety for nearly a decade. In the early years, I considered it a normal sensation that would pass after a few seconds. However, as time went on, the duration and intensity of my anxiety increased significantly. It became associated with certain physical attributes, such as heights or open spaces, leading me to avoid such situations. Over the years, my brain has linked anxiety to many variables, causing me to restrict various activities to avoid triggering anxiety symptoms.\n\nCurrently, my anxiety has reached a state where I constantly feel pressure on my chest, as if something heavy is building up. This sensation is persistent, lasting 24 hours a day. When I encounter a situation tied to my anxiety triggers, my heart rate increases, and I experience vertigo, numbness in my legs, and bowel issues. Occasionally, I even feel skipped heartbeats.\n\nMy goal is to regain a sense of normalcy, just like I felt 10 years ago. I miss the days when I didn't feel constant chest pressure or my heart racing due to unknown thoughts. I want to travel, enjoy life, and participate in activities like any other person, free from panic episodes. I have tried taking supplements like vitamin D3, folic acid, B12, and iron, but unfortunately, they haven't provided any relief. As a coping mechanism, I find that online games help calm my symptoms, but I spend a significant amount of time engaged in this activity.\n\nI am now seeking advice on how to reach out to a nearby doctor or healthcare professional who can help me with my symptoms. I'm unsure if there is a possible treatment for my condition, but I refuse to believe that I have to continue living like this without any hope for improvement.\n\nIf anyone has had a similar experience or has insights into possible remedies or treatment options, I would greatly appreciate your advice. Additionally, if you could provide guidance on how to effectively communicate my symptoms to a healthcare professional, it would be incredibly helpful.\n\nThank you all for your time and support. I look forward to hearing from you and hopefully finding a path towards relief and recovery.",

The bandage is latex, for some context. I put it on yesterday, and woke up today to take it off and see if the damage has changed. Upon taking it off, however, my wrist was burning like the surface of the sun. It feels just like a sunburn, and was extremely red and enflamed. The red patches are raised, leaving a lot of bumps around my wrist.\r  \n\r  \nI washed my arm off and grabbed an ice pack and rubbed it around my wrist, and that made me feel better immediately. Though, I am still suspicious. I have used these bandages and petroleum jelly before, most notably on my leg when I got a large gash, and I had no adverse effects. I am not allergic to latex, and the bandages were not too tight. And yet, my arm still has raised, red bumps that burn and hurt, right in the bandage's place.\r  \n\r  \nFor more knowledge, the bandages I used were the cohesive non-sterile bandages distributed by McKesson Medical-Surgical Inc., MFR# 16-3404. Thanks for any advice, the pain isn't seething anymore, but still is very much there and gets agitated when I touch the red bumps.\n\nI thought it was an allergic reaction, since that's the obvious answer, but I'm not allergic to latex nor the petroleum jelly. I am taking 20mg of escitalopram, 150mg of lamotrigine, and a birth control with 0.250 mg norgestimate and 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol, though I have used these bandages before while on the same medications. However, I did change my prescription from 225 mg lamotrigine and 10mg escitalopram, the last time I used the bandages. I also do not have any other serious medical conditions, and have a clean slate with substances.\n\nSo, what do y'all think it is? any info would be appreciated.

No existing medical issues. Nonsmoker, nondrinker, no drug usage. I'm not sure if it could be related, but I have began to consistently do weightlifting for the past two months.\n\nI recently noticed a slight bump on my right forearm bone, roughly 4 inches away from the elbow. The bone travels straight from the right side of the wrist (same side as the pinky finger), has a slight bump where the bone goes slightly up and then back down, where it also slightly curves before continuing on a straight path towards the elbow. I'm not 100% sure, but I believe that this is the ulna bone. Initially, I though this could be a normal feature of my bone, perhaps this bone always curved and had a slight bump and I never noticed it before until today. However, I checked my other elbow and the ulna bone there appeared straight throughout the entire forearm from the wrist towards the elbow with no slight bump, which is why I became suspicious and made this post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImages: [Side view.](https://i.postimg.cc/Zq169DBG/img-1.png)  [Front view.](https://postimg.cc/8Jk7SvKS) [Picture showing entire back of forearm.](https://i.postimg.cc/SR84SjF0/img-4.png) \n\nNote: I circled the rough location of the bump in the first two images so its more clearly visible and not to be confused with the other pimples in the area of the arm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe slight bump is immovable which is why I suspect the bump is some curvature of the forearm bone and not some skin rash. The region of curvature/bump is relatively small, roughly 0.5 inches, though for some reason the bump is slightly visible and appears larger than it actually is when viewing the arm. Other than the bump, I don't feel any abnormal growth of any bone in that area. The bump is painless, I just happened to find it randomly as I was inspecting my arm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs a slight bump of the forearm ulna bone as it travels towards the elbow a normal anatomy of the human body or is this potentially serious? I'm suspecting this is just some normal feature of my bone that I never noticed in my life until today, but I wanted to err on the side of caution. Perhaps it could have been some former bruise or other injury to the bone to the area that I just never noticed and healed, but I would think that a injury to the bone would hurt enough that I would remember the incident. Should I see my primary care physician just to be safe here? I was a little nervous of going to the doctor in case this is not a serious thing or if this is an overreaction and I end up just wasting their time.",

I\u2019ve had a confirmed herniated disc in my lower back (I think L5) for over a year now with symptoms going back over 2 years. Last year I went in for an MRI to figure out what was going on when I collapsed from a sharp pain down my left leg. Found out what was going on and did some intense sessions of spinal decompression. I say intense because I unfortunately don\u2019t have a very \u201cnormal\u201d life. I travel for a living running a construction business and am gone 300+ days a year. I had ten days off when I was going through all this and the doctor wanted to expedite the procedures. So I went full in doing 1 hour sessions on the table at 135-155 lbs of force. It sucked ass and durning one particular session I couldn\u2019t control the pain and was struggling breathing and dripping sweat but the doctor kept me on the table.. I personally think something bad happened because for about 10 days after that it hurt to pretty much do anything. \n\nFast forward a year I\u2019m still in a lot of pain. About 4 months ago I had another \u201ctwinge\u201d that has made me have constant and rather sever sciatica down my left leg. I constantly have nerve pain shooting down my leg and after a days work, getting clean and resting for a moment I can barely get up and walk I\u2019m in so much pain. It ebs and flows week to week some weeks I feel pretty good and like I\u2019m on the mend then get kick back down. \n\nSo here\u2019s my dilemma. I have a business that requires me to be on the road constantly, I can\u2019t take the amount of time off I need to consistently do spinal decompression nor do I know if I want to do that again. I\u2019ve been advised by doctors that surgery isn\u2019t a good idea with my line if work in that I can just re-injure myself maybe more severely. I also won\u2019t be able to have that much downtime for the healing process. I\u2019ve tried the stretching and exercises but that has always seemed to make it worse. I know there are Corazon shots out there but I\u2019m afraid to just numb the pain. I have learned how to work with and around the pain. I\u2019m afraid if I just numb the pain I\u2019ll just further injure my back without knowing then be in a real bad way. I feel I\u2019m stuck until I\u2019m able to get out of this line of work which I can\u2019t just quit because it is a business that fully relies on me and involves a lot of others livelihoods. I\u2019m just tired of being in pain. I\u2019m 29 and feel like I\u2019m 70 when I\u2019m walking around.

I sustained what I believe to be a chostochondral separation (I.E. separated rib) approximately 54 days prior to this post. \n\nWhile I was training Brazilian jujitsu, I was trying to escape from a ground position against an opponent with great top pressure. I was lying in a position similar to a right lateral recumbent position. I attempted to roll over my right shoulder to my back, which is a normal movement for me in that scenario, and subsequently felt 2-3 pops in my rib cage on the right side with a sharp pain while attempting the maneuver. The pain was located laterally to the sternum about 2 inches below the nipple line, and radiated laterally toward the coronal plane. I\u2019m a very flexible person and my body cracks and pops all the time (plus the adrenaline took the edge off the pain), so I tried to persevere through and felt 2 more pops at the same location. I stopped the training session and tried to walk it off for a few minutes and began to feel better. I then tried to train again and immediately felt 2-3 more pops at the same location just from extending my arms and moving. The pain was now more intense at this moment. I stopped training and laid on my back for 10-20 minutes with no improvement to the pain. \n\nI then drove myself to a local ER where I got the normal blood work up, EKG, and an X-ray. My pain increased in severity so they have me Toradol to take the edge off. The ER physician told me my X-rays looked fine and discharged me. \n\nThe next day, I coincidentally had my annual physical exam with my primary care physician. He\u2019s a D.O., so when I told him about my injury, he palpated my rib cage and said he could note what felt like a rib \u2018dislocation\u2019. I\u2019m an EMT, so I of course tried palpating the difference my physician noted on my right side in comparison to my left side and could not tell a difference. My PCP told me to expect a 1-2 week recovery and that I might notice my rib pop back into place during that time. He told me returning to jujitsu will be based on my pain tolerance. \n\nWell, I\u2019m now 54 days since the injury and my pain has mostly improved. I do still have pain with pressure/forceful contact. I never experienced any sort of popping sensation to indicate my rib has relocated itself. \n\nMy question is this:\n\nFirstly, did I actually sustain a separated rib? Or is this some other injury? \n\nSecondly, if it is a separated rib, what is my risk for re-injury? \nI\u2019d like to return to training jujitsu, and if it\u2019s only a matter of pain tolerance, at this point I can persevere through the discomfort. My concern is that I would return too soon and re-injure or worsen an injury that I\u2019ve waited 2 months to recover from already. \n\nAny thoughts or insight anyone has would be greatly appreciated as there is not a lot of good information on a separated rib injury on the internet. Thanks in advance!",

Not taking any substances, no smoking, etc etc.\n\nI\u2019ve been having a cough for the last 2 weeks. Prior to developing the cough I had a sore throat for 2 days, then a VERY itchy/dry throat for another day, and the cough started from the feeling of needing to constantly clear my throat. I had pretty bad postnasal drip initially which I think was what gave me a sore throat, but it\u2019s pretty much gone now.\n\nI haven\u2019t had any other symptoms which I thought was strange, and I\u2019ve never had allergies before that gave me anything more than a stuffy nose. Occasionally I will cough and taste saltiness from mucus, but no big globs or anything. Mucus is clear.\n\nIt usually stops once I\u2019m laying down and quiet. It doesn\u2019t bother me when I\u2019m trying to sleep, and when I first wake up in the morning. It only starts when I start talking, laughing, or walking about in the house and doing light activity.\n\nWhat I REALLY find strange though is that I went outside and walked around for a couple hours, NO coughing. It was even hot out so I was panting. Still no cough, unless I was thinking about coughing (and then of course I make myself cough a little).\n\nAny ideas? I know I\u2019m supposed to get a cough checked after 3 weeks, but I\u2019ve never experienced a cough like this before so was wondering if I could get opinions.

        "context": "Strange Rash like abnormality following Veins\n25 Year old Male \nNot using any medication, though I do smoke marijuana recreationally. Drink occasionally but not a lot or often. Only known allergy is Grass. No exposure to oils, chemicals, fuels etc. Commercial fisherman, that relevance of that is explained towards end of post.\n\nTo start, this is the 3rd time this has occurred for me, and I have been to a hospital previously for this issue. While it looks VERY similar to blood poisoning, it is 100% confirmed not to be. \n\nTHE ISSUE: I have had a strange, rashlike abnormality as stated in title, that has now popped up for a 3rd time in 6 years. Everytime it occurs on both forearms bilaterally, and what makes this \"rash\" particularly interesting is it follows my veins perfectly, starting about 5 inches above the wrist and ending just before the elbow. It starts on the first day as a kind of blotchy red rash following the veins on the inside of the forearm, and the 3rd time this occured I noticed a kind of burning/itching sensation on the forearm. On day 2 it stays the same red, less blotchy but is about the perfect width of my vein. Day 3ish it starts to turn  dark, and by day 4-5 there's no sign of any redness or irritation, just a dark, almost scar tissue textured line following veins perfectly. Previously it has lasted roughly 7-10 days before subsiding. I call this an abnormality as I never had any confirmation on what it was.\n\nSTEPS ALREADY TAKEN: I have visited the hospital for this issue, and was immediately more or less the hospitals priority patient for a few days. The Triage Nurses, Doctors, Head of the ER, and other ER nursing staff had never seen something like this occur bilaterally on both arms and had no explanation for it. The first guess was possibly DVT, but ultrasound scans ruled that out (it should be noted, the doctor pointed out that the veins in the afflicted area seemed softer then those that were unaffected). Also had a dermatologist inspect it and perform a biopsy. He left me a voice mail saying he knew what the \"rash\" was, though didn't know why it only followed the veins. He didn't relay what the rash was and I'm trying to see if I can obtain a report on that as its now relevant again. It was at this point last time that the dark lines disappeared so further tests weren't able to be conducted. As far as any of the doctors were aware, this hasn't been reported on before as they had no luck finding anything that explained it. \n\nI am a fisherman, and the only reason I mention this is because the only time this happens has been on a boat and generally in higher temperatures. I'll also note that my arms are quite vascular and protrude from the skin a fair amount. Everytime this rash happens, the veins no longer create that \"bump\" if that makes sense, hence the doctor mentioning the veins seemed like they went soft (I don't do drugs/use needles to clarify). There's no other correlating factors that I've been able to take note of. I have taken photos since it first appeared this time to track its progress from the \"rash\" to it turning to a darker colour. \n\nI'm curious if any medical personnel have seen anything similar that might be able to give some idea as to what it is and maybe that can potentially help medical personnel on this end",

I was drugged for most of it, probably some kind of pain killer or sedative. I was also often left with physical trauma and regularly had tearing and bleeding. \n\nWhen I was about 10 I got my period, but I thought it was just from my abuse, so I didn't realize. Thus, no one knew. When I was 11, I had (what I now know as an adult) a miscarriage by myself. I had no idea I was pregnant so I didn't tell anyone. Some people had started to comment on my stomach growing, making jokes about me getting fat and looking pregnant. But I had no sex education or knowledge at all of biology, so I was just confused. Anyway, I'll spare the details unless they are needed, but I passed a fetus and a LOT of blood and tissue. The fetus was kind of deformed and the color was kind of purple, the head still had a kind of lima bean shaped with black dots (?) for eyes. It had legs arms and the beginning of nubs for toes and fingers. It was about the size of my palm, maybe a little smaller. I am wondering if by that description anyone would be able to give an estimate for how far along I was? I bled pretty heavily for three days and just faked a stomach bug. \n\nMy next question has to do with my health now. I have VERY painful menstruation. It feels like blood just collects in my organs and feels like they are going to burst. The lighter my period is, the more it hurts. The only thing that's ever helped some us being on the birth control pill. I've had pelvic ultrasounds, and I do have ovarian cysts but no evidence of abnormal endometrial tissue. My hormone levels also suggested PCOS, so that is what they diagnosed me with. My obgyn also has commented that I have one of the smallest cervix openings she has ever seen. She was like visibly shocked the first time she examined me. \n\nAlso, the first time I had PIV sex as an adult (24 years old), my hymen was already broken and damaged from childhood, so there was no tearing there, but my vagina inside was like ..blocked? It took a while and a lot of force to actual get my inner vaginal cannal to open. It was not vaginismus, as I've experienced that. My muscles where very relaxed and it wasn't a lubrication problem. It was like an internal blockage. Once I finally got past it, there was almost like a popping sensation and a LOT of blood. But after that, no problems with PIV sex. \n\nOne other thing I should mention is I have memories of being hospitalized for a few days with some kind of vaginal injury as a kid, maybe 6 years old, I definitely had some kind of surgical procedure under anesthesia. I remember my parents telling the doctors it was due to a bike accident. Unfortunately, all of my medical records were wiped at the hospital so they can give me no information (long story).\n\nThanks for reading all of that. Does anyone have any feedback for me?

        "context": "38 Male - Swelling of right index finger around proximal phalange. Xray taken, Ultrasound done, no satisfying conclusion. Looking for an otrthopedic opinion. Details inside.\nSummary of medications and procedures:\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \nAumentin - 7 day course + 3 additional days\n\nDoxycycline - 7 day course\n\nClindomycin - 7 day course\n\nRocephin - IV antibiotics\n\nX-Ray\n\nUltrasound  \n\\----------------------------------------------------------------  \n\n\nOn June 27th, 2023 I wash bitten by my pet cat on my right index finger where the finger meets the palm. In total, there were 4 significant puncture wounds, two on the palmer side, and two on the back. Patient (I) immediately washed the affected area with soap and water and dressed the wounds with banadages. Within an hour, the finger became inflamed. Not knowing about the severity of cat bites, I went to bed that night expecting the swelling to subside. When it was still swollen in the morning, I decided to go to Urgent Cate (not the ER) after I got off work that evening. That evening, at Urgent Care, the NP examined the finger and reached the same conclusion I had made myself - bacterial infection due to cat bite resulting in cellulitis of the finger, and I was prescribed a 7 day course of Augmentin. I reprimanded myself for not acting sooner, and considered it a hard lesson learned about cat bites. I went home and began my antibiotic regimen, thinking my finger problem would be gone within the week.\n\nSeven days later, to the credit of the antibiotics, the swelling had decreased a bit, but the finger was clearly still swollen and there was still some throbbing pain, so I returned to Urgent Care. I expressed my concerns at this point that there might be something more significant going on with my finger. The NP (a different one this time) examined my finger again, told me that sometimes antibiotics take longer, and prescribed me 3 more days of Augmentin. I left this time unsatisfied.\n\nTwo days later (July 6th, 2023) I made up my mind to go to the emergency room. On the way, my partner suggested (and managed to convince me) to instead go to a nearby Prompt Care instead. Even though I was certain I would receive the same response, I obliged (the reasoning was to save money, even though my insurance would have covered the ER visit). Prompt Care NP looked at my finger, once again. At this point, I had done more research on my own, and my own armchair diagnostic was that I had managed to get a case of flexor tenosynovitis, though I wasn't 100% certain, because I did not meet all four of the Kanavel criteria for a accurate diagnosis. For one, the entirety of my finger wasn't swollen, just around the proximal phalange, and I mistaken assumed that I was able to fully extend the finger without any real pain (I was incorrect on this point.)   \n\n\nI shared my self-diagnosis with the NP, who took me to get X-Rays done of my finger. The findings of X-Rays are as follows:  \n\\-----------------------------------\n\nFindings: The bony structures are intact and normally aligned. The joint spaces are preserved. Soft tissue swelling is seen in the proximal aspect of the index finger.  \n\n\nConclusion: No acute osseous abnormality. Soft tissue swelling in the proximal index finger. No definite foreign bodies are present.  \n\\----------------------------------  \n\n\nIn addition to the X-Ray, this NP prescribed me a 7 day course of Doxycycline, and set me up with a referral to a recommended \"hand specialist\". I left with a little relief, as at least now I would be able to get a hand specialist to confim my suspicions of flexor tenosynovitis or at the very least give me a conclusive reason as to why my finger was still swollen. I called to set up an appointment with the hand specialist and it went to voice mail. I left my name and number and for 2 whole days I did not receive a call back. I was now frustrated at this point, as I had not yet had a definitive answer as to why my finger was swollen, the antibiotics were no longer showing any signs of affect, and I couldn't get ahold of the hand specialist.  On July 14th, 2023, I had reached my breaking point, and drove myself to the nearest ER.  \n\n\nAfter a 7 hour wait (understandable), I was finally face to face with an actual doctor. Took one look at my finger, and after I explained the series of events and my own self diagnosis, he began testing for the 4 Kanavel signs. Turns out, when I was testing for the pain on extension sign, I clearly wasn't pushing hard enough, because when he did it, it was painful. He also scheduled an X-ray, and their X-ray confirmed what the Prompt Care X-ray showed, as mentioned above. At this point, he called for an orthopedic surgeon to come look at my finger. While flexor tenosynovitis was the suspected culprit, the orthopedic surgeon noted that if it was that, that it was strange for the swelling to be localized to just around the proximal phalange, and not the whole finger (sausage finger). He scheduled an ultrasound to be done on my finger later in the week. I was also at this point prescribed a 7 day course of Clindomycin, and was also given IV antibiotics (cefTRIAXone ((Rocephin)). Here is the relevant clinical summary of the attending physician:\n\n\\------------------------------  \nMusculoskeletal: There is focal swelling of the right index finger between MCP and PIP. there is point tenderness. He can range the finger in both flexion and extension. Hyperextension does recreate pain in the finger between the MCP and the PIP. There is no palmar induration or tenderness to examine.\n\nGiven the persistence of swelling on the patient I did consult with orthopedic surgery despite not being an overt tenosynovitis. The consulting doctor was kind enough for ED consultation this morning and feels with the focality of the patient's pain the best management strategy is broadening antibiotics with close follow up which he will provide in his clinic.\n\nPatient previously on Augmentin though it was 500/125 TID for 7 days. Patient is now on doxycycline 100 mg PO BID. Usually this would be combined with clindamycin and that was started in ED as well as a large dose of 3rd generation cephalosporin. The consulting doctor will see the patient in his clinic in 1 week.\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\nOn Wednesday of this week, I went to see the consulting orthopedic doctor, who examined the finger and looked at my finger on the ultrasound. At this point I had more knowledge of flexor tenosynovitis in my head than I ever wanted, and expected to see the cause of my swelling and continued pain show up on the ultrasound in the form of an abscess or pus. I had mentally prepared myself for the ortho doc to confirm my suspicions and tell me that I would have to have surgery to drain the pus out of my finger.\n\nThis did not happen. Ultrasound did not discover any signs of an abscess or any signs of pus. Ortho doc says he has no reason to operate on my finger, because there is nothing to drain. Doc sent me home and told me to continue taking the antibiotics I was prescribed. When I asked then, \"why is my finger still swollen?\" I was not given a conclusive answer - only that injuries on the extremities, especially the hands, can sometimes take a while to heal. I was recommended alternating hot and cold soaks of my finger to see if that would help with the swelling, which is something I've been doing since this whole ordeal started, anyway.\n\nCurrently, the finger is still swollen around the proximal phalange, and from my untrained eye, it seems to be about as inflamed as it was 2 weeks ago. I cannot clench my fist. The index finger is still held in partial flexion. For a mental image, if I attempt to make a hook shape with my index finger, I am unable to do so. I feel pain at the base of the proximal phalange and even a bit around the metacarpal bone of the index finger when i apply significant pressure.\n\nIn summary, I am no closer today of knowing exactly why my finger is still swollen, and the general consensus of all the nurse practitioners and doctors I have talk to is to wait and see. Which, to be clear, is fine *if that is indeed the best course of action.* And that's all the information I have. Hopefully it was informative. I tried to include as much detail as possible. I will close this post with a collection of images of the finger. These were taken last week, but as far as I can tell, the finger looks the same today as it did then. \n\nUltimately, what I'm looking for in a reply here is if the \"Wait and see\" option is the correct course here. I'm wondering if somebody missed something. It has been swollen for nearly a month now, and I have bombarded this finger with a multitudinous payload of antibiotics, and they don't seem to be doing anything.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my post.\n\n[Image 1 - Front of finger](https://imgur.com/a/ixRNg4C)\n\n[Image 2 - Back of Finger](https://imgur.com/a/KNx0row)\n\n[Image 3 -  Side of finger / how far it can currently bend](https://imgur.com/a/f76Z0Hu)\n\n[Image 4 - Side of finger (attempt at holding all fingers in hyper extension)](https://imgur.com/a/SdOuDJu)\n\n[Image 5 - Left Hand side view for comparison of left index finger and right index finger.](https://imgur.com/a/QX4AHOr)  \n",

Both medicines were a miracle to me and a poison at the same time. Literally, Lexapro fixed all my mental problems that I suffered all my life since I was a child. \nBoth SSRI made me sleepy and less motivated, especially in the morning. In the night I felt so awake that I couldn\u2019t sleep, I have been 24-26 hours awake and can\u2019t sleep no matter what I did. Also both SSRI made me very unstable.\nIn summary the meds were a miracle, but couldn\u2019t sleep and feel so unstable.\nMy doc put me on lithium plus SSRI, after reading a few reviews about lithium figured out that it\u2019s for treating bipolar disorders, and that SSRI tend to increase bipolar symptoms. Well, lithium really stabilized me and felt so good, but the insomnia were worse, I couldn\u2019t understand because it\u2019s supposed that lithium should improve my sleep, but made me some like hypomanic all day, no mood swings, all day stable, but hypomanic.\nMy doc then put me on Lamictal plus SSRI and it\u2019s the same, the day after I took my first 25 mg of Lamictal, couldn\u2019t sleep. When I was only on SSRI, If I took Ambien or Klonopin, I slept well, but that meds made me really depressed until 18-19 hours for the next day. Now with mood stabilizers and SSRI I have to take like 2-3 Ambien and only can sleep for 4-5 hours. Klonopin 1 mg always knocked me out, but now I felt NOTHING from Klonopin and can\u2019t sleep (it\u2019s not something like tolerance, because when I withdraw my mood stabilizers, Ambien and Klonopin made me sleep well instantly)\nNow I\u2019m on Wellbutrin 300 and Lamictal 200 (I have been on both 4 months), and I can sleep again with no problems, but I feel exactly like I was before taking ssri, I feel like I have a little more energy, but the depression and anxiety it\u2019s the same that before, it\u2019s like I am on nothing, just a little more enrgized. \n\nI want to know if anyone has been through this, like, adding a mood stabilizer to an SSRI and the insomnia worsened. I feel like I lost all the hope on being well mentally. I have been on meds from like 3 years and yet I cannot say that I have been good and stable for more than two days straight in years. SSRI seems the only med that works for me, but at the same time they are poison to me \ud83d\ude1e.\n\nI was reading that Prozac it\u2019s the most friendly SSRI for bipolar people, I\u2019d like to know if anyone has been for something like that, so I can say to my doc if we can try that ( also feel like a liability to my doc, three years going there and almost no progress)\n\nI am Male 24 years old if that matter. Also tried ADHD meds: Vyvanse and Strattera gave me\nInsomnia, but it\u2019s not like the SSRI, this insomnia was more like I was anxious and that made me sleep poorly, a little dosage of some anxiolytic med and sleep well through the night. The SSRI insomnia it\u2019s not like that, because I don\u2019t feel anxious, it\u2019s like my body don\u2019t want to sleep no matter what.\n\nSorry for my English, I am Spanish native speaker.",

We believe the foot drop came on immediately after the accident, but due to the extent of other injuries, we didn\u2019t formally look into foot drop for a couple of weeks. I was unable to lift my foot immediately after the accident, as I did attempt to walk to the ambulance on the night of. \n\n The combination of lower back/buttocks pain and the inability to lift the front of my foot resulted in a diagnosis of foot drop. My foot does not respond to any reflex tests, and even the electric pulses during the nerve conduction study, did not cause my foot to lift. \n\nUnfortunately, this is about where the information stops. Since this point, I\u2019ve done thoracic and lumbar spinal MRIs, which revealed bulging discs in my lumbar spine at the L5/S1 levels, but these aren\u2019t impacting the nerve and don\u2019t explain the drop foot. I\u2019ve had a lower leg nerve conduction study, which showed no breaks in the nerves from my knee down. \nSince then, despite being diagnosed with foot drop by a spinal surgeon, 2 physios, my regular doctor and the neurologist who did the nerve conduction study, nobody has been able to tell me where to go next.

When I say urge to pee I mean pee is on the highway and wants to come out.  The pee is not the normal strong steam that I usually get.  I feel like I'm getting this urge to pee when my bladder is not really full and thus why there is not a lot.\n\nI've also noticed issues where I'll pee and then 5 minutes later I have the urge to pee again and the same amount of pee comes out as before.  Sometimes the stream gets in to this pattern of start then slow down and then back to speed. I can feel the muscle, or whatever it is, involuntary contract a bit before relaxing again and letting the pee flow.\n\nIt seems to have gotten better since Wednesday as the urge was basically all the time and now it's just after I have drank too much liquids and after dinner.  The urge is also not on the highway kind but more of a normal I have to pee.  I'll pee a bunch times as described above over the course of a couple hours and then it feels like I'm back to normal.  Wednesday and Thursday night I was having issues sleeping with the constant urge to pee.\n\nI've noticed in the last 24 hours that standing seems to make things go back to closer to normal and sitting posture seems to matter as well.  If I sit up straight it seems to make the urges go away over  bad posture like slouching in my seat.  I don't seem to have the issue lying done at this point either.\n\nI don't think it's a UTI as there is no burning, discharge, or anything along those lines.  It's just frequent urination where not a normal amount comes out.  I've been drinking cranberry juice anyways as a precaution.  I think the sex act with my spouse may have done something strange to my bladder and the nerves to potentially cause this.\n\nSo the sex act is probably not what you think.  I'm a male (42) and my spouse is a female.  She likes to be a dominate at times and Tuesday night was one of those nights.\n\nSo basically we had a milking table situation where she was edging me and not letting me release until she says so.  This went one for over an hour.  At one point while I was erect I said I have to pee.  She being the dominate person said I was not allowed to stop and pee.\n\nHonestly I thought it felt pretty good with her stroking me on the edge while I had that peeing sensation going on.  So I didn't use the safe word and let her continue.  So after 15 more minutes of this I finally exploded all over the place and went to pee.\n\nThis was one of those pees with an erection so it didn't go well with all the bending to make sure pee get in the toilet and not all over the place.  Anyway I pee and go back to my wife, but 5 minutes later I get the urge to pee again where it felt like pee was on the highway.  This happened a bunch more times throughout the night.\n\nAnyways after this event with my wife the peeing has been a little messed up.  I think some nerves and signals in my body may have got crossed up with the above event.  I have not done anything sexual since, either solo or with my wife.\n\nMy wife actually feels terrible and thinks she broke something in my penis / bladder.  I tell her it's not her fault and say it'll be all ok, but she still feels bad.  I try to comfort her the best I can.\n\nAnyways, I'm not looking for direct medical advice as I said I'm calling my doctor on Monday for an appointment that will probably not be on Monday.  The practice is pretty busy with same day appointments not being available outside of an emergency, which this is not in my mind.\n\nThough I was thinking if I should go to Urgent Care or something to get something checked out.  I don't think my prostate all of a sudden grew and became a problem overnight, but if I need the finger up the butt to check things out sooner than later then fair game for urgent care.\n\nThough if anybody has some related situations they were in that can calm my mind then that would be great.  Even if it was you had something similar happen and just took it easy for a week and things got back to normal. I'm still going to see my doctor, but it would help ease the mind.\n\nI've been exercising and doing Yoga for the last year to get in better health as I've lost 40lbs and 8 inches off my waist.  So if there are some poses that help with bladder functionality then I'm game to incorporate them in to my routine.\n\nThanks for reading and sorry it is so long.  I've been thinking about this for a bit, lol.",

I drink like once a month with friends. I [23F, 5\u20198\u201d, 145lbs] have had CHRONIC constipation from the time I was 2 years old. My bowel movements have always been infrequent, (once every 4-5 days), and they are incredibly large and painful to pass. No doctor has taken this seriously, and they tell me I need to change my diet to include more fruits and vegetables. \n\nI have tried everything under the sun in terms of diet to try to help, but nothing helps. Two foods make it worse: Bagels and bananas. If I eat either of those, I can expect not to poop for a week. I have been on miralax my entire life. It\u2019s frustrating to be on it, because my body will swing to overly soft poops, I\u2019ll stop taking it for a day or two, and then all of the sudden I have like a rock in my stomach of poop. Miralax also takes 3-4 days to kick in each time. \n\nThe only thing I consume that causes me to have a bowel movement within 10 hours is alcohol. If I drink, the next morning it feels like I finally passed everything that had been sitting in my body for the last week. This is not to say I use it for this. I am not a frequent drinker. I am just wondering why NOTHING I eat or consume helps, but for some reason alcohol clears me out IMMEDIATELY. \n\nI have suspected ehlers-danlos, and sometimes it just feels like the main problem is that my intestines just don\u2019t move things along. I do have a family history of colon cancer, and I intend on making a gastro appointment soon, but I am not worried about cancer currently because I have been constipated my whole life. Regardless, the gastro appointment is 20 years overdue, because I can\u2019t live like this anymore. I have so much constipation that it causes acid reflux and extreme bloating. I also have INTENSE stomach pain that burns in the lower part of my stomach that I attribute to the constipation and gas. It hurts so bad that my face will turn pale, I burn up, and I get sweaty. \n\nSo my question is: Why does alcohol work? Are there any suggestions on other medicines I could take that would move things along? And any ideas about why someone would have chronic constipation their whole life? Obviously I will be going to a doctor, but just wondering if anyone had any thoughts about if there\u2019s something wrong with me or if some people are just born with chronic constipation. \n\n\nMedications:\n\nViibryd 40mg\nWellbutrin 300mg\nAlprazolam .5mg\n\nDiagnoses:\nAnxiety \nDepression\nOCD\nADHD\nInflammatory arthritis\nSuspected EDS (according to drs)",

Its almost impossible doing simple tasks and my relatives have been taking care of me and making my meals. I have apathy and physical numbness, can't feel my body temperature properly, tremors. I can walk, though it feels weird, and my strength is fairly normal. It feels like suddenly I lost some layers of tissue in my body. I have control over my muscles but it doesn't feel the same, like fine motor control is slightly different. My breathing rhythm is abnormal and muscles in my diaphragm or stomach area are weak.

My training partner went to \u201csweep\u201d my foot (kicking my foot up off the mat with his foot to take me down to the mat). I lifted my foot to avoid his, planted it back on the mat, and immediately slipped in sweat and my leg twisted behind me and I landed on it hearing/feeling a \u201ccrunch\u201d but no pop. I laid in the mat and an ER nurse with trains there came over felt around my leg and put me in a makeshift splint with a cardboard box and athletic tape. I went to the ER. They did multiple X-rays. The doctor there said I fractured my proximal fibula via a spiral fracture but that it was minor and I had a bad ankle sprain. Their X-ray report of my ankle says there is no fracture or dislocation in it. They gave me crutches and a short term ankle and leg brace to be replaced when I went for follow up with ortho.\n\nThe next day I went to see an orthopedic surgeon. They did a quick physical exam, then did a stress x-ray by moving my ankle under the X-ray while I laid down. There was no additional pain felt in my ankle when this was done. They said I had ligament instability in my ankle and would need to have a plate and screws surgically inserted. They wanted surgery for two days later. No MRI or other test were done, I was put in a splint and I was sent on my way.\n\nMy primary care physician asked if an MRI was ordered. I said no. They believed one should be done prior to going right to surgery. I sent a message to ortho letting them know what my primary said and asked if they thought it would help based on their experience. It was read but never replied to. Primary care doctor ordered an mri and sent a referral to another orthopedic surgeon who specializes in foot and ankle injuries and is one of the best in my area, working as the foot and ankle consultant for our local professional sports teams and division one university sports teams. I have an appt with him early this upcoming week.\n\nWhen I called the first ortho to reschedule the surgery, prior to the surgery not the day of, due to my primary care physician\u2019s referral and the person driving me to the hospital not being able to the day of the surgery, the person I spoke with seemed to get upset and said I should be grateful they were able to schedule the surgery and that if it\u2019s not done within 10 days of the injury surgery will be harder and they likely won\u2019t help me. I was then told I have a Maisonneuve fracture in my ankle. I said that wasn\u2019t said to me when I was there (and I found it odd I was only directly told after calling to reschedule the surgery). They said I must have been overwhelmed and so they canceled the surgery and scheduled a follow up but said I\u2019d have to have the surgery the day after the follow up.\n\nAm I wrong for wanting a second opinion? And if I don\u2019t do surgery within ten days (it happened this past Tuesday night) will it really make surgery worse? I\u2019m not wanting to be difficult, and if I need surgery they I need it and will do it, but I want to make sure first. And I have a really good, and long standing, relationship with my primary. I trust them. So I went for the MRI she ordered and I\u2019m inclined to get the second opinion. Does anyone have any suggestions or information which might make things clearer for me?

Everything always came back clean and normal. \n\nLate 2020, I had a migraine attack that was different than my usual ones. During the attack, both of my arms became super painful. It felt like I had gotten multiple tetanus shots or covid vaccines in both arms. They were super painful. Even if I didn\u2019t move them, they were throbbing in pain. After the attack passed, my arms felt dead as if I overdid it at the gym lifting weights. It felt better the next day. This symptom did not happen again until the following year. \n\nOctober of 2021 I got hit with another strong migraine attack and the painful arm symptom came back for this one. It was beyond painful, I was crying from the pain. I was supposed to be enjoying my best friends pre-wedding celebration but was in the bedroom crying in pain. I didn\u2019t have medication with me so I suffered through it for a while. Finally after laying in the dark long enough and taking enough over the counter medication and some caffeine the severe pain became more bearable. I ran home and grabbed my imitrex and took it. I had the dead arm feeling for the rest of the night. Woke up in the morning and everything was back to normal. \n\nAll through 2022 is when my migraines started happening 6-7 times a month instead of the normal 2-3 times every 6 months. My doctor tried putting me on topomax as a preventative but it didn\u2019t work and since severe kidney stones runs in my entire family, the doctor decided to take me off of it and just use imitrex proactively. At the very first sign of a headache, he wanted me to take the imitrex to knock it out before it started. That has worked well so far but it\u2019s imitrex\u2026and obviously I don\u2019t want to overdo it. \n\nIn December 2022 the stress from work caused me to break out into Shingles. It broke out on my face on the left side and inside my ear canal. While shingles in general is painful\u2026shingles INSIDE YOUR EAR \u2026is PURE torture. My ear became so swollen it closed, it was actively bleeding, I was in excruciating pain. I spent Christmas in the hospital due to it. The doctor at the hospital was 99.9% sure I had shingles but wanted to do a CT Scan with contrast to make sure there wasn\u2019t any infection behind the ear that we couldn\u2019t see. So I got the ct scan, and the doctor came back and told me they \u201caccidentally found a brain tumor that they suspect is a meningioma during the scan.\u201d I was kind just over the fact that I was in so much pain and hearing that I had a brain tumor of some sort was just the cherry on top. \n\nI saw my neurologist and explained that my migraines went from 1-2 times every 6 months to 6-7 times per month and I had this growth found in/on my brain. He looked at the ct scan and said \u201cwe\u2019ll just keep an eye on it and get your migraines under control for now\u201d \n\n2 nights ago I had an absolutely horrible migraine. My arms were killing me, my legs were hurting this time as well, all the muscles in my body became tense and sore, I couldn\u2019t sleep, I became nauseated and had to go to the bathroom. I went to the bathroom and my dog follows me everywhere. She was sitting at the door of the bathroom and so I tried to call her to me and I couldn\u2019t speak correctly. My speech became mumbled. I knew what I was trying to say, I was completely alert and conscious but I could NOT get words out. They just sounded like mumbles and sounds. This lasted for about 5 minutes. My throat became sore as well and it felt like my tongue was swollen. \n\nEventually my migraine passed, my entire body was exhausted and painful as if I went too hard at the gym. \n\nI am currently waiting to be scheduled at Mayo Clinic where my original neurologist is. It\u2019s just tough to get in with her because she is now the director.\n\nMy question is\u2026.is it possible that the meningioma/brain tumor (not 100% diagnosed as meningioma since no further testing has been done since the hospital visit) could be causing these new symptoms with my migraines and causing the frequency of my migraines to go up? \n\nI am obviously going to be seeing my neurologist but until then, I just want to kind of get an idea of whether the growth/tumor could be a potential culprit for the worsening symptoms and more frequent migraines? \n\n**TL;DR:** Suffer from migraines since childhood. In 2020 I had 1 migraine with a new symptom where my arms became very painful. That specific symptom didn\u2019t happen again until October 2021. Had the same painful arms during the migraine attack. The entire next year my migraines went from 1-2 times every 6 months to 6-7 times a month. The arm pain happens with every attack now. December 2022 I got shingles on my face in inside my ear canal. ER physician had me do a ct scan to rule out infection and they found a brain tumor and said it looks like a meningioma. Neurologist said we will \u201ckeep an eye on it\u201d in January but I haven\u2019t had any further scans done. 2 days ago I had another severe migraine attack only this time my entire body became extremely painful, my throat became sore, and I lost the ability to speak for about 5 minutes. I was alert and coherent but could not get words out. Can the meningioma/brain growth be a potential culprit for the worsening symptoms and more frequent attacks? I am currently waiting to be scheduled for an appointment with my old neurologist at the Mayo Clinic.",

From several past bad experiences I didn't have confidence in her ability as a doctor, but baby is coming, so not really up to me. She complained to the nurse that she had to come in after dinner for me so I already had the impression her headspace was not where it needed to be. \n\nShe didn't look at my chart, or not closely to see that I had an anterior placenta. I hemorrhaged and they couldn't get her out for what felt like forever. I see a ton of people rushing in and when she's out she's not breathing and everyone is working on her. The doctor is doing all the rest of the stuff and when the sheet is moved her and the nurse's face are absolutely covered in blood. She was frazzled and very nervous. My baby comes around and by the 5 minute APGAR is at 9 instead of 1 and didn't even need to be in the NICU. I am so thankful and it was the scariest time of my life.\n\nBut my question is: could she have botched my bilateral salpingectomy? Could she have maybe forgotten to even do it? I know that doctors are used to high stress and what is scary to me may not be to them, but this person was obviously not ok. She was shaking and pale and very nervous when the curtain came down and I was stitched up. Or did she not see that I was to have a bi salp after delivery? If she looked at my chart, it wasn't very closely. I did mention it in the beginning to her, but with the scary event and the fact that she didn't seem very interested in what I had to say, I'm wondering if it was even done or done accurately. How could this happen? Can anyone offer insight into this? \n\nI did look up her reports to verify if it was done. They are not detailed at all. Doesn't mention a salpingectomy at all, glosses over the blood loss and even though it was more than 1800 she said it was \"no more than expected\" in her report. Didn't say anything about my baby not breathing or any mention of the placenta whatsoever. For being in there for 90 minutes, it was very, very short. \n\nLabs mention the fallopian tubes, but no detail besides the exact same descriptors for each, like they could have been copied and pasted identically.

They took both a clean and dirty urine sample, and they prescribed me some fluconazole, and told me I have a urinary track infection. So they started me off on 500 mg of cephalexin every 12 hours.     \n\nI felt like the cephalexin wasn\u2019t helping, but the UTI was relatively asymptomatic from the beginning. I didn\u2019t really have any urgency to urinate or burning. The fluconazole wound up being useless for the yeast and it kept multiplying and camping inside of me without any discharge at all. \n\nThen, Friday July 14th evening I get a call back from the urgent care that my culture results came back from quest. It tested positive for 50,000-100,000 CFU/mL of enterococcus Faecalis. It was susceptible to ampicillin with an MIC of <=2, vancomycin with an MIC of 1, and resistant to tetracycline. I am allergic to fluoroquinolones, but ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin had similar MIC\u2019s. \n\nSo the urgent care decided to write me a prescription for 100 mg of nitrofurantoin every 12 hours for a week.  At the same time I was complaining to the PA/provider over the phone about kidney pain, and he told me not to be worried. That Friday, the whole day, I had pain in my kidneys that became more frequent and felt like a dual radiating ache in the right kidney. Friday night the pain spread to the left kidney and was hurting a lot and I had developed a low-grade fever for the first time, so I decided to go to the emergency room and they gave me ceftriaxone through IV and discharged me the same night soon after. My blood work came back fine, except for elevated ionized calcium in my blood and slightly elevated white blood cells and leukocytes. The urine culture came back fine. There was no growth of bacteria and my CT scan showed no pyelonephritis.\n\nSo I stuck on the nitro and realized it wasn\u2019t helping, i developed new symptoms stabbing pain in bladder and pain when urinating and leaking urine all day, so July 17th night I went to the emergency room again where they gave me 3 g of ampicillin through an IV and prescribed me amoxicillin 500mg three times a day. They again did a culture and another CT scan and more bloodwork and all of it came back normal. I followed up with an infectious disease doctor on July  20th who asked me if I want to be admitted for a few days to get IV or not, but he told me he thinks I can beat it with antibiotics. The only change he made is that he put me on 500mg of amoxicillin FOUR times a day for FOURTEEN days. \n\nFor the yeast I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gone it\u2019s asymptomatic unless I tried to scrape it out and then it bleeds and causes painful urination. I took brexafemme for it and have been taking monistat 7 everyday if it will do anything. \n\nI legit have no clue what the hell to do, I\u2019ve been on 1500mg of amoxicillin everyday since July 18th and switched to 2000mg of amoxicillin everyday since July 20th. I still have aching stabbing kidney pains/back pains and flank pain to the touch that come and go. I still have a low grade fever almost nonstop which only goes down to normal temperature at night. I sit in A/C all day and my hands and feet freeze yet feels like my face is burning and my temperature typically sits around 99.5 all day. Some lymph nodes in my neck feel swollen and sore some days. \n\nI am losing my mind over this and not sure if hospitalization and IV treatment is the answer. I\u2019ve been having so much stress and anxiety about this that maybe that\u2019s contributing towards fever and not recovering. But I\u2019m trying everything I can- no smoking no drinking no dairy other than yogurt. Limit fatty foods. I am tracking my temperature every 30 min to see if it correlates to when I take antibiotics (it doesn\u2019t). I wake myself up in the middle of the night to take my next dose of antibiotics on the dot. But literally nothing is improving, I\u2019m stagnant with low grade fever and kidney pains and average fever seems to slowly get worse/higher as the days go on. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any chance the Quest urine culture somehow missed a bacteria?",

Please let me know if more information is needed and I'll answer questions:\n\nYears ago, I was seeing an allergist and getting weekly shots for yeast/mold/dust allergies. I occasionally still ate bread, and I was always coughing afterwards especially with burger buns. I stopped when I had to deal with some mental health issues.\n\nThe day after the skies turned orange from the Canada fires, my throat was sore. I didn't realize my window was slightly ajar, and I had breathed in the outside air overnight. I was coughing up phlegm, and I struggled to fall asleep. My GP prescribed cough gels, and those helped a little bit.\n\nI scheduled to see a new allergist. I did the prick test to be safe, and everything came back with zero reactions. My allergist said my lungs were clear, but my throat was super inflamed and red. He deduced that it wasn't a coincidence that my throat hurt so much after the forest fires. He told me to continue the cough gels and prescribed two types of nasal sprays. I immediately got better to my relief.\n\nHe also found it strange that my past allergist said I have a yeast/mold allergy. Out of curiosity, I ate a burger and went into a coughing fit that eventually went away. I can drink beer, so I feel like it's something else in the buns.\n\nLast week, I went to see my allergist because the coughing issue came back again. The day after I went out with friends to a food festival, I went back to my coughing fit. I went back on the coughing gels and nasal spray, and it wasn't working like before. The air quality was slightly bad that day, so I wondered if this was just how it was going to be moving forward.\n\nI was doing job interviews remotely, and I was coughing the whole time. It's annoying.\n\nMy allergist seemed stumped and said my throat was inflamed again. We talked about the foods/drinks I had at the festival, and he asked if there were any foods/drinks I don't like or tend to avoid. We scheduled for blood work with a bunch of additional allergens.\n\nThe tests came back all negative. The only one the lab couldn't do was chicken meat, but I doubt it. I eat chicken meat ALL the time, both home cooked and fast food. I was recommended to seek a second opinion with a throat/nose specialist, and that appointment is coming up in 2 weeks. I don't even know how helpful this would be. Is there anything specific I should be asking this specialist? Should I be seeing a different type of doctor?",

Tired all of the time and it\u2019s ruining my life.\n41, female, 198lbs, history of debilitating insomnia, low energy, sleeping and napping but also have insomnia. Had some blood tests done 4 months ago calcium was 167.9 diagnosed parathyroidism, nuclear imagine test didn\u2019t show any reaction, had an ultrasound done they found 3 nodules on my thyroid. Fine needle aspiration was inconclusive for cancers because the doctor couldn\u2019t find it and after digging in my neck for 20 minutes I asked him to stop. Going in for a second opinion. I honestly don\u2019t care about the nodules, I don\u2019t want to lose my thyroid gland and be tired for the rest of my life. I just want my parathyroidism corrected. The chances of me having cancer are so slim I just want them to observe it for a while. All of my tests for thyroid were perfect.\n\nCurrently taking weekly vitamin D 50000, vitamin B and iron, and Trazodone 50mg to help me sleep.\n\nSleep ranges 2 to 4 hours before waking. At home sleep study didn\u2019t show any signs of sleep apnea. I don\u2019t jolt awake, my resting heart rate is around 60-65 when waking. I usually wake up to go pee.\n\nFrom what I read having very high levels of calcium in your blood is a bad thing which can cause a whole basket of issues of left untreated. I\u2019m already having bone and joint pain. The doctors I saw jumped straight to total removal of my thyroid plus any parathyroids causing issues. Wouldn\u2019t even discuss anything else. His thinking was he didn\u2019t want to have to cut me open twice. Even if I had no intention of surgery he ignored my parathyroid issue to focus on my nodules. \n\nThe doctor that did my FNA even questioned what my endocrinologist said and when he stuck the needle in, he couldn\u2019t find the nodule and kept asking the nurse where it was? He wanted to do that 12 times, I stopped him and left. He left a huge bruise on my neck and he didn\u2019t numb me properly. It hurt for over 2 weeks.\n\nI honestly just want my high calcium issues addressed and to observe the nodules over time. I wasn\u2019t even given this option thus why I\u2019m getting a second opinion.\n\nAny advice for me? I\u2019m not getting anything to lower the calcium levels if there even is such a thing. I am so sick of being tired all of the time.\n\nThank you.",

They've done multiple tests including MRI, EKG, and EMG to rule out issues related to stroke, heart, etc. I have normal BP, a slightly lower-than-average heart rate, and I'm generally healthy. I usually work out about 5-6 days/week for 60-90 minutes a session, primarily lifting but I do try to mix-in about 30-45 minutes of cycling every other session. I did have a spinal fusion over ten years ago for kyphosis, but x-rays and the like recently have said it looks to be in good order (hardware is solid, no malformities, etc.) The only medication I'm currently on, including supplements, is Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism/slow thyroid. \n\nI originally thought I had been having a stroke at work last year as I'd lost my vision in my right eye/got intense auras where it was impossible to focus on that side. They discharged me from the ER that same day and diagnosed it as an ocular migraine. It came on after what I think was excessive caffeine use (multiple energy drinks in a short window), so I quit caffeine for a few months afterwards yet still experienced and continue to experience the residual weakness in the face/shoulder/calf on my right side. These symptoms persist on and off, usually 3 to 4 times per week. I haven't had those auras/tunnel vision symptoms since.\n\nThe weakness was noticeable by my PCP during a checkup when I mentioned it and did a reflex check, and I also notice it when lifting as it seems my right-side struggles a bit more than my left despite being the dominant side. \n\nUnfortunately, I've not gotten a particular good answer from doctors about what it could be. They've ruled out the very-serious issues above but haven't given me a determination of what it *is*, only what it *isn't*. \n\nCould this be something as simple as a pinched nerve exacerbated by exercise? Sometimes I feel my neck \"pop\" on the right side if I turn a certain way, although it hasn't happened in quite a few months, so I'm curious if that's related. Otherwise, I'm at a loss and I'd love to maybe get pointed in the right direction by someone who's experienced this or seen someone with similar symptoms.\n\nThank ya!\n\n&#x200B;",

I have had gastrointestinal symptoms for years. I have seen my GP for this and she did some tests. She couldn't find anything wrong and eventually diagnosed me with IBS. I have just learned to live with my symptoms. But now I am wondering if there could be something wrong with my pancreas.\n\nA couple of months ago I started going to an orthomolecular therapist. I went there because I have long covid and I want to try everything to get better (GP only offered physical therapy). I have greatly improved since last year (but I am not fully recovered). Recently I went there again, he did some tests and told me he suspected my pancreas might not be doing its job properly (I believe he said it did not make enough enzyms but I could be mistaking) and prescribed me some enzyms I should take. Now I have been looking up a bit about the pancreas and it does seem to fit with my symptoms. I want to know if it's worth going to my GP for this or if it is unlikely and I'm just being paranoid.\n\n**Personal information**:29F - Dutch1.70 meter62 kiloI do not smoke. I do drink, but only occasionely.\n\n**GI-symptoms:**\n\n* Fatty, sticky, floating, loose stool (sometimes very foul smelling)\n* 1 to 5 bowel movements per day. 1 is very rare and means i feel good. I'd guess 2 or 3 is common for most days? (and if its relevant: for a long time 1 per day was normal, but last couple of years it has increased to a couple of times per day)\n* Tummy aches: sometimes it's not too bad, sometimes it is. Sometimes going to a toilet helps, sometimes it really doesn't.\n* Flatulation\n* Blown up belly (it can look as if i'm several months pregnant)\n\nThese symptoms vary from day to day. Sometimes (unfortunately not often) I'll feel quite alright and sometimes i have a lot of symptoms. Most days I do at least have a couple of symptoms. Last couple of weeks it has been quite bad. The aches and diarrhea-like-stool is bothering me the most.\n\n**Other medical info:**I have long covid (since January 2022) and I might have endometriosis (which was given as a possibly diagnoses by a gynecologist, but has not been proven). I had a bad case of mono about 9 years ago after which I have not been the healthiest of persons (before mono I rarely ever got sick). Before long covid hit me I was feeling quite well, apart from the GI-symptoms. I actually ran a marathon a couple of months before. I have a big list of long covid-symptoms, but at the top of the list are: exhaustion, brain fog and easily overstimulated. I also have a couple of allergies (no food allergies i'm aware of).\n\n**Family History**On my moms side there are some gallbladder issues:\n\n* Great-grandmother first had some issues with her gallbladder and later her liver which caused her death. I don't know any details, she died in 1959 so this is a long time ago.\n* Grandmother: had her gallbladder removed due to gallstones\n* Mother and uncle: have gallstones\n\n**Medicines:**The pill and some supplements:vitamine D ( i have a deficiency)Enzymes (just started with these)PQQ meta plus (b12, q10, zinc and jiagoulan)Resveratrol\n\n**Test results** (from february 2023)Here are a couple of test results. Some are a bit low or high. Some are normal but might be relevant to my question (but NAD so not sure haha)Glucose 4,4 mmol/l (normal)Vitamine D: 41 nmol/l (low)SG urine: 1,007 (low)Leuco's urine: 34,3 \u00b5l (high)Alat: 19 U / l (normal)Asat: 19 U / l(normal)Biluribine: 4  \u00b5mol/l (normal)Not lactose intolerant, They checked for a couple of parasites but didn't find any.

With 2 months break in may but started again this week. and am curious about its potential implications on other treatments and activities. I did this therapy because I have VITLIGO and it helped reduce my vitiligo on my body A LOT it\u2019s not completely gone but I got patches of my original skin tone on my feet, hands, legs. \nPlaces that are notoriously hard to treat with vitiligo. I got mine because I was very stressed out \n\nI'm now considering a vitiligo treatment using a medication called Opzelura (ruxolitinib), and I'm wondering if my past leech therapy might have any impact on this or other treatments. The side effects for this cream are very serious and deadly. \n\nMoreover, I'm interested in knowing if there are any therapies, treatments, or activities that I should avoid because of my previous experience with leech therapy.\n\n\nAny experiences, thoughts, or information would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you in advance.",

My training partner went to \u201csweep\u201d my foot (kicking my foot up off the mat with his foot to take me down to the mat). I lifted my foot to avoid his, planted it back on the mat, and immediately slipped in sweat and my leg twisted behind me and I landed on it hearing/feeling a \u201ccrunch\u201d but no pop. I laid in the mat and an ER nurse with trains there came over felt around my leg and put me in a makeshift splint with a cardboard box and athletic tape. I went to the ER. They did multiple X-rays. The doctor there said I fractured my proximal fibula via a spiral fracture but that it was minor and I had a bad ankle sprain. Their X-ray report of my ankle says there is no fracture or dislocation in it. They gave me crutches and a short term ankle and leg brace to be replaced when I went for follow up with ortho.\n\nThe next day I went to see an orthopedic surgeon. They did a quick physical exam, then did a stress x-ray by moving my ankle under the X-ray while I laid down. There was no additional pain felt in my ankle when this was done. They said I had ligament instability in my ankle and would need to have a plate and screws surgically inserted. They wanted surgery for two days later. No MRI or other test were done, I was put in a splint and I was sent on my way.\n\nMy primary care physician asked if an MRI was ordered. I said no. They believed one should be done prior to going right to surgery. I sent a message to ortho letting them know what my primary said and asked if they thought it would help based on their experience. It was read but never replied to. Primary care doctor ordered an mri and sent a referral to another orthopedic surgeon who specializes in foot and ankle injuries and is one of the best in my area, working as the foot and ankle consultant for our local professional sports teams and division one university sports teams. I have an appt with him early this upcoming week.\n\nWhen I called the first ortho to reschedule the surgery, prior to the surgery not the day of, due to my primary care physician\u2019s referral and the person driving me to the hospital not being able to the day of the surgery, the person I spoke with seemed to get upset and said I should be grateful they were able to schedule the surgery and that if it\u2019s not done within 10 days of the injury surgery will be harder and they likely won\u2019t help me. I was then told I have a Maisonneuve fracture in my ankle. I said that wasn\u2019t said to me when I was there (and I found it odd I was only directly told after calling to reschedule the surgery). They said I must have been overwhelmed and so they canceled the surgery and scheduled a follow up but said I\u2019d have to have the surgery the day after the follow up.\n\nAm I wrong for wanting a second opinion? And if I don\u2019t do surgery within ten days (it happened this past Tuesday night) will it really make surgery worse? I\u2019m not wanting to be difficult, and if I need surgery they I need it and will do it, but I want to make sure first. And I have a really good, and long standing, relationship with my primary. I trust them. So I went for the MRI she ordered and I\u2019m inclined to get the second opinion. Does anyone have any suggestions or information which might make things clearer for me? And thank you in advance. Just really stressed about surgery.",

Realize my mistake and it is fixable but this injury may not be. I am a powerlifter hoping to compete this Sept 30 for my last junior level competition. Have had no pain for about two weeks in day to day life and doctor said I could resume training if I am careful. Have been doing McGill big three and back extensions (+ a lot of walking) for the past 4 weeks. Today after waking up my back felt just a bit stiff but didn't think nothing of it. Went to squat just 60kg and didn't feel pain but discomfort and lack of flexibility. I did feel pain however when slouching and bending over though (did on purpose without weight, just to test if I still felt pain there) -- similar to a Jefferson curl (see second link). Still feel it about 6 hours later.\r  \n\r  \nI have no radiating pain but very occasionally I feel a twinge down my right leg. In hot showers, the pain or any discomfort disappears 99.9% and I can put my back through many positions without pain. If only I could squat in the shower lol\r  \n\r  \n**I am getting an epidural injection for the pain next week but still have time to decide if I should or not.** 2 doctors have said that I can continue training (carefully) but I am scared to have any sort of pain as I can only imagine what happens when I put a lot more weight on it. I mean the injection can't really hurt if it's only one and it's been shown to be effective for lumbar disc herniations (just pain management). With it I hope to be able to train more consistently although more carefully and will not be deadlifting. Squatting has never been an issue with my lower back but this injury from another movement is causing slight problems. I honestly do not think squatting will cause a reherniation as I have gotten out of some pretty ugly squats in the past with my lower back doing a lot of the work (low-bar squatter) and have always felt fine and never close to a strain or herniation. I do not know if the disc is now much more susceptible to reherniation or not -- which would change things.\r  \n\r  \n\r\r  \n**I am asking advice on if I should get the injection and your experiences with it for mild back pain**. Also if you have **any tips** (besides resting, because rest is not the best for herniated discs) **for dealing with, training with, or training around this sort of pain**. Any advice in general about herniated discs and training is really welcomed :) Thank you.",

I have had sensitive teeth for years now and haven't seen a dentist in 5+ years due to fear and anxiety.

They filled it in and filled in a bunch of other cavities. They said I might need a root canal and I got scared and never went. Its been years later and I sometimes get terrible tooth pain in the back of my jaw from both sides. Sometimes it goes away on its own and other times I have to take something for it. I'm trying to find a dentist to see asap about this because someone told me if left untreated the infection can be so bad it can go to your brain and you can die. I also saw a greys anatomy episode where after the root canal the infection spread in other places and she got sepsis. I'm just so terrified right now.

I was drugged for most of it, probably some kind of pain killer or sedative. I was also often left with physical trauma and regularly had tearing and bleeding. \n\nWhen I was about 10 I got my period, but I thought it was just from my abuse, so I didn't realize. Thus, no one knew. When I was 11, I had (what I now know as an adult) a miscarriage by myself. I had no idea I was pregnant so I didn't tell anyone. Some people had started to comment on my stomach growing, making jokes about me getting fat and looking pregnant. But I had no sex education or knowledge at all of biology, so I was just confused. Anyway, I'll spare the details unless they are needed, but I passed a fetus and a LOT of blood and tissue. The fetus was kind of deformed and the color was kind of purple, the head still had a kind of lima bean shaped with black dots (?) for eyes. It had legs arms and the beginning of nubs for toes and fingers. It was about the size of my palm, maybe a little smaller. I am wondering if by that description anyone would be able to give an estimate for how far along I was? I bled pretty heavily for three days and just faked a stomach bug. \n\nMy next question has to do with my health now. I have VERY painful menstruation. It feels like blood just collects in my organs and feels like they are going to burst. The lighter my period is, the more it hurts. The only thing that's ever helped some us being on the birth control pill. I've had pelvic ultrasounds, and I do have ovarian cysts but no evidence of abnormal endometrial tissue. My hormone levels also suggested PCOS, so that is what they diagnosed me with. My obgyn also has commented that I have one of the smallest cervix openings she has ever seen. She was like visibly shocked the first time she examined me. \n\nAlso, the first time I had PIV sex as an adult (24 years old), my hymen was already broken and damaged from childhood, so there was no tearing there, but my vagina inside was like ..blocked? It took a while and a lot of force to actual get my inner vaginal cannal to open. It was not vaginismus, as I've experienced that. My muscles where very relaxed and it wasn't a lubrication problem. It was like an internal blockage. Once I finally got past it, there was almost like a popping sensation and a LOT of blood. But after that, no problems with PIV sex. \n\nOne other thing I should mention is I have memories of being hospitalized for a few days with some kind of vaginal injury as a kid, maybe 6 years old, I definitely had some kind of surgical procedure under anesthesia. I remember my parents telling the doctors it was due to a bike accident. Unfortunately, all of my medical records were wiped at the hospital so they can give me no information (long story).\n\nThanks for reading all of that. Does anyone have any feedback for me?

I\u2019m waiting to see a neurologist, but in the meantime saw an Ophthalmologist, who diagnosed me with optic nerve swelling in both eyes, but worse in the left. She wasn\u2019t sure of the cause, told me to keep waiting to see Neurologist.\n\nAbout 3 weeks ago, I started feeling kinda feverish occasionally, I have an annoying tick/spasm above my left eye, and extreme fatigue. I mean *extreme*, like I\u2019m randomly just falling asleep. Generally just feel absolutely worn down & awful.\n\nThen things got weirder about two weeks ago. I started feeling HUGE degrees of low back pain. I can\u2019t stand up for more than a few seconds before it starts to feel like my lower back is being crushed from the back in a kinda downward diagonal direction. When that hits, it\u2019s like my heart goes nuts with palpitations. If I can\u2019t sit down right away, then my chest hurts. I think it\u2019s just from how bad the pain is, and I have a massive pain tolerance! I\u2019m an amputee, I KNOW pain and this is BAD.\n\nFinally, last week, while I was in the bathroom I suddenly felt like something was partially blocking me as I was peeing. Kind of like when you put a thumb up against a faucet and the water spurts out sideways. That lasted a second or so, then I felt like I was being sliced open on the inside, then BAM. The dam broke and I could pee normally, but damn it hurt! And there was some blood. \n\nEver since that happened, on top of everything else, I\u2019m having baaaad pain in my flanks, like someone\u2019s digging their fingers into my kidneys. Fevers are worse, lymph nodes are huge & hard, especially in my neck.\n\nThinking I passed a stone or something, I went to see a urologist. (STILL waiting on Neurology; not till August. Ugh. Not sure why it\u2019s such a delay.) The Urologist was super rude, insisted before he even heard my symptoms that I have interstitial cystitis. But he kept going on about \u201cfrequency & urgency\u201d, which\u2026 I don\u2019t have. Told me I \u201cjust need to stop drinking so much caffeine & artificial sweeteners.\u201d No clue where he got that from, cause I\u2019m allergic to both & avoid them like the plague. The more I think about it, I wonder if he had someone else\u2019s chart or something, cause nothing he said made any sense.\n\nBasically at this point it feels like my symptoms are all over the map, so I have no clue who to see or where to go.

Details inside.\nSummary of medications and procedures:\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \nAumentin - 7 day course + 3 additional days\n\nDoxycycline - 7 day course\n\nClindomycin - 7 day course\n\nRocephin - IV antibiotics\n\nX-Ray\n\nUltrasound  \n\\----------------------------------------------------------------  \n\n\nOn June 27th, 2023 I wash bitten by my pet cat on my right index finger where the finger meets the palm. In total, there were 4 significant puncture wounds, two on the palmer side, and two on the back. Patient (I) immediately washed the affected area with soap and water and dressed the wounds with banadages. Within an hour, the finger became inflamed. Not knowing about the severity of cat bites, I went to bed that night expecting the swelling to subside. When it was still swollen in the morning, I decided to go to Urgent Cate (not the ER) after I got off work that evening. That evening, at Urgent Care, the NP examined the finger and reached the same conclusion I had made myself - bacterial infection due to cat bite resulting in cellulitis of the finger, and I was prescribed a 7 day course of Augmentin. I reprimanded myself for not acting sooner, and considered it a hard lesson learned about cat bites. I went home and began my antibiotic regimen, thinking my finger problem would be gone within the week.\n\nSeven days later, to the credit of the antibiotics, the swelling had decreased a bit, but the finger was clearly still swollen and there was still some throbbing pain, so I returned to Urgent Care. I expressed my concerns at this point that there might be something more significant going on with my finger. The NP (a different one this time) examined my finger again, told me that sometimes antibiotics take longer, and prescribed me 3 more days of Augmentin. I left this time unsatisfied.\n\nTwo days later (July 6th, 2023) I made up my mind to go to the emergency room. On the way, my partner suggested (and managed to convince me) to instead go to a nearby Prompt Care instead. Even though I was certain I would receive the same response, I obliged (the reasoning was to save money, even though my insurance would have covered the ER visit). Prompt Care NP looked at my finger, once again. At this point, I had done more research on my own, and my own armchair diagnostic was that I had managed to get a case of flexor tenosynovitis, though I wasn't 100% certain, because I did not meet all four of the Kanavel criteria for a accurate diagnosis. For one, the entirety of my finger wasn't swollen, just around the proximal phalange, and I mistaken assumed that I was able to fully extend the finger without any real pain (I was incorrect on this point.)   \n\n\nI shared my self-diagnosis with the NP, who took me to get X-Rays done of my finger. The findings of X-Rays are as follows:  \n\\-----------------------------------\n\nFindings: The bony structures are intact and normally aligned. The joint spaces are preserved. Soft tissue swelling is seen in the proximal aspect of the index finger.  \n\n\nConclusion: No acute osseous abnormality. Soft tissue swelling in the proximal index finger. No definite foreign bodies are present.  \n\\----------------------------------  \n\n\nIn addition to the X-Ray, this NP prescribed me a 7 day course of Doxycycline, and set me up with a referral to a recommended \"hand specialist\". I left with a little relief, as at least now I would be able to get a hand specialist to confim my suspicions of flexor tenosynovitis or at the very least give me a conclusive reason as to why my finger was still swollen. I called to set up an appointment with the hand specialist and it went to voice mail. I left my name and number and for 2 whole days I did not receive a call back. I was now frustrated at this point, as I had not yet had a definitive answer as to why my finger was swollen, the antibiotics were no longer showing any signs of affect, and I couldn't get ahold of the hand specialist.  On July 14th, 2023, I had reached my breaking point, and drove myself to the nearest ER.  \n\n\nAfter a 7 hour wait (understandable), I was finally face to face with an actual doctor. Took one look at my finger, and after I explained the series of events and my own self diagnosis, he began testing for the 4 Kanavel signs. Turns out, when I was testing for the pain on extension sign, I clearly wasn't pushing hard enough, because when he did it, it was painful. He also scheduled an X-ray, and their X-ray confirmed what the Prompt Care X-ray showed, as mentioned above. At this point, he called for an orthopedic surgeon to come look at my finger. While flexor tenosynovitis was the suspected culprit, the orthopedic surgeon noted that if it was that, that it was strange for the swelling to be localized to just around the proximal phalange, and not the whole finger (sausage finger). He scheduled an ultrasound to be done on my finger later in the week. I was also at this point prescribed a 7 day course of Clindomycin, and was also given IV antibiotics (cefTRIAXone ((Rocephin)). Here is the relevant clinical summary of the attending physician:\n\n\\------------------------------  \nMusculoskeletal: There is focal swelling of the right index finger between MCP and PIP. there is point tenderness. He can range the finger in both flexion and extension. Hyperextension does recreate pain in the finger between the MCP and the PIP. There is no palmar induration or tenderness to examine.\n\nGiven the persistence of swelling on the patient I did consult with orthopedic surgery despite not being an overt tenosynovitis. The consulting doctor was kind enough for ED consultation this morning and feels with the focality of the patient's pain the best management strategy is broadening antibiotics with close follow up which he will provide in his clinic.\n\nPatient previously on Augmentin though it was 500/125 TID for 7 days. Patient is now on doxycycline 100 mg PO BID. Usually this would be combined with clindamycin and that was started in ED as well as a large dose of 3rd generation cephalosporin. The consulting doctor will see the patient in his clinic in 1 week.\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\nOn Wednesday of this week, I went to see the consulting orthopedic doctor, who examined the finger and looked at my finger on the ultrasound. At this point I had more knowledge of flexor tenosynovitis in my head than I ever wanted, and expected to see the cause of my swelling and continued pain show up on the ultrasound in the form of an abscess or pus. I had mentally prepared myself for the ortho doc to confirm my suspicions and tell me that I would have to have surgery to drain the pus out of my finger.\n\nThis did not happen. Ultrasound did not discover any signs of an abscess or any signs of pus. Ortho doc says he has no reason to operate on my finger, because there is nothing to drain. Doc sent me home and told me to continue taking the antibiotics I was prescribed. When I asked then, \"why is my finger still swollen?\" I was not given a conclusive answer - only that injuries on the extremities, especially the hands, can sometimes take a while to heal. I was recommended alternating hot and cold soaks of my finger to see if that would help with the swelling, which is something I've been doing since this whole ordeal started, anyway.\n\nCurrently, the finger is still swollen around the proximal phalange, and from my untrained eye, it seems to be about as inflamed as it was 2 weeks ago. I cannot clench my fist. The index finger is still held in partial flexion. For a mental image, if I attempt to make a hook shape with my index finger, I am unable to do so. I feel pain at the base of the proximal phalange and even a bit around the metacarpal bone of the index finger when i apply significant pressure.\n\nIn summary, I am no closer today of knowing exactly why my finger is still swollen, and the general consensus of all the nurse practitioners and doctors I have talk to is to wait and see. Which, to be clear, is fine *if that is indeed the best course of action.* And that's all the information I have. Hopefully it was informative. I tried to include as much detail as possible. I will close this post with a collection of images of the finger. These were taken last week, but as far as I can tell, the finger looks the same today as it did then. \n\nUltimately, what I'm looking for in a reply here is if the \"Wait and see\" option is the correct course here. I'm wondering if somebody missed something. It has been swollen for nearly a month now, and I have bombarded this finger with a multitudinous payload of antibiotics, and they don't seem to be doing anything.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my post.\n\n[Image 1 - Front of finger](https://imgur.com/a/ixRNg4C)\n\n[Image 2 - Back of Finger](https://imgur.com/a/KNx0row)\n\n[Image 3 -  Side of finger / how far it can currently bend](https://imgur.com/a/f76Z0Hu)\n\n[Image 4 - Side of finger (attempt at holding all fingers in hyper extension)](https://imgur.com/a/SdOuDJu)\n\n[Image 5 - Left Hand side view for comparison of left index finger and right index finger.](https://imgur.com/a/QX4AHOr)  \n",

        "context": "How to Manage a Pinched Nerve in Neck/Shoulder at Work?\nHello, I (25F) am currently dealing with what I believe is a pinched nerve. \n\nThis recent bout of pain started as soon as I got a job working at a grocery store. I do a lot of cashiering, and I constantly have to move my left arm to grab things. I cannot take any days off because my bf just lost his job abruptly and we won\u2019t be able to pay rent if I don\u2019t finish the pay period. I also can\u2019t see a doctor because I need all of my money for bills and don\u2019t have insurance (meaning they will ask me to pay upfront). \n\nThe pain is mainly near my left shoulder blade where it dips and meets my traps. The pain radiates around my shoulder and occasionally on the back left side of my neck. Numbness will radiate down my left arm, specifically when I\u2019m trying to gwt rest at night and I lay on my back. Less so when I lay on my opposite side, but it\u2019s still uncomfortable enough to keep me awake. \n\nI have been to PT twice for an issue with my hip joint on the same side. The first time I was being treated for sciatica and the second time for SI Joint Inflammation. I\u2019ve had no imaging, but an x-ray that shows L5 sacrialization on the left side. Not sure if this is relevant, but I read that a joint issue on one part can affect how the other joints overcompensate so I wanted to add that just in case.\n\nI also injured my neck doing a dance back in 2020 and was unable to move it properly for months. The pain didn\u2019t go away fully until about 6 months later. I didn\u2019t go to a doctor for obvious reasons at the time. \n\nWhat can I do to manage this at home and at work to help treat it, or at the very least keep it from getting worse. I\u2019m even fine with just making it manageable for now, but I have no idea. All of the stretches online irritate it more and I feel like I can\u2019t rest. Ibuprofen only helped a little, not much unfortunately. Any suggestions would be appreciated!",

Every time I go pee only a little bit comes out.  I go back to bed and maybe 15 minus later the urge comes back. This happened a off and on during Thursday and Friday as well.  I just tried to ignore it and get some sleep, but I still got up at least 5 time each night.\n\nThere is no burning, discharge,  smell, discoloration, or anything, but I feel minor pressure in my lower abdomen when this occurs.  I have not changed my diet, exercise routine, or anything like that.  I drink Kombucha everyday to keep up my gut flora.  I also drank 2x as much water Friday than normal to try to flush things out so my pee was basically clear.\n\nSo, I was going to go to urgent care today (Saturday), but I sept though the night like a baby.  I had the lower abdomen pressure when I went to bed, but it was gone when I woke up today.  I got a good 9 hours of sleep and feel great today. Maybe some very very minor urge to pee, but I wonder if that's a phantom sense since I'm constantly checking if I still have the urge.  If I just don't think about it then there is no urge like previously.\n\nAnyways should I still go to urgent care? I would have to pay out of pocket if I did go.  All of my symptoms have basically disappeared since I woke up today.\n\nI'm thinking of buying some Cranberry juice and seeing what happens incase it's some minor UTI.  I have not had coitus with anybody for over a year, so it's not a STD.  I did masturbate Tuesday night before bed and the urges showed up Wednesday night so maybe something happened there.\n\nThanks for any advice.",

So scared and confused.\nI had a bilateral salpingectomy and have taken five positive pregnancy tests. Did my doctor mess up? Forget to do it and altered the chart? I am so confused.\n\nF32 5'3' 130lbs\nMedications: celexa (anxiety), Adderall (ADHD), potassium citrate (kidney stones)\n\nMy baby is 17 months and it was a very traumatic birth. I had cesarean scheduled at 39 weeks, but she decided to come earlier than that at 38 weeks. Unfortunately, that meant the on call doctor was going to deliver her. From several past bad experiences I didn't have confidence in her ability as a doctor, but baby is coming, so not really up to me. She complained to the nurse that she had to come in after dinner for me so I already had the impression her headspace was not where it needed to be. \n\nShe didn't look at my chart, or not closely to see that I had an anterior placenta. I hemorrhaged and they couldn't get her out for what felt like forever. I see a ton of people rushing in and when she's out she's not breathing and everyone is working on her. The doctor is doing all the rest of the stuff and when the sheet is moved her and the nurse's face are absolutely covered in blood. She was frazzled and very nervous. My baby comes around and by the 5 minute APGAR is at 9 instead of 1 and didn't even need to be in the NICU. I am so thankful and it was the scariest time of my life.\n\nBut my question is: could she have botched my bilateral salpingectomy? Could she have maybe forgotten to even do it? I know that doctors are used to high stress and what is scary to me may not be to them, but this person was obviously not ok. She was shaking and pale and very nervous when the curtain came down and I was stitched up. Or did she not see that I was to have a bi salp after delivery? If she looked at my chart, it wasn't very closely. I did mention it in the beginning to her, but with the scary event and the fact that she didn't seem very interested in what I had to say, I'm wondering if it was even done or done accurately. How could this happen? Can anyone offer insight into this? \n\nI did look up her reports to verify if it was done. They are not detailed at all. Doesn't mention a salpingectomy at all, glosses over the blood loss and even though it was more than 1800 she said it was \"no more than expected\" in her report. Didn't say anything about my baby not breathing or any mention of the placenta whatsoever. For being in there for 90 minutes, it was very, very short. \n\nLabs mention the fallopian tubes, but no detail besides the exact same descriptors for each, like they could have been copied and pasted identically. I am freaking out. I don't understand and I need to hear from professionals any likely scenario. I am NOT going back to that doctor. She will never treat me again.",

I have all 4 wisdom teeth, all of them are impacted to varying degrees, but they've never caused me issues so I've never bothered to get them out. All but one of them are at least partially erupted.\n\nStarting at least within the past two weeks(I can't really recall), my top left wisdom tooth has been pretty sensitive to cold, enough so that it hurts/stings if I swish around cool water. That tooth is erupted and I believe mildly impacted. It doesn't hurt at all otherwise, just sensitivity to cold. My overall dental health is honestly not the best, I'm not great at brushing twice a day, but last time I went to the dentist(about 6 months ago) I don't believe they found anything. That's of course before this problem started. I grind my teeth a lot, so this could be related.\n\nI'm really just wondering how likely it is that I can get out of this without any dental work. I don't have time for a full extraction right now, so I bought some sensodyne and hoping that works, and that this'll go away eventually. How possible is that?",

        "context": "Should I be concerned about type 2 diabetes\nHello! I am 27, female, BMI around 23. I have a past medical history of anorexia in which my bmi was as low as 16, but I have been in recovery for 4 years. I\u2019ve had 1 pregnancy that was uncomplicated with a healthy full term baby. I take 40 mg Prozac for anxiety, 60 mg vyvanse for ADHD, and PRN Ativan 0.5 mg, I probably take the Ativan on average 1/month for anxiety or insomnia.\n\nWhen I had an eating disorder and it was really bad, I would get these daily episodes of weakness, twitching, fatigue, and headache. This started after years of having anorexia. I had a grand mal seizure in 2017 due to deficient electrolytes. Although my numbers were not actually flagged as abnormal upon lab work at the ER, they were the lowest \u201cnormal\u201d value, my tox screen was negative, and I followed up with neuro which was negative for anything neurological so they said the seizure was from my ED. I never had another seizure. I figured these daily episodes were caused by hypoglycemia or dehydration.\n\nThese episodes did disappear after I regained weight and health. During the beginning of my recovery, I was pregnant so I was off of all medication and really trying to be mindful of my food and water intake. After having my son, I would sometimes get the episodes again especially after having caffeine on an empty stomach or not eating much all day. I again assumed it was low blood sugar.\n\nNow I have been on stimulants for ADHD for the past year and it has really improved my life. I am a new nurse, so the medication is really important to me so I can do my job thoroughly. I\u2019ve had no negative side effects such as nausea or loss of appetite. Sometimes I get heart palpitations if I drink caffeine near the time I took my Vyvanse, but that\u2019s about it. However, I\u2019ve recently been getting the episodes frequently again. I attributed it to the stimulants wearing off, which it likely could be a vyvanse \u201ccrash\u201d as they call it. I always take my medication with food, specifically protein, and be sure to eat and drink throughout the day. It doesn\u2019t seem to help the afternoon episodes.\n\nToday, I was out with family at a tea shop and I got a sugary drink (caffeine free) and a macaron. About an hour after eating, and while still finishing the drink, the \u201cepisode\u201d started. Headache, nausea, dry mouth, sweating. I got home and checked my glucose and it read 140. This I know is technically normal, but is it \u201cborderline\u201d? Should I, with these sx, be concerned about hyperglycemia? Sometimes sugar fixes the symptoms and sometimes it causes them. Not really sure what to think of this. Maybe I just need to drink way more water?",

Up until recently I have always had normal results for all three.\n\nMy TV ultrasound was done on 7/5/23. Last week Friday, 7/14/23 my gyno called me at 5pm with the results. She informed me I have two ovarian cysts in my left ovary. I was shocked because I haven't had any symptoms. My periods are VERY regular and have never been heavy. I was shocked and didn't ask questions. She said someone would call me to schedule a follow up ultrasound and I said okay. \n\nI looked at my file and these are the actual results: 4.9 and 2.8 cm hypoechoic left ovarian lesions, possibly reflecting hemorrhagic ovarian cysts. Follow up could be considered. the left ovary measures 4.9 x 6.2 x 5.3 cm, with 2 complex hypoechoic structures with multiple septations, including the 4.9 x 4.4 x 4.4 cm and a 2.8 x 2 x 2.5 cm. \n\nThis is when I started to panic.

Had 4 appointments in the last 5 years to remove buildup of earwax\n\n- Recently picked outer ear hairs with tweezers\n\n- I do not use Q-tips or touch my ear often, but recently have touching it more due to itchiness\n\n- I often grind my teeth in my sleep. My medications make me do this more.\n\n\n[Current medications]\n\n- Concerta 54mg\n\n- Prozac 30mg\n\n\n[Issue]\n\n- 3 weeks ago, felt itchiness as if ear hairs tickling my ear, so I purchased tweezers and picked the hairs from outer ear\n\n- 1 week ago, the problem didn't go away. Used a metal srynge filled with water to flush my ear. No change\n\n- 6 days ago, purchased a  camera tool to look inside of my ear. Found something that looks like a lump (cyst?). Images attached below\n\n- ~3 days ago, applied an antibiotic gel to the left outer ear\n\n- 1 day ago, reapplied the antibiotic gel\n\n- itchiness and odd feeling of pressure has not gone away as of today\n\n- Scheduled an appointment with an otolaryngologist, in ~2-3 weeks\n\n\n\n[Question]\n\nIs this issue urgent?

I had routine blood work in 2019 that showed mild hypercalcemia. Blood work was then repeated in 2020 showing the same. After the second case of this my doctor ran PTH, ionized calcium, and vitamin D blood work. This time calcium came back within range as did ionized calcium and PTHrP was low and PTH intact was low normal. Vitamin D showed I was deficient so doctor said this was probably the cause. Now 2023 just got routine blood work back and there it is hypercalcemia again fueling my anxiety. The results are detailed below I am extremely worried as of course have read online detailing that the only real 2 causes of this are parathyroid tumor(which was ruled out by PTH) and Cancer. \n\nCalcium\n10.5 - 2019\n10.6 - 2020\n10.3 - 2020\n10.8 - 2023\n\nIonized Calcium \n\n5.2 - 2020\n\nAlbumin -\n5.2 - 2019\n4.9 - 2020\nNot tested again in 2020\n5.3 - 2023\n\nPTH - 19 - 2020\nPTHrp - 13 - 2020\n\nI have read all on norman parathyroid website and they detail that the upper limit fo calcium is 10.7 for my age but results say different just looking for some information on this as I read that cancer tends to cause hypercalcemia in advanced stages and with a poor prognosis but I dont have any issues and have been living with this apparentely for 4+ years.\n\nThanks",

        "context": "Facial pain / osteoma (26m)\nHi guys. I\u2019ve had this chronic pain on the left hand side between my nose/sinus/teeth for years. The dentist ruled out a dental cause and suggested seeing an ENT.\n\nI had a scan done and the ENT said there was \u2018white\u2019 on the region of the scan and he didn\u2019t know what it was. So he referred me to another ENT department he thought could help.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t access his scan and to my recollection they ordered another one. They told me that they found an osteoma at the exact location of my pain, however they don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for an osteoma to cause facial pain. So they referred me to a pain clinic who said it was \u2018idiopathic facial pain\u2019 and probably neurological in origin. They said my best bet was seeing a \u2018pain psychologist\u2019 and taking nerve pain medication (which hasn\u2019t helped at all).\n\nI felt I wanted a second opinion on the osteoma and the pain, and finally got seen again by the ENT. They stated they couldn\u2019t access either of my scans, and had no record of the second scan and that it probably \u2018didn\u2019t happen\u2019 (it did). Nonetheless, he still was adamant that the osteoma couldn\u2019t cause facial pain and that pain psychology was the only treatment.\n\nNow, every study I have read states that sinus osteomas can and often do cause facial pain.\n\n\u2018The most common symptom of paranasal osteomas is pain including headache and facial pain (Atallah and Jay, 1981).\u2019 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319453411001044#:~:text=The%20clinical%20presentation%20of%20paranasal,Atallah%20and%20Jay%2C%201981).\n\nIt seems bizarre to me that there would be an osteoma at the exact location of the pain that\u2019s unrelated. What\u2019s even more bizarre to me is being told it can\u2019t cause facial pain when every study says it does.\n\nNow I\u2019m not certain this is the cause of the pain. However it confused me. Furthermore, I am not happy with the idiopathic/nerve diagnosis. They arrived at that from simply not finding another cause, and it really doesn\u2019t feel like a nerve problem to me (it feels very structural/physical, largely affected by pressure, I can feel/hear liquid/fluid opening closing etc).\n\nThey have stated they are going to try and locate the past scan, however that was from 4 years ago. I will pursue a new scan, but i am not convinced of whether the response will be any better.\n\nAny thoughts or advice would be useful!\n\nThanks",

Wednesday, I made sure I was definitely hydrated and drank around 2L+ just in the afternoon, but still had that extremely strong urine smell and noticed it looked much darker than it should having just drank that much water over a few hours. \n\nThursday afternoon, still having the strong urine, I started to feel like my bladder was still full after peeing. This is when I caught on that something definitely was not right and suspected a possible UTI but had no pain at all. I had possibly used the bathroom a little more than usual that day, though nothing drastically noticeable, but as the afternoon progressed I was peeing small amounts quite frequently with a lot of discomfort around my bladder area. \n\nI went and saw my GP who used one of those dip sticks and said my urine looked fine and that the stick only showed a very small amount of white blood cells. She sent it off for a urine culture test and gave me a script for antibiotics but told me not to take them until they get the results back on Saturday and will call me if it's positive for a UTI, unless it gets worse. \n\nThat brings me today,  Friday. My urine smelled strong this morning but is ok now. Around noon, I started to experience pain on both my sides and my back. I've not got my results back but bought and started the antibiotics (Cefalexin 500mg, twice a day). \n\nI haven't been feeling the bladder fullness since this morning or needing to pee since around noon. Throughout this whole experience, I've experienced no pain while urinating at all and have had no blood in my urine and I don't have a fever. \n\nAt the moment I'm mostly experiencing a sharp pain on my left side, with occasional pain on the right side. There is pain when I press on my left side. It gets worse when I walk and move around. \n\nWhile the pain started by being there pretty consistently on both sides while at work (mostly driving and standing), its now an on and off stabbing pain that lasts a few seconds while sitting or laying down, or consistently there when walking. \n\nThe pain isn't unbearable, if I get a bad stab it's maybe gotten to a 6 or so and makes me jump. It's mostly just really uncomfortable and annoying. \n\nOriginally I thought my UTI may have turned into a kidney infection but now I'm wondering if I have stones. I also started Aspen Dexamphetamine about 9 days ago, prescribed my by Psychiatrist for ADHD. No other medication or medical conditions other than PCOS.\n\nMy plan is to continue the antibiotics and go back to my doctor if it doesn't go away or to ER if the pain gets severe. \n\nAny thoughts?

So, when I was younger I had semi-frequent episodes of diarrhea, then in my late teens/early 20s I started frequently having to strain to have bowel movements but also getting intermittent diarrhea, then the diarrhea subsided aside from rare occasion and I progressed from just having to strain to have a bowel movement to having to rock back and forth/side to side, to sometimes having to insert my fingers in my rectum to digitally remove feces, to basically becoming dependent on digital removal and enemas to have a bowel movement by my mid-20s. \r  \n\r  \nI brought this up to my PCP who first suggested I try various OTC laxatives (which didn\u2019t really do much), then later referred me to a gastroenterologist who recommended fiber and put me on lactulose, which I tried for around a few months which either did nothing or a couple times gave me uncontrollable explosive diarrhea with no therapeutic range where I could just have a normal bowel movement. I finally got the GI doc to give me a colonoscopy which came back normal, so he told me to just continue with the fiber and laxatives which were already not helping, so I basically just gave up on getting professional help for a while.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m now almost 35 and trying to take my health more seriously, and as a registered nurse I know that what I\u2019m experiencing is not normal and needs further evaluation. I go on bouts (I know I should be more consistent but struggle due to the untreated ADHD, also on the waitlist for a behavioral health provider) of taking fiber, magnesium citrate, and pre-/pro-biotics which are helping some, and I\u2019m basically to the point where I can sometimes initiate a BM naturally (especially if I wait longer than usual/comfortable once I\u2019ve had the sensation that I need to go) but still not go completely without digital stool removal or using an enema for the rest.\r  \n\r  \nOther relevant information:\r  \n\\-My stool is usually medium-brown in color, soft-formed or mushy, rarely hard/pebbly, I often express clear mucus from my rectum with or without stool, occasionally thick whitish stringy material in stool itself, and I\u2019ve noticed that some of the time when I have a BM without assistance it is very narrow (around finger-width) and sort of flat as if my internal anal sphincter doesn\u2019t like to fully/easily open (often feels like this when I insert fingers as well).\r  \n\\-I often have BLQ abdominal tenderness to palpation.\r  \n\\-I do get rare shooting pain from my anus to my penis; only happened a handful of times or so and seems random/unrelated to bowel movements or assisted stool removal.\r  \n\\-I have a small nodule (maybe pen-tip size if that) in my posterior rectum about 1 inch in (appeared \\~1.5 years ago, is small, soft, and has not grown in size; assessed by a family practice doc who gave me a referral to infectious disease despite all my STI tests coming back negative, that office said I should get a referral to a colo-rectal specialist, so I told the ordering doc and he just never got back to me). I assume it\u2019s from all the mild trauma initiated by digital insertion, enemas, and occasional anal sexual activity (see below) but don\u2019t know for sure.\r  \n\\-I do \u201cbottom\u201d and use anal sex toys a few times a year and have done so since my early teens, but I frequently avoid such activities due to my GI issues.\r  \n\r  \nSorry for the long-winded post, but I have a physical w/ my PCP next month and hope to have some suggestions of what to explore/tell her and maybe some advice of what I can do on my own to help. This has been a major and shameful struggle in my life for well over a decade now, and I just want it to go away. Thank you in advance!\r  \n",

Around two months ago I started experiencing chest pain it started off low and increased in severity. After one day when I got angry I felt the pain radiate through my left arm all the way to my heart. I went to the ER and the ecg was normal but the attending physician heard my heart through a stethoscope and recommended seeing a cardiologist. \n\nAfter multiple tests with the cardiologist he said I had mild moderate mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation. However, he insisted that it has nothing to do with the chest pain and it is caused by stress and anxiety. He basically told me to go and speak to a psychiatrist. This was end of May, the pain has not gone away at all. I went to another cardiologist that said the same thing. I spoke to a third cardiologist and he said to take it easy and not move much but thats about it. The problem is that this pain is becoming debilitating and because it hurts I cannot stop thinking about it. \n\nThe pain can be described as a pressure in the heart or stabbing, my arm sometimes feels numb or sore. It is sometimes accompanied by nausea and lightheadedness as well as fatigue. All depends on the day somedays it can be bearable others not really. \n\nAny help about this is appreciated.  thank you",

I struggled with constipation and feeling like I was never finished when I went to the bathroom. I had mucus in stool and on the rare occasion that I would get pain from constipation lasting too long,  I would have these brief fainting spells or just feel really dizzy.\n\nMoving forward to now I've been suffering from stomach pain since the start of this year in my lower abdomen around my belly button and pelvis- mainly situated in the center and left side, constantly going back and forth between constipation and diarrhea, with nothing subsiding the pain aside from eating which slightly lessened it until I hurt even worse at night. Between the pain and the fatigue it brought with it, I've been unable to carry on with my usual activities and mostly find myself lying in pain for most of the day. I first went to my PCP who sent out abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds, as well as blood tests testing for celiac, all of which came back normal.\n\nUpon following up with my GI doctor I did a colonoscopy, in which I was unable to properly do the prep as the solution made me nauseous and so some areas were not clear. He told me however that my results were normal aside from some small hemorrhoids. I later did a H. Pylori breath test, as my dad had gotten it around this time, which came back negative. I recently did an endoscopy where a biopsy was sent which was found to be normal aside from mild gastritis, which brings me here.\n\nAside from potentially repeating the colonoscopy or doing a CT scan- which terrifies me because of the radiation- I don't know where to turn next, and hate that there almost seems to be no root cause to my symptoms. Has anyone else experienced anything similar, or potentially know what condition this may sound similar to? Could it really just be IBS? I'm so exhausted.",

Or just something somatic?\nF28, 160 cm, 70 kg\r  \nMedication: 2x20mg omeprazole, 1 one billion unit probiotic, and 3x60 mg alverine and simethicone daily for a colitis flareup (prescribed for a month, I\u2019m starting the third week), plus 1x500 mg extended release metformin, 2 myo-inositol, 1 vitamin D supplement daily, and .025mg cabergoline weekly to treat PCOS and elevated prolactin levels (prescribed for three months before checkup, also starting the third week)\r  \n\r  \nOn January I went to a GP about another colitis flareup, my main symptoms were bloating and starting to feel some fatigue. The GP only did a physical checkup, didn\u2019t ask for blood tests or other analysis. I complained mostly about pain/discomfort on my right side, right under the ribcage, and she told me she was ruling out liver problems on the basis alone that the pain didn\u2019t worsen in the area while she was feeling around. She prescribed me a week-long treatment and I felt a lot better.\r  \n\r  \nAround May I began experiencing a lot of stress and noticed I began bloating again, but due to financial problems I could only ignore it. It worsened with time, albeit slightly, and just at the beginning of July I was able to invest in getting checkups again.\r  \n\r  \nI started with a gynecologist due to some discomfort on my breasts, which to be honest caused me to panic and stress even more over the fear of it being breast cancer, but after an ultrasound and blood test, the doctor explained it was only an increase on my prolactin levels, a vitamin D deficiency and a couple of hormones having inverted values, as well as my insulin resistance flaring up again. I must admit I spent almost everyday at home until very recently, and my diet is/was not the best, so the vitamin D deficiency didn\u2019t really come as a surprise (from a baseline of =<30, I had 9.43). Still, the almost three-week waiting period raised up hell in my already uncomfortable gut.\r  \n\r  \nI took those blood work results to a gastroenterologist in case they were useful to her, since I read that vitamin D and prolactin are metabolized through the liver, but she disregarded them quickly. My symptoms were the same as the ones in January: I was uncomfortably bloated, spicy and greasy foods, which I had been honestly abusing lately, weren\u2019t sitting right with me and I had occasional diarrhea, although with no blood on sight. I also felt discomfort on my right side, right under my ribcage, again. During the physical checkup she also semi-ruled out liver problems, but still asked for a liver and bile duct ultrasound and a 32-element blood work to make sure.\r  \n\r  \nThe ultrasound report says: \"Moderate grade fatty liver, cholelithiasis without bile duct dilation\", and recommended to check certain values, which are as follows (I\u2019ll include the lab baseline values in parenthesis next to my values, since I live outside the USA and don\u2019t know if they vary):\r  \nAlbumin: 4.80 (3.97-4.94)\r  \nAlkaline phosphatase: 75.1 (35.0-104.0)\r  \nBilirubin: 0.57 (<=1.20)\r  \nALT: 32.9 (<=33.0)\r  \nAST: 21.9 (<=32.0)\r  \nGGT: 16.4 (<=40.0)\r  \n\r  \nThe ultrasound also recommended to check TP, TPT and prothrombin time, but my initial blood work didn\u2019t include it.\r  \n\r  \nThe gastroenterologist said she would let me know if it was necessary to go see her earlier when I sent my results, otherwise she would see me in a month. She only confirmed she had received my blood work and ultrasounds and didn\u2019t add anything else, so I\u2019m assuming I\u2019ll see her at the beginning of August.\r  \n\r  \nNow, starting on the third week of all the medicine I have to take, I\u2019ve noticed only small changes: I\u2019m not as bloated, but I\u2019m still bloated. I\u2019m not really feeling hungry (but I have to admit, I\u2019m also a very anxious person and normally during elevated anxiety periods I lose appetite completely). I burp after eating anything, no matter how little it is (for example, I burped after having two peach gummies the other day). My bowel movements go from slight constipation to slight diarrhea and they are consistently a soft brown color (I wouldn\u2019t call it clay-colored, but it\u2019s definitely lighter than my normal bowel movements). The general discomfort under my right ribcage has improved considerably, although when I get nervous/anxious I feel it. But now, every now and then, I feel little, very defined stabby pains in that area, instead of just general discomfort/ache. I would describe them as someone poking me with a sharp object. The pain lasts a few seconds at most and then goes away, but it leaves me scared. I\u2019m also sometimes dizzy and slightly nauseous, but haven\u2019t really thrown up during the treatment (and even before that, in a long time).\r  \n\r  \nNow, the thing is I don\u2019t know if these could be gallbladder attacks or the fatty liver acting up. Even if I go to sleep feeling those discomforts, I always wake up without them. Sometimes symptoms start shortly after waking up, but I\u2019ve noticed that happens only on days when I\u2019m feeling overtly-anxious and obsessively scanning my body. I can exercise without a problem and I\u2019ve noticed that even improves my overall perceived state. Still no blood on sight in my stool, and no traces of jaundice in my skin or eyes, although my eyes have also been very dry and kinda bloodshot, if that could be relevant?\r  \n\r  \nCould someone give me an insight of what could be happening? I must admit, again, that I have horrible health anxiety, so my fears range from gallstone attacks, to liver problems, to some sort of cancer (no other reason other than some blood values being so high while others are normal, though I admit I know nothing about it so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s truly an indication of something being severely wrong), so I don\u2019t know if I should go see another gastroenterologist sooner and push for an endoscopy/colonoscopy/something of the sort right now, or just wait a couple weeks more to see what my doc has to say. I\u2019d appreciate any comment.",

(1.5M)\nHello,\n\nMy son: 1 and a half year old male, 25lbs, 35 inches, white, no health issues other than constipation. \n\nI've posted before about my son's (1.5 year old) chronic constipation. My question is, how exactly does constipation happen in the bowels? If my son takes high enough doses of stool softeners and laxatives, he'll have one or two mushy poops per day. If he misses a dose or gets a smaller dose, the next day he will still poop, but it will be hard and small. The next day pebbles, and the day after that, he stops pooping altogether. When he gets back on the laxatives, he will go back and forth between pooping water and pooping pebbles until his stool gets back to normal consistency & frequency. \n\nHow could he go from soft wet poops to hard poops within a day? Wouldn't it need to be in his colon longer to get that hard? Does it mean that too much water is being pulled from his intestines? He doesn't seem dehydrated - he wets diapers well, has a wet mouth, cries tears, and drinks water all day long as well as milk bottles. He also eats lots of fiber. \n\nThank you! ",

I repeat words and phrases many times in my head after I utter them out loud which I never did before. The depth and breadth of my thoughts are shallow.

It's not something I could live with until recently and made plans to kill myself many times in the past 2 years because of it. I never followed through with the plans though. I've heard about depression induced pseudodementia and it sounds like a possible cause for my failing mental state. The shame and stress caused from confronting that part of my identity also made me physically sick for months and made my skin hypersensitive to touch and temperature as well.

I live in Southern California, I am a 5'7\" 140lb 27 Y/O Male who is very athletic. I eat clean, I exercise regularly, and take multivitamins. \n\nI was two months into the Sheriff academy when on the weekend of June 10th 2023 I got sick. Headache, nausea, chest congestion and an overall feeling of exhaustion. I've been sick before, so this wasn't alarming. I was coughing up yellow/green phlegm that following week, and was trying to dial it down but the intensity of the sheriff academy, my pride, and pushy instructors who don't \"allow you\" to be sick got the better of me, and I trained through it. Over the next few week I felt off but generally okay, all symptoms had subsided except I was coughing up green phlegm still, and I felt like I was operating at 70% capacity. I was still running 7-9 Miles at a 7 Minute flat pace, but I felt terrible doing it. At this time I was living in barracks housing, which was old, dirty, and there was mold present in some areas. \n\nFast forward a few weeks, I choose to remove myself from the academy for a variety of reasons, my wife and daughter needed me at home, my daughter is autistic and being away for weeks at a time was too hard on her, I was still sick, and ultimately I felt the job wasn't for me. Still coughing up green phlegm on Jun 26th I went to urgent care. The Physician I saw said I probably have bronchitis and prescribed the following:\n\ndoxycycline (MONODOX) 100 MG capsule (2 a day for 10 days)\r  \nalbuterol 108 (90 Base) MCG/ACT inhaler\r  \nmethylprednisolone (MEDROL DOSEPACK) 4 MG tablet (6-5-4-3-2-1 daily doses)\n\nI took 9 days worth of the antibiotic, but it was making me feel worse, and I skipped the last dose the 10th day. I took the steroid, as directed, with the exception of one day where I missed one of the four doses. \n\nAfter all that, I developed bad sinus pressure and nasal congestion, and the chest congestion was still present. I don't have the urge to cough, but when I exhale hard and deep, or \"Huff\" I can hear the crackling and can cough up the green mucus. Usually by the afternoon I feel halfway decent and most of my congestion has eased. But the next day I start all over again; plugged nose, green mucus, chest congestion, face pressure. I live at elevation and when I drive down the hill for work I get plugged up, ear pain, and sinus pressure. OTC stuff doesn't seem to help.\n\nI went back to the same urgent care on 7/14, the PA who saw me essentially told me to continue waiting it out, was very dismissive of me, and reluctantly ordered chest and sinus X-Rays of which I am still awaiting results.\n\nUltimately, as of today I am still sick, closing in on 40 days straight of CRAP! I have never been sick for this long in my entire life. Am I overthinking it? Do I just keep waiting? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nANY ADVICE IS GREATLY APPRECIATED, and I will promptly answer any questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks\n\n&#x200B;",

Though I'm looking to get some information to help deal over the weekend.\n\nI say I'm constipated, but I still poop everyday.  Though starting on Wednesday  I was not getting complete evacuation.  I would poop an ok looking log, but it felt more was in there that did not want to come out.\n\nWednesday night I could feel bloating and that poop was backing up.  This happened again Thursday with my morning poop not getting everything to come out.\n\nI have been eating healthy, exercising, and loss a bunch of weight this year.  I cut out all Alcohol, candy, soda, junk food, milk, ice cream, and really revamped my whole diet to be healthy.  I don't smoke, do drugs, or on any kind of medication.   I try to keep good gut health drinking kombucha for the probiotics and all that stuff.\n\nRecently in the last few weeks I've been concentrating on eating more fiber to bulk up my poops a little bit more as I felt they were a touch loose.  I may have over did it as this may have caused my constipation as I was not drinking enough liquids to offset the increase in fiber.\n\nA side effect of this constipation seems to be the need to pee often, though when I pee not a lot comes out.  This usually happens at night after dinner and gets worst while I'm trying to sleep.  It's to the point that I'm try to pee, I feel like I'm done, go back to bed and 5 minutes later I have the I need to pee feeling again.\n\nSo I was talking with a friend yesterday about my constipation and they said a salt cleanse helped them in the past to get things moving.  So I read up on that yesterday and it seemed simple enough to try.  I did it first thing this morning and boy did lots of poop and sludge come out.\n\nI probably pooped water on and off for 30 minutes. At the end the water was pretty clear so I felt like it did it's job.  I did instantly feel better the rest of the morning.  I ate a egg and avocado sandwich for lunch, 5 hours after pooping water, to keep things light and have drank lots of water and a Kombucha today to rehydrate for all that lost water.\n\nOne thing in particular is the need to pee often with not much coming out has not gone away. I have had that pretty much all afternoon and still have it now as I type this post.  I'm been doing some Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles the last hour and that seem to have help things a bit.\n\nI still feel like I have to pee, but it's more an annoying feeling of something in the chamber then I have to pee right now.  I'm not sure if this matter, but it's a data point.\n\nSo now one thing I did Tuesday night, that may be important, was have some bedroom fun with my girlfriend.  So now I enjoy edging and she loves taking the dominate role at times.  So on this night we went at it where she basically controlled when and how I would cum.\n\nWe got to a point where I was rock hard riding the edge as she was stroking me.  At one point I felt the urge to pee and I said I have to pee.  She played her dominate role and say no peeing.\n\nHonestly I kind of liked it. The urge to pee while riding the edge, felt great.  So I went with it and didn't use our safe word to stop.\n\nIf anything I felt even harder having to pee and riding the edge.  My girlfriend was loving it, even commenting how much harder I was than normal.  This lasted for at least 45 minutes before I ejaculated and my penis had this vibrating feeling that was out of this world.\n\nAt that point I still had to great urge to pee but I was rock hard from all of the stimulation.  This made peeing pretty difficult, but I pushed it out.  I will say pushing out the pee was not smooth in the sense that t was kind of stop and start peeing.   In hindsight this may have not been the best move.\n\nThough I noticed \\~15 minutes later when I was completely soft that I felt like I had to pee again.  I went and only a dribble came out.\n\nI tell you all this because that urge to pee feeling I get now, feels pretty much the same as that urge to pee after 15 minutes I just mentioned.  If I do pee more the a dribble then it's has this stop and stop feel to it as well when I try to relax the muscle holding the pee back.  I don't know if they are related or just coincidence, but I felt it was worth a note.\n\nAnyways if anybody has some advice fore getting through the weekend that would be great.  I have no idea what tomorrow will bring and if all my issues will just go away with a night of sleet, but I'm looking for an opinion / some advice.\n\nMy doctor's office did not think this was an emergency, so I should not have much to worry about, but this urge to pee is pretty annoying.   It's been a little over an hour since I last peed as the Kegel exercises I talked about above seem to setting things down.  It's more of a tingle now then an all out I have to pee.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions and I apologize for any bad grammar or spelling.  Thanks for any help.\n\n&#x200B;",

Did I have a penis removed at birth?\nPrimary Concern: I have an unknown scar, and am paranoid if it is from a surgery shortly after my birth.\n\nAge: 18  \nSex: Female (?)  \nheight: 166cm (\\~5'6'')  \nweight: 48kg (106lbs)  \nrace: chinese\n\nI have a vertical scar that is a perfectly straight line from right below my bellybutton to my vaginal area (as far as I can tell). I think it would be classified as normotrophic? The scar's not raised or textured, but noticably darker and looks similar to when I get minor wounds and after they've completely closed up, but are still visible as temporary scars (lasting maybe a few months). \n\nI have had this scar for my whole life, have never had a surgery relating to anywhere on my torso or reproductive parts, and never sustained severe injuries in this region. My bellybutton has no irregular scarring or shaping, so I don't think it's a result of umbilical cord removal.\n\nHere's where the interesting stuff comes up. I was abandoned as an infant in China during the one-child policy. I have all the reproductive parts and functions of a female (breasts, periods, reproductive parts), and I am apathetic to my own gender expression. Because of this gender apathy, one time when I mentioned the mystery scar to my friend, they sarcastically said \"maybe you were a hermaphrodite and your chinese parents cut your penis off so that you'd get adopted.\" that sounds ridiculous, and I know that intersex people don't simply have both sets of genitalia (at least not fully functioning), but honestly in my mind it's not an impossibility, and I can't help but wonder if I am actually intersex, but my bio family or whoever was there for my birth, to remove any irregular genitals so that I would have a better chance at getting adopted. \n\nThere is a rumour that floats around the Chinese-Adoption sphere that sometimes abandoned children would have a strange and unique scar so that if need be in the future, the bio parents could identify their child. I've heard a lot of mixed things about the reality of this, but it is true that when I was adopted, I had a scar on my leg that looked like a messy burn scar from a metal brand. It stayed visible on me for the first 12 years of my life before eventually fading. In China, the orphanages usually house children with disabilities or birth defects more than any other demographic because \"normal\" babies are sent out for adoption (like what happened to me).\n\nMy current family doctor's earliest records of me are from when I started the immigration process, so the first year of my life has no medical record of what could have been done. It is also possible that my actual date of birth is incorrect since the orphanage assigned a predicted date when finding me abandoned. \n\nIn blood tests, I have the following irregularities:\n\n* elevated RBC\n* below average MCV\n* elevated triglycerides\n* extremely low ferritin\n\nMy doctor has diagnosed me with thalassemia, and other than that, I have no other official diagnosis or treatments. Is it actually possible that I was born interssex? If not, what could this scar be from?",

Jesus Christ this is horrible and I really need some medical advice\nSo I (22F) was fine and normal until a couple days ago\u2026.I live in New York and a couple days ago, the air quality increased badly. I did not know this until I was already outside. The humidity was terrible and I myself was wondering why the air felt so bad. When I came back inside, I started to feel loopy, winded, lightheaded and kinda felt sick as well. I even got a bad headache. This is not the first time it\u2019s happened. I seem to always have similar reactions whenever I\u2019m exposed to bad air quality. After freshening up and washing my face then relaxing for a bit, all symptoms seemed to subside. \n\nBut then the next morning, I had an extremely dry throat. This was a first and has never happened before. It wasn\u2019t a soar throat at first but it felt like sand paper, parched throat, like there\u2019s ashes in the bottom. Pretty much feels like there\u2019s some rough material that\u2019s stuck at the bottom of my throat. Each morning it got worse. Until it eventually felt like I had an actual soar throat. I was able to subside the feeling throughout the day with home remedies, throat spray, etc., but each morning it always comes back in FULL FORCE. This morning was the worst of all. I am now at the stage where I\u2019m constantly coughing and it\u2019s not really about the uncomfortable feeling of a soar throat anymore. I basically got no kind of sleep\u2026.at all. Not only is there an intense tickle in my throat or very frequent ones, but I am unable to basically relax my throat. It feels like my airways are closing in and every millisecond I\u2019m coughing. It feels like there\u2019s a lump of sand paper in my throat that\u2019s blocking my ability to breathe properly and as a result, I\u2019m coughing every minute, like my airways have been narrowed down to the max. \n\nAlongside this I\u2019ve been taking antibiotics prescribed by my GI doctor and its Metronidazole. I\u2019ve had an on/off chronic cough for a couple years now and it flares up the worst whenever I get sick. I will end up having an after cough up to 2 months after being sick. It is suspected that my chronic cough may be induced by gastrointestinal issues which is why I went to see a GI specialist a couple weeks back. The point of the antibiotics is just to remove any existing bacteria that may be in my stomach. \n\nIn this specific case though, I don\u2019t feel sick. I don\u2019t have a fever or any other common cold symptoms. I\u2019m just losing a lot of sleep over this BS. So I\u2019m not sure if me having this cough is a result of being sick from the air quality or something else.\n\nI\u2019m also a little afraid that it could be the way I\u2019m taking the antibiotics? I haven\u2019t taken antibiotics in years and forgot if there\u2019s any health consequences to not taking them the right way. Sometimes I miss some days I\u2019m supposed to take it but I try to make it up the minute I remember in the next couple of days. So when taking Metronidazole, there were some gaps in my consistency of taking it properly. And because my cough was getting so bad, my mom though giving me a shot of lime, honey and rum would kill it off because of the acidity. But I don\u2019t know if it was a bad idea to take a shot with alcohol in it since I\u2019m still taking the antibiotics.\n\nI really need some help on this, any clue as to what could be going on?",

I immediately told my wife to take the watermelon from me and she did. The seizing up did not go away and I felt like I needed to bend forward as if that would get it to stop spasming. I felt like I had the wind knocked out of me as it was hard to breath. I slowly got up and made my way to the passenger seat and was in a lot of pain. I have not been able to do much since getting home and can\u2019t get comfortable. Is this a thrown out upper back? A pulled muscle? Any opinions? I\u2019m 31 years old and 5\u20197\u201d",

She did have diabetes after the surgery but that has also resolved. Now, 3.5 years later, my mom is facing the prospect of a kidney transplant. Apparently the anti rejection drugs are very toxic and as such, her kidney function is severely compromised. She had 1 hospitalization in march 2022 for kidney failure (it was terrifying)which kept her in the hospital an entire month. \n\nIn the last 3 months she has lost 30 pounds and weighs 97lbs now, about 5\u20195. The stress levels for our family have been huge, so that is definitely playing a huge role. \n\n6 weeks ago she was told dialysis is imminent with kidney functioning levels at 18. \n\nShe met with her care team on Wednesday this week and they said her kidney function is up to 30 now and they aren\u2019t looking at dialysis on the same timeline. They were quite shocked at the recovery. \n\nShe\u2019s supposed to meet with a vascular surgeon anyways so they can assess her for a port, as they feel it is inevitable she will eventually need dialysis. \n\nMy mom is in discomfort all the time. Her headaches, the horrible leg cramps every night, bowel issues, all of it is so much to endure for 1 person, her medication is life sustaining but it\u2019s also slowly killing her. Her kidney issues make it difficult for her to eat because her diet is so restricted. I\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t want the kidney Transplant because life is already so difficult with transplanted lungs. I\u2019m hoping to be the one to donate a kidney if she will proceed. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1.  Is it unusual for her kidney function to go up and down so much? \n\n2. if the situation Becomes acute, can she get dialysis right away or will they try to do a transplant immediately? \n\n3. Will the kidney transplant be physically easier to recover from than the lung transplant? \n\nSorry if this post is scattered, things are very difficult right now. \n\nMy mom is the centre of my world\u2026thank you very much for taking the time to read this.

Sometimes a decrease in WBC can be due to medication use (i.e antibiotics, antihistamines, autoimmune drugs, antacids), poor nutrition, vitamin deficiency, viral illness or anemia.

I have been under severe unexplained circumstances for like 4 years now. \n\n**A quick historical background**\n\nI have always had a troubled childhood. A madman for a father who was almost wrestling with us all, most of the time. He was so violent domestically that I used to pray for his death, not gonna lie. Abandoned us when I was like 15. On top of that, when my mother could have been my go-to person, she always found ways to further ridicule me, torture me, and made me question my existence. I have 2 sisters and 3 brothers apart from me and the thing is, genetically all of them are more like my mom (fair-complexioned), and only I am the one genetically close to my dad (brown-complexioned). \n\nMaybe she saw my dad in me. I used to scrub my skin for hours and hurt myself just because my mom thought I didn\u2019t look as fair as others. To keep it short, it was a disastrous upbringing. My elder brothers used to hit me so bad when I was at max 8-10 and I don\u2019t claim to be Jesus, but what wrong could a 10-year-old possibly do? My mom used to hit me whenever she got the chance. \n\nTo keep it short, I have spent the first 18-20 years of my life worrying about things, being anxious all the time, in fight or flight mode, and questioning how I looked. In no way was I a failure as a kid. I was totally obedient, more than I should have been, ideally. I was exceedingly good at academics and got distinctions all my studying years. I was really good at sports. I won declamation contests in my childhood in my region with all that was happening around me. The only point I am trying to make here is that I was a very good child checking almost all the boxes.\n\n**The albuterol incident**\n\nNow I was never bothered much by whatever was happening around me until one day I had this huge huge overdose of Albuterol when I was trying to treat my asthma but filled the whole nebulizer chamber with the drug instead of mixing it up. So it must have been a stupidly high dose ranging up to 20 mg and that is a killer dose. Ideally, all the side effects should have vanished in around 5-6 hours. The effects included severe severe high BP, severe palpitations, severe heart pain, and vertigo and I felt like dying in short. \n\nHowever, the symptoms never actually went away. I started losing weight very quickly and went from 72 kg to 54 in a couple of months. Severe GERD came in, severe diarrhea, bloating, and a lot happening to my heart. I couldn\u2019t make sense of anything. I was having sleepless nights. Very rarely did I sleep those days. I started having blurry and kind of disturbed vision. \n\n**Situation now**\n\nTo this day, I have gone to several doctors including gastroentrologists and cardiologists and upon several visits nothing could be found out. \n\nThe cardiologists have cleared me on my ECGs, EKGs, cardiac ultrasound, CT angiography, 24-hour Holter monitor, Exercise Tolerance Test (though it said borderline positive for Ischemia). My blood sugar level tests, potassium level tests, thyroid level tests and even Renal Functions Tests have been examined but nothing was found.\n\nThe thing is, I have severe symptoms(which I will explain more later), which I seriously think are because of the Albuterol overdose becaue everything went downhill from there and I had nothing physically hurting me before that.   \n\nUpon my last visit to my cardiologist, he aslo consulted another general physician and they both told me that I was dealing with FIBROMYALGIA and that Albuterol event only played a trigger for everything that came in afterwards. \n\nI will start mentioning whatever symptoms I have and you people please help me find out if I really have it or not.\n\nFatigue: I have severe fatigue syndrome. I do not remember the last time I felt fresh. Probably 4 years ago. I am almost always severely drained out. I do not feel like doing things I once enjoyed. Not just I don\u2019t feel like doing them, I have zero energy to do them. It feels like I do not have an ounce of will to do things.\n\nHigh BP: My BP has been recorded touching 160/90 at multiple occurrences on different doctor\u2019s visits. Maybe some of it is due to the anxiety I have while visiting a doctor. But I know it for a fact that I am dealing with high BP. I have constant pressure in my head and sometime it feels like I will fall down due to eqarthquake-y feeling as BP seems to be touching high numbers.\n\nConstant headaches: Now the headaches might be due to high BP obviously but I have these constant headaches. Like something has been placed on my head for so so long.\n\nStiff muscles: My body always feels like its is imploding inwards. Everything feels so tight and not in rest. Like generally, it feels like tightening up. \n\nGeneral body pain: Apart from fatigue and everything, my body really hurts all over. I can never point out where the pain is but it just hurts. Especially my limbs (thighs even more)  hurt a lot. \n\nUnexplained dry, hardened and tingling lips: I drink a lot of water during the day but after the Albuterol incident, my lips are always dry and hard.\n\nSevere loss of libido: Before the incident, I did have a very high libido. Now I have zero. I'm not proud of it but it was very hard to control my libido and I've fapped 3, 4 times a day. But after the overdose, I hardly feel like doing it. Been months I felt the need to, tbh.\n\nNeedling in my limbs whenever I sit on ground for long: Whenever I rest my limbs under some pressure for some time, they start needling. Sometimes it's so bad that i can't stand. It's like my legs will sometimes go on a sleep and I won't be able to stand.\n\nChest pain and all cardiac symptoms: My chest at the left side hurts a lot. I have severe palpitations that I can feel all over my body. Like I can feel my heart in my legs and stomach. BP soares to unbearable numbers. \n\nGERD and stomach problems: The GERD was very bad a couple years ago and not that bad now. But I normally feel indigestion and never have a very good feeling after I eat.\n\nEarthquake-y feeling: My hunch is I feel it when I have BP rising high but whatever it is, it is horrifying. I feel vertigo and an earthquake-y feeling for several minutes multiple times a day. \n\nWeight loss: Although I have a good weight of around 67kgs (I am 5 feet 7) but I feel like losing my weight. I feel so weak at times that it seems like I am underweight by a margin. \n\nI have been dealing with all this shit for 4 years now and I have multiple times thought about ending it up once and for all. However, I somehow kept going I have no idea why. Please help me out a bit.",

I'm not sure whether this is related to my tension headaches, but the ear fullness I feel when doing this is the same as the symptom I outline.\n\n**Important Notes**\n\n1. I have very little stress. I really manage stress well. Beyond stress *caused by* this, it's not stress. I am retired. I have a great life. I meditate and exercise. No mental health issues. \n\n**My theories**\n\n1. TMJ\n   1. I don't *currently* clench my teeth while sleeping or awake. However, this did begin 3 months after a stressful period where I was clenching a lot. I wonder if this messed up a disc.\n      1. My bite jerks to one side at a certain point during mouth opening, which it didn't used to. **However, a TMJ specialist (regarded as one of the best in NYC and referred to me by my orthodontist, who thought my disc could be messed up) believed that this could not be caused by my disc.** \n      2. I do not have pain or visible TMJ issues on CT scan, so according to specialist, this is unlikely.\n2. UARS/OSA \n   1. I'm getting a CPAP machine to try because I'm desperate. But I don't think that it will help me very much. I don't really suffer from any fatigue. But who knows.\n   2. This was put forth as the main theory by the TMJ specialist after seeing my sleep study\n\n**My questions**\n\n1. Could I have a disc issue based on the above? I don't have pain in either TMJ at all, and the CT was normal, but I'm not sure this jerking motion is as \"normal\" as it was made out to be by the specialist. **Should I push for an MRI of that disc?**\n2. If this is related to UARS/OSA, **does that explain the chronic ear fullness?** This is a very distinct symptom that started exactly at the same time\n3. What else am I not thinking of? Is it really true that these headaches can just randomly appear and my best hope is trying random stuff?",

I went back to my primary care and diagnosed me with BV and PID following the IUD placement. I was carefully screened for STDs before placement and refrained from sex before the procedure. My infection was a result of my insertion procedure. I am extremely concerned about fertility issues in the future. I have done my own research from medical journals and found the data for infertility is found in populations with STD bacteria caused PID. Since the complication is rather rare, I\u2019m worried there is not enough data to really be sure if I will have fertility concerns in the future.

I was sleeping in my mom's bed- she never actually slept in it but rather on the couch in our living room. I was by myself in the room and she came to wake me up on a school morning to get up and I told her I couldn't get up. She was, of course, doubtful, and told me to get up again, and I reiterated I literally couldn't get up. My legs could not move, and if I tried to force stimulation to get my legs to move I'd have immense pain in my thighs that felt like I had the weight of a Boeing 747 on me. My upper body was fine and I felt no pain up top. I was taken to the hospital and they ran a bunch of blood tests on me- nothing. They found literally nothing wrong and I went home. By 1pm that day I could walk just fine. No problems. \n\nHere's my question- what happened to me?

Did I have a penis removed at birth?\nPrimary Concern: I have an unknown scar, and am paranoid if it is from a surgery shortly after my birth.\n\nAge: 18  \nSex: Female (?)  \nheight: 166cm (\\~5'6'')  \nweight: 48kg (106lbs)  \nrace: chinese\n\nI have a vertical scar that is a perfectly straight line from right below my bellybutton to my vaginal area (as far as I can tell). I think it would be classified as normotrophic? The scar's not raised or textured, but noticably darker and looks similar to when I get minor wounds and after they've completely closed up, but are still visible as temporary scars (lasting maybe a few months). \n\nI have had this scar for my whole life, have never had a surgery relating to anywhere on my torso or reproductive parts, and never sustained severe injuries in this region. My bellybutton has no irregular scarring or shaping, so I don't think it's a result of umbilical cord removal.\n\nHere's where the interesting stuff comes up. I was abandoned as an infant in China during the one-child policy. I have all the reproductive parts and functions of a female (breasts, periods, reproductive parts), and I am apathetic to my own gender expression. Because of this gender apathy, one time when I mentioned the mystery scar to my friend, they sarcastically said \"maybe you were a hermaphrodite and your chinese parents cut your penis off so that you'd get adopted.\" that sounds ridiculous, and I know that intersex people don't simply have both sets of genitalia (at least not fully functioning), but honestly in my mind it's not an impossibility, and I can't help but wonder if I am actually intersex, but my bio family or whoever was there for my birth, to remove any irregular genitals so that I would have a better chance at getting adopted. \n\nThere is a rumour that floats around the Chinese-Adoption sphere that sometimes abandoned children would have a strange and unique scar so that if need be in the future, the bio parents could identify their child. I've heard a lot of mixed things about the reality of this, but it is true that when I was adopted, I had a scar on my leg that looked like a messy burn scar from a metal brand. It stayed visible on me for the first 12 years of my life before eventually fading. In China, the orphanages usually house children with disabilities or birth defects more than any other demographic because \"normal\" babies are sent out for adoption (like what happened to me).\n\nMy current family doctor's earliest records of me are from when I started the immigration process, so the first year of my life has no medical record of what could have been done. It is also possible that my actual date of birth is incorrect since the orphanage assigned a predicted date when finding me abandoned. \n\nIn blood tests, I have the following irregularities:\n\n* elevated RBC\n* below average MCV\n* elevated triglycerides\n* extremely low ferritin\n\nMy doctor has diagnosed me with thalassemia, and other than that, I have no other official diagnosis or treatments. Is it actually possible that I was born interssex? If not, what could this scar be from?",

Turns out that all of my issues I had during pregnancy, the cause of my son\u2019s stillbirth, and my chest pain and dizziness were all a result of Rheumatic Heart Disease.\n\nI ended up having a stroke and I thought that would change my urgency of care, but still I was dismissed by all of my providers. My cardiologist was very condescending and said my issues, specifically worsening issues, such as extreme chest pain, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, feeling a cold fluid feeling in my chest, my swollen abdomen and feet, and a hard cough, were just the result of stress and anxiety. I asked for an updated echocardiogram since I had one last year and much has change with my symptoms. I was denied and said an echo was absolutely not needed in my case. \n\nI went to my primary care who was also condescending and said it was anxiety. At the point of anger and tears I told her I felt like I\u2019m dying and I needed help. She said she was not a cardiologist but if it would help me feel better she would order an echocardiogram at the local hospital. \n\nMonday I had the echo. Wednesday I was diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease affecting both the mitral and tricuspid valves. There is still no urgency from my care team. I\u2019m being ignored by my PCP. My cardiologist gave a half-hearted \u201cwe\u2019ll request the echo records\u201d when I called them. I feel even worse. My chest pain now only ends when I feel a burst of fluid that feels like it fills my chest and neck. I\u2019m having trouble breathing all the time. But if I have a feeling if I traveled to the ER again, I\u2019d be dismissed right away just like I was before in pregnancy and earlier postpartum. I\u2019ve had this chest pain for months and especially when I was pregnant but for all the 6 times I went to Labor and Delivery I was discharged right away and never given an EKG or any cardiac work up. Same with my OB. \n\nSeparately, I\u2019m seeing a neurologist for my TIA. He\u2019s found something doing an EEG and multiple MRIs. He won\u2019t tell me the results until my follow up on 2 weeks but told me I absolutely cannot work or drive. \n\nI\u2019m truly at a loss of what to do. If I call the office I get attitude from both the nurses and receptionists. I can\u2019t even find good information on this disease because it seems like it\u2019s not common in developed countries. I live in the US, I\u2019m upper-middle class, I have always taken my full course of antibiotics when I\u2019ve had strep.

I treated my chronic back pain mostly with chiropractor and acupuncture, guided hypnosis sleep meditation...

After 24hrs induced and on magnesium I kept telling the nurses and Drs that magnesium was making me very sick, they kept saying it was normal and blaming preeclampsia, and it wasn't until I could barely speak and kept checking myself for stroke signs that they finally listened to me and cut the dose in half, I think it was 2mg to 1 mg but I don't know for sure, but it water being on it for 24 hours before dose was cut in half.

Immediately after birth I had a flash pulmonary adema, then had a latent post partem hemorrhage at about 13hrs PP once they got my breathing stabilized.\n\nWhat would cause me to have such bad magnesium toxicity and would magnesium toxicity cause a flash pulmonary adema?

I went to the dentist and all they did was give my teeth a clean. This actually helped with the sensitivity. However, over the next two years, I recognized that every time I would wake up in the morning, my mouth was very sour still. During this same time, my mouth would also become quite sour immediately after eating (I'm talking minutes or sometimes seconds after even just eating a snack). \n\n  \nThe most alarming aspect of all of this though, was how I noticed that my teeth were seemingly eroding away: my canine teeth and premolars especially were getting increasingly shaper in angle (look more like a shark with how pointy they have become). Additionally, the spaces between my teeth are now much larger: before this period, it was slightly difficult to fit my dental floss between each tooth but now there is so much space so that there is no difficulty in fitting the floss between each tooth, highlighting the wear. \n\n  \nWith all this in mind, I was confident that I had acid reflux/GERD/GORD. I went to my dentist who was unsure if this actually was acid reflux but was more confident in this being bruxism (grinding). They made a night guard and told me to see if it gets worse. My erosion did get more noticeable and the sour taste was still there. \n\n  \nThus, I went to see a gastroenterologist who, over the course of a year, carried out a 24 hour pH test and then a 48 hour BRAVO pH test to see if I really did have acid reflux. These two tests showed that I likely did not have acid reflux. However, before these two tests, the gastroenterologist prescribed me with omeprazole (20mg, which didn't work for long before upping this up to 40mg). I have been on this 40mg dose ever since (just before bed as I normally wake up with a very sour taste and I have noticed that my teeth wear away the most over night), despite these negative GERD indications.\n\n  \nI also then went to see an oral specialist and told her my experience about how eating a Gaviscon antacid tablet is helpful in getting rid of the sour taste that I experience immediately after eating. They said if the Gaviscon helps, it probably is a stomach issue and that she cannot help with that. She then sent me to do some bloods which returned all normal except very low zinc levels, but I'm not sure if that's related.\n\n  \nNow, I am extremely anxious and confused about what I should do. I do think I have acid reflux because besides from the symptoms i've mentioned beforehand, the back of my throat does also feel more sensitive and irritable, especially with spicy food. There is no question that my teeth are not in good shape, and definitely not like how they were before this whole period of experiencing sourness began. \n\n  \nPlease, can someone give me a possible explanation for what has been happening and what I can do about this?  \n",

[26M]\n**Me**\n\n26 M white male, no other health issues, nonsmoker, nondrinker\n\n**Symptoms**  \n1. Constant tension headaches for 8 months which feel like pressure around my ears, my forehead, and my temple region. Little if any pain, but lots of tightness that is severely uncomfortable.\n\n2. Ear fullness that I can \"pop\" away but consistently returns  \n**What I've tried**\n\nIt's unclear what the cause is, which is infuriating. Here are the things that I've tried.\n\n1. Prednisone \u2014 Helped a lot, but told I can't stay on it\n2. Botox - Also very helpful, but of course is a \"bandaid\"\n3.

CT Scan of TMJ joints \u2014 Normal\n4. Sleep Test: AHI of 5.6, RDI of 20.0 (mild-moderate sleep apnea)\n   1. I'm quite skinny and I sleep on my stomach, so maybe more likely UARS?\n\n**What makes it worse**\n\n1. When I bite together, I feel a muscle around my ears being triggered and they instantly get more \"full\". I'm not sure whether this is related to my tension headaches, but the ear fullness I feel when doing this is the same as the symptom I outline.\n\n**Important Notes**\n\n1. I have very little stress. I really manage stress well. Beyond stress *caused by* this, it's not stress. I am retired. I have a great life. I meditate and exercise. No mental health issues. \n\n**My theories**\n\n1. TMJ\n   1. I don't *currently* clench my teeth while sleeping or awake. However, this did begin 3 months after a stressful period where I was clenching a lot. I wonder if this messed up a disc.\n      1. My bite jerks to one side at a certain point during mouth opening, which it didn't used to. **However, a TMJ specialist (regarded as one of the best in NYC and referred to me by my orthodontist, who thought my disc could be messed up) believed that this could not be caused by my disc.** \n      2. I do not have pain or visible TMJ issues on CT scan, so according to specialist, this is unlikely.\n2. UARS/OSA \n   1. I'm getting a CPAP machine to try because I'm desperate. But I don't think that it will help me very much. I don't really suffer from any fatigue. But who knows.\n   2. This was put forth as the main theory by the TMJ specialist after seeing my sleep study\n\n**My questions**\n\n1. Could I have a disc issue based on the above? I don't have pain in either TMJ at all, and the CT was normal, but I'm not sure this jerking motion is as \"normal\" as it was made out to be by the specialist. **Should I push for an MRI of that disc?**\n2. If this is related to UARS/OSA, **does that explain the chronic ear fullness?** This is a very distinct symptom that started exactly at the same time\n3. What else am I not thinking of? Is it really true that these headaches can just randomly appear and my best hope is trying random stuff?",

The same day, I went to urgent care where X-rays were taken, but no broken bones were found. It was concluded that it was just a sprain, although I was told to see an orthopedic doctor if the pain wasn't getting better after a week, as the x-ray could have missed a hairline fracture. I was given an air cast and sent home to do ice/elevation. My ankle was very swollen, but I was able to walk just fine and there was not any bruising. What concerns me though is the noise I heard when the injury happened. Upon falling, I both felt and heard a pop in my ankle which makes me wonder if I tore a ligament.\n\nNow, 6 days later, the swelling is still there but to a much lesser degree. The pain was gradually improving the following 2 days after the sprain but has remained the same after that point. In fact, it almost seems slightly more painful today and yesterday. My ankle also seems...loose? Not sure if that makes any sense, but it just doesn't feel right. It sounds gross, but it feels like my foot is ready to fall off of my leg or something lol. Just a very unstable feeling. \n\nA little over a year ago, I had a very similar injury. I stupidly did not rest properly though, and only went to the doctor after 2 months of my ankle still hurting. She sent me to physical therapy which I attended for another two months. I was then referred to an orthopedic doctor who did an MRI and found bone bruising, a grade 2 sprain, and a small fracture which I had been walking around on for almost 4 months at that point. It was the same ankle in both sprains, likely due to the instability created by the first injury.\n\nI want to be more proactive this time around, but I also don't want to unnecessarily see a doctor if the sprain is minor. At what point should I make an appointment with an orthopedic doctor?",

Turns out that all of my issues I had during pregnancy, the cause of my son\u2019s stillbirth, and my chest pain and dizziness were all a result of Rheumatic Heart Disease.\n\nI ended up having a stroke and I thought that would change my urgency of care, but still I was dismissed by all of my providers. My cardiologist was very condescending and said my issues, specifically worsening issues, such as extreme chest pain, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, feeling a cold fluid feeling in my chest, my swollen abdomen and feet, and a hard cough, were just the result of stress and anxiety. I asked for an updated echocardiogram since I had one last year and much has change with my symptoms. I was denied and said an echo was absolutely not needed in my case. \n\nI went to my primary care who was also condescending and said it was anxiety. At the point of anger and tears I told her I felt like I\u2019m dying and I needed help. She said she was not a cardiologist but if it would help me feel better she would order an echocardiogram at the local hospital. \n\nMonday I had the echo. Wednesday I was diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease affecting both the mitral and tricuspid valves. There is still no urgency from my care team. I\u2019m being ignored by my PCP. My cardiologist gave a half-hearted \u201cwe\u2019ll request the echo records\u201d when I called them. I feel even worse. My chest pain now only ends when I feel a burst of fluid that feels like it fills my chest and neck. I\u2019m having trouble breathing all the time. But if I have a feeling if I traveled to the ER again, I\u2019d be dismissed right away just like I was before in pregnancy and earlier postpartum. I\u2019ve had this chest pain for months and especially when I was pregnant but for all the 6 times I went to Labor and Delivery I was discharged right away and never given an EKG or any cardiac work up. Same with my OB. \n\nSeparately, I\u2019m seeing a neurologist for my TIA. He\u2019s found something doing an EEG and multiple MRIs. He won\u2019t tell me the results until my follow up on 2 weeks but told me I absolutely cannot work or drive. \n\nI\u2019m truly at a loss of what to do. If I call the office I get attitude from both the nurses and receptionists. I can\u2019t even find good information on this disease because it seems like it\u2019s not common in developed countries. I live in the US, I\u2019m upper-middle class, I have always taken my full course of antibiotics when I\u2019ve had strep.

I upped the dose from 40 mg to 80 mg daily a couple of months ago. \n\nAt the start of April, I came off hormonal birth control after years of using it. Then, at the start of June, I went on vacation and spent a day out in the hot sun, hiking and sweating. I noticed after that day that I had developed some acne in the dead center of my back, right below my rib cage and in the crease where my spine is. It seems to be pretty standard acne \u2014 no pus, blackheads, cysts, etc. However, it has yet to go away, about 6 or so weeks later. It seems less pronounced (smaller, less red) than when it first developed, but I\u2019m wondering if I should be doing something else to fix it. My hormones have seemed a bit wonky since coming off hormonal birth control, which is to be expected, so I\u2019ve broken out on my face and a bit on my shoulders as well (mostly just on the part that curves onto my upper outer bicep). \n\nShould I be worried or trying to do anything to fix this?

        "context": "Sinus pressure on palate after jaw surgery\nHi all,\n\nI am currently 32, male.  I am obese and take medications for blood pressure and anxiety.  I was born with an underbite and crossbite and so at approx. age 25 I started a two part orthognathic surgical process to correct this.  The first surgery, a SARPE (surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion) was uneventful, but the bone-borne palatal expander that was implanted in the roof of my mouth fractured a week after surgery (while being activated via the wrench provided) and was prematurely removed, while the doctors maintained the transverse width that I had achieved to that point and move forward with orthodontics in preparation for the second surgery.  The second surgery, a Le Fort I osteotomy, advanced the maxilla forward.  I then had several additional months of orthodontics.\n\nAfter the braces were removed it was clear that my crossbite remained, likely as a result of inadequate expansion of the maxilla because of the palatal expander failure.  I was recommended for a revision surgery which I had done in 2019.  The new surgeon removed the hardware (plates and screws) from the Le Fort I osteotomy and repeated the SARPE procedure from scratch.  \n\nAfter this repeat SARPE surgery, the upper right quadrant of teeth either shifted downward entirely or the teeth erupted downward and I suffered root resorption and gum recession on almost all right side maxillary as a result.  I also developed a burning sensation in the right side of the hard palate, and a sensation of fullness/inflation when I breathe through my nose.  If I perform a Valsalva maneuver and breathe into my nose I feel air pressure on almost all teeth on the right side of the maxilla (and not the left), and it feels as if something is \"inflating\" between my right-side hard palate/teeth and the floor of my right nostril.  Additionally, if I shift my mandible left to right it activates a sort of suction/popping that is both clearly audible but also felt in those same areas of the palate/nasal floor.  I do not believe this popping is coming from the jaw joints (TMJ).\n\nA recent CT scan at my periodontist showed fluid in the right maxillary sinus, but other than that my jaw surgeon (who did the revision) has offered no explanation, and neither has any orthodontist or the periodontist himself.  The periodontist has recommended seeing an ENT which I am doing next month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestions: \n\n1. Why did the right side of my maxilla/those teeth shift downward after the revision SARPE procedure?\n2. Why did the gums recede on those teeth at the same time as the downward shift?\n3. What is going on with the air pressure/popping/clicking in the palate/nasal floor?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy jaw surgeon has shrugged off my complaints and it has made me feel powerless over my own health.  Any advice is sincerely appreciated.",

More symptoms followed including,  blood (not much though) mucous, stabbing/aching pain in stomache. I did a abdominal x-ray, they said I had a big piece of stool stuck and I took laxative to help with it. I did a abdominal ultrasound, they said I was fine and perfectly healthy.

The constant tinnitus is in both ears, though the left ear is often louder and sometimes has an additional tone.\n\n**Details about the pulsatile tinnitus:** The tinnitus is usually constant, but becomes pulsatile when I:\n\n* **Bend over** \\- I'll get about 5 seconds of pulse-synchronous whooshing in both ears. It's not a low-pitched ultrasound noise, it's like my hissing tinnitus pulsing along to my heart (ssssSSSSsssSSSssSSSsssSSS)\n* **Stand up quickly** \\- Again, about 5 seconds of pulse-synchronous whooshing in both ears\n* **Turn my head all the way to the right** \\- Same, about 5 seconds of the whooshing\n\nIf I maintain the positions above, after the 5-ish seconds, the pulsing stops and the tinnitus hisses normally, non-pulsatile.\n\nOther times it is pulsatile is doing hard cardio **exercise**... this is when it pulses the most, I hear 3-5 seconds of whooshing (both ears) on every other exhale when my heart rate is raised and pumping hard. Otherwise, I feel GREAT when I exercise, my heart rate recovers quickly when I stop, no headaches or weakness, etc.\n\nSometimes, I hear the pulsing inside my tinnitus when I first wake up in the morning, or when I wake up from a vivid dream. This can sometimes take a little while to calm down and is sometimes louder in the left ear.\n\nThe constant tinnitus is extremely somatic. I can make it louder by turning my head to the right, bending my neck all the way back, pushing on my forehead, jutting my jaw out, etc. I can even 'fake' the exact sound it makes when it's actually pulse-synchronous by doing these movements... the sound is the same.\n\n**The weirdest thing:** during the times the tinnitus is pulsing, I can STOP the pulsing by closing my teeth together. I CANNOT stop the pulsing by pressing anywhere on my neck or throat (I know that's a common test for vascular PT) I also cannot make a recording of the pulsing, which tells me it is probably a subjective noise and not 'real'.\n\n**Duration of Complaint:** 2-3 years, I don't know exactly, but it's been going on for quite a long time.\n\n**Factors to Consider:** I have a history of going to air shows and concerts without ear protection. I also used to work wedding receptions. For the last several years I have been using AirPods on my 6-7 mile daily walks, and I definitely had the music up way too loud to hear over traffic/outside noise. I know this is why I have the constant tinnitus. What I don't understand is why it is sometimes pulsatile. I protect my hearing now.\n\n**Tests I have had:**\n\n* **Brain MRI, with and without contrast, with IAC protocol:** totally clear and 'normal'\n* **Blood tests:** not anemic, liver and kidney function fine, thyroid levels are normal. Vitamin levels were not tested.\n* **Blood Pressure:** runs low if anything, has never been elevated when measured\n* **Hearing Test:** All thresholds normal, symmetrical hearing, including some extended high frequencies tested\n* **LDL/Tympanometry:** Normal LDLs and normal pressures\n* **Vestibular tests:** found a slight unilateral hypofunction on the RIGHT side, which is my 'better' tinnitus ear.. test was done to diagnose 24/7 rocking dizziness for a few months post-COVID infection. I've since 'compensated' for this and no longer feel dizzy.\n* **Chest CTA/EKG/Echocardiogram:** These were done last month because of a bad septic pneumonia infection, not because of the pulsatile tinnitus, but everything was perfect so I'm including it here just to mention that there probably isn't a cardiac concern.\n* **Eye Exam:** included digital images of my optic nerves, no papilledema seen\n\nI never cared about the noise before until I started being anxious about it, but now it causes me a great deal of anxiety and I listen to it constantly. I feel like I can habituate to it again if I could remove the anxiety that something is really wrong, since Googling 'pulsatile tinnitus' leads you down some scary rabbit holes, which is why I started seeking a doctor to begin with.\n\nI've been seeing an ENT/Neurotologist specialist, who I thought would be the best person for this due to his hyper-specialty but he seems unconcerned about my specific symptoms? I had to push for even the standard contrast brain MRI. He thinks if my PT was anything super concerning it would only ever appear in one ear and would be a more constant 24/7 thing.\n\nI think all of you doctors on here are so generous with your time and expertise, and I'm hoping you can give me some basic advice... **with my specific symptoms should I just put this to rest, or should I be seeking more scans ( brain MRA or carotid ultrasound?) And how urgently should I be seeking this out?**\n\nI'm not really trying to hunt down a cause for the PT, but I DO want to make sure that there's nothing dangerous going on.\n\nI'm really, really struggling with the anxiety. It's led me to restart Prozac after saying, years ago, that I'd never go back on another SSRI.\n\n(edited to include eye exam info, fixed typos)",

So, when I was younger I had semi-frequent episodes of diarrhea, then in my late teens/early 20s I started frequently having to strain to have bowel movements but also getting intermittent diarrhea, then the diarrhea subsided aside from rare occasion and I progressed from just having to strain to have a bowel movement to having to rock back and forth/side to side, to sometimes having to insert my fingers in my rectum to digitally remove feces, to basically becoming dependent on digital removal and enemas to have a bowel movement by my mid-20s. \r  \n\r  \nI brought this up to my PCP who first suggested I try various OTC laxatives (which didn\u2019t really do much), then later referred me to a gastroenterologist who recommended fiber and put me on lactulose, which I tried for around a few months which either did nothing or a couple times gave me uncontrollable explosive diarrhea with no therapeutic range where I could just have a normal bowel movement. I finally got the GI doc to give me a colonoscopy which came back normal, so he told me to just continue with the fiber and laxatives which were already not helping, so I basically just gave up on getting professional help for a while.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m now almost 35 and trying to take my health more seriously, and as a registered nurse I know that what I\u2019m experiencing is not normal and needs further evaluation. I go on bouts (I know I should be more consistent but struggle due to the untreated ADHD, also on the waitlist for a behavioral health provider) of taking fiber, magnesium citrate, and pre-/pro-biotics which are helping some, and I\u2019m basically to the point where I can sometimes initiate a BM naturally (especially if I wait longer than usual/comfortable once I\u2019ve had the sensation that I need to go) but still not go completely without digital stool removal or using an enema for the rest.\r  \n\r  \nOther relevant information:\r  \n\\-My stool is usually medium-brown in color, soft-formed or mushy, rarely hard/pebbly, I often express clear mucus from my rectum with or without stool, occasionally thick whitish stringy material in stool itself, and I\u2019ve noticed that some of the time when I have a BM without assistance it is very narrow (around finger-width) and sort of flat as if my internal anal sphincter doesn\u2019t like to fully/easily open (often feels like this when I insert fingers as well).\r  \n\\-I often have BLQ abdominal tenderness to palpation.\r  \n\\-I do get rare shooting pain from my anus to my penis; only happened a handful of times or so and seems random/unrelated to bowel movements or assisted stool removal.\r  \n\\-I have a small nodule (maybe pen-tip size if that) in my posterior rectum about 1 inch in (appeared \\~1.5 years ago, is small, soft, and has not grown in size; assessed by a family practice doc who gave me a referral to infectious disease despite all my STI tests coming back negative, that office said I should get a referral to a colo-rectal specialist, so I told the ordering doc and he just never got back to me). I assume it\u2019s from all the mild trauma initiated by digital insertion, enemas, and occasional anal sexual activity (see below) but don\u2019t know for sure.\r  \n\\-I do \u201cbottom\u201d and use anal sex toys a few times a year and have done so since my early teens, but I frequently avoid such activities due to my GI issues.\r  \n\r  \nSorry for the long-winded post, but I have a physical w/ my PCP next month and hope to have some suggestions of what to explore/tell her and maybe some advice of what I can do on my own to help. This has been a major and shameful struggle in my life for well over a decade now, and I just want it to go away. Thank you in advance!\r  \n",

The dentist ruled out a dental cause and suggested seeing an ENT.\n\nI had a scan done and the ENT said there was \u2018white\u2019 on the region of the scan and he didn\u2019t know what it was. So he referred me to another ENT department he thought could help.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t access his scan and to my recollection they ordered another one. They told me that they found an osteoma at the exact location of my pain, however they don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for an osteoma to cause facial pain. So they referred me to a pain clinic who said it was \u2018idiopathic facial pain\u2019 and probably neurological in origin. They said my best bet was seeing a \u2018pain psychologist\u2019 and taking nerve pain medication (which hasn\u2019t helped at all).\n\nI felt I wanted a second opinion on the osteoma and the pain, and finally got seen again by the ENT. They stated they couldn\u2019t access either of my scans, and had no record of the second scan and that it probably \u2018didn\u2019t happen\u2019 (it did). Nonetheless, he still was adamant that the osteoma couldn\u2019t cause facial pain and that pain psychology was the only treatment.\n\nNow, every study I have read states that sinus osteomas can and often do cause facial pain.\n\n\u2018The most common symptom of paranasal osteomas is pain including headache and facial pain (Atallah and Jay, 1981).\u2019 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319453411001044#:~:text=The%20clinical%20presentation%20of%20paranasal,Atallah%20and%20Jay%2C%201981).\n\nIt seems bizarre to me that there would be an osteoma at the exact location of the pain that\u2019s unrelated. What\u2019s even more bizarre to me is being told it can\u2019t cause facial pain when every study says it does.\n\nNow I\u2019m not certain this is the cause of the pain. However it confused me. Furthermore, I am not happy with the idiopathic/nerve diagnosis. They arrived at that from simply not finding another cause, and it really doesn\u2019t feel like a nerve problem to me (it feels very structural/physical, largely affected by pressure, I can feel/hear liquid/fluid opening closing etc).\n\nThey have stated they are going to try and locate the past scan, however that was from 4 years ago. I will pursue a new scan, but i am not convinced of whether the response will be any better.\n\nAny thoughts or advice would be useful!\n\nThanks",

Though I'm looking to get some information to help deal over the weekend.\n\nI say I'm constipated, but I still poop everyday.  Though starting on Wednesday  I was not getting complete evacuation.  I would poop an ok looking log, but it felt more was in there that did not want to come out.\n\nWednesday night I could feel bloating and that poop was backing up.  This happened again Thursday with my morning poop not getting everything to come out.\n\nI have been eating healthy, exercising, and loss a bunch of weight this year.  I cut out all Alcohol, candy, soda, junk food, milk, ice cream, and really revamped my whole diet to be healthy.  I don't smoke, do drugs, or on any kind of medication.   I try to keep good gut health drinking kombucha for the probiotics and all that stuff.\n\nRecently in the last few weeks I've been concentrating on eating more fiber to bulk up my poops a little bit more as I felt they were a touch loose.  I may have over did it as this may have caused my constipation as I was not drinking enough liquids to offset the increase in fiber.\n\nA side effect of this constipation seems to be the need to pee often, though when I pee not a lot comes out.  This usually happens at night after dinner and gets worst while I'm trying to sleep.  It's to the point that I'm try to pee, I feel like I'm done, go back to bed and 5 minutes later I have the I need to pee feeling again.\n\nSo I was talking with a friend yesterday about my constipation and they said a salt cleanse helped them in the past to get things moving.  So I read up on that yesterday and it seemed simple enough to try.  I did it first thing this morning and boy did lots of poop and sludge come out.\n\nI probably pooped water on and off for 30 minutes. At the end the water was pretty clear so I felt like it did it's job.  I did instantly feel better the rest of the morning.  I ate a egg and avocado sandwich for lunch, 5 hours after pooping water, to keep things light and have drank lots of water and a Kombucha today to rehydrate for all that lost water.\n\nOne thing in particular is the need to pee often with not much coming out has not gone away. I have had that pretty much all afternoon and still have it now as I type this post.  I'm been doing some Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles the last hour and that seem to have help things a bit.\n\nI still feel like I have to pee, but it's more an annoying feeling of something in the chamber then I have to pee right now.  I'm not sure if this matter, but it's a data point.\n\nSo now one thing I did Tuesday night, that may be important, was have some bedroom fun with my girlfriend.  So now I enjoy edging and she loves taking the dominate role at times.  So on this night we went at it where she basically controlled when and how I would cum.\n\nWe got to a point where I was rock hard riding the edge as she was stroking me.  At one point I felt the urge to pee and I said I have to pee.  She played her dominate role and say no peeing.\n\nHonestly I kind of liked it. The urge to pee while riding the edge, felt great.  So I went with it and didn't use our safe word to stop.\n\nIf anything I felt even harder having to pee and riding the edge.  My girlfriend was loving it, even commenting how much harder I was than normal.  This lasted for at least 45 minutes before I ejaculated and my penis had this vibrating feeling that was out of this world.\n\nAt that point I still had to great urge to pee but I was rock hard from all of the stimulation.  This made peeing pretty difficult, but I pushed it out.  I will say pushing out the pee was not smooth in the sense that t was kind of stop and start peeing.   In hindsight this may have not been the best move.\n\nThough I noticed \\~15 minutes later when I was completely soft that I felt like I had to pee again.  I went and only a dribble came out.\n\nI tell you all this because that urge to pee feeling I get now, feels pretty much the same as that urge to pee after 15 minutes I just mentioned.  If I do pee more the a dribble then it's has this stop and stop feel to it as well when I try to relax the muscle holding the pee back.  I don't know if they are related or just coincidence, but I felt it was worth a note.\n\nAnyways if anybody has some advice fore getting through the weekend that would be great.  I have no idea what tomorrow will bring and if all my issues will just go away with a night of sleet, but I'm looking for an opinion / some advice.\n\nMy doctor's office did not think this was an emergency, so I should not have much to worry about, but this urge to pee is pretty annoying.   It's been a little over an hour since I last peed as the Kegel exercises I talked about above seem to setting things down.  It's more of a tingle now then an all out I have to pee.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions and I apologize for any bad grammar or spelling.  Thanks for any help.\n\n&#x200B;",

I really manage stress well. Beyond stress *caused by* this, it's not stress. I am retired. I have a great life. I meditate and exercise. No mental health issues. \n\n**My theories**\n\n1. TMJ\n   1. I don't *currently* clench my teeth while sleeping or awake. However, this did begin 3 months after a stressful period where I was clenching a lot. I wonder if this messed up a disc.\n      1. My bite jerks to one side at a certain point during mouth opening, which it didn't used to. **However, a TMJ specialist (regarded as one of the best in NYC and referred to me by my orthodontist, who thought my disc could be messed up) believed that this could not be caused by my disc.** \n      2. I do not have pain or visible TMJ issues on CT scan, so according to specialist, this is unlikely.\n2. UARS/OSA \n   1. I'm getting a CPAP machine to try because I'm desperate. But I don't think that it will help me very much. I don't really suffer from any fatigue. But who knows.\n   2. This was put forth as the main theory by the TMJ specialist after seeing my sleep study\n\n**My questions**\n\n1. Could I have a disc issue based on the above? I don't have pain in either TMJ at all, and the CT was normal, but I'm not sure this jerking motion is as \"normal\" as it was made out to be by the specialist. **Should I push for an MRI of that disc?**\n2. If this is related to UARS/OSA, **does that explain the chronic ear fullness?** This is a very distinct symptom that started exactly at the same time\n3. What else am I not thinking of?

Go to the gym 5-6 times a week, diet well, stay clean (shower daily, wash face twice daily etc), I walk a lot cause I live in a walkable town and have a big dog so I\u2019m usually hitting 10k plus steps. Still play sports casually but used to be competitive until like 3 years ago.\n\nI do drink probably 2-3 times a week and smoke weed and vape. Occasionally I use mdma and lsd like maybe 2-3 times a year. I also used to be addicted to pills but now I\u2019m almost 3 years clean. My issues don\u2019t poke around using drugs and were actually less prevelant when I was addicted to drugs but I think that\u2019s just due to less anxiety and obviously not a worthy trade off\n\n\nSo basically about 5-6 years ago is started where my face, specifically my eyes and lips would swell up. Similar to a black eye or busted lip without the black or busted part. I would also get hives on my body that would potentially get huge and come and go seemingly randomly. Went to multiple different doctors including primary care, allergist, dermatologist, and then another allergist before I was finally diagnosed with chronic idiopathic uriticaria and angiodema. It\u2019s low key a fake diagnosis where chronic means it is recurring, idiopathic means they don\u2019t know what causes it, angiodema and urticaria means hives and swelling so basically just the scientific term for exactly what I know before going in.\n\nI have tried everything from food diaries, tracking daily activities such as drinking and excersize and locations I went to. I even spent a week eating plain rice and chicken with just salt and pepper only and not drinking anything aside from water.\n\nNow something a little different. Like 8-10 years ago I got scuba diving certified. On my first dive even tho I pressurized properly, it felt like the area under my eye next to my nose was about to explode. Quickly finished the test and went back up safely. I\u2019ve always been a really good swimmer getting top positions in state and such. After this when I dive down even 10 feet it starts to hurt if I don\u2019t pressurize. They guessed I had an air pocket in my sinus that didn\u2019t allow it to pressurize properly.\n\nYesterday I was somewhere cool in the ocean and was diving down about 10-15 feet probably about 10 total times and pressurized on the way down and up every time. Occasionally felt it a little but overall didn\u2019t hurt too bad. Now today I wake up and my face is a little swollen\u2019 lt is swollen below my eye across from my nose similar to where it hurts and not where it normally swells. This is only the second time it has swollen here and I don\u2019t really remember if anything caused it the first time\n\nWhat I\u2019m wondering is could these possibly be related? Do you guys know anything else about this condition or how to stop it? I want to stop taking Zyrtec every day but when I did stop for like a month my hives and swelling started flaring up. Is there anything I can do? When I\u2019ve looked at the potential causes/triggers it says shit like being hot being cold too much excersize not enough excersize etc",

        "context": "Periodic inguinal lymph node swelling during pregnancy\nI\u2019m a 32F, generally very healthy, currently am 11 weeks 5 days pregnant with my first child.\n\nSo this actually started about a month before getting pregnant, so this past April. It was my first cycle off of my BC (Annovera) as we intended to start TTC for the first time the next month. I had a lot of fullness and and pain in my lower abdomen, like a combination of period pain and the type of pain from having a very full bladder, going on for about a week. I was also urinating very frequently. I was getting to the point of thinking I should make a doctors appointment (I recently moved and don\u2019t have PC doc in my area yet, which is why I didn\u2019t go sooner).  My thought was possibly I had a UTI, although it didn\u2019t particularly burn when peeing or anything like that.\n\nSo after about a week of this I was out shopping when I randomly went to rub the area that was hurting, and I felt a pretty prominent lump in my left groin area that definitely wasn\u2019t there before. Shortly after I got light headed and started to loose vision, and I had to sit down in the middle of the store (though I didn\u2019t totally loose consciousness). I believe that this was a vagal response (I\u2019ve had them before) probably to freaking myself out by feeling the lump and not passing out directly related to my condition, but obviously I can\u2019t be sure. \n\nSo I recovered from that spell and when I examined the lump some more at home, it seemed pretty obvious it was an inflamed inguinal lymph node. It was moveable and tender. The pain was pretty bad that night and the lymph node still swollen in the AM, so I went to urgent care. The doc there agreed I was feeling a lymph node and that it didn\u2019t seem particularly suspicious for anything like cancer, she examined me to look for any cuts or rashes on my body that might be causing an immune response and found nothing, so agreed it could be a UTI. She sent me home with antibiotics and sent my urine to the lab. I took the antibiotics and by the end of the course the swelling was mostly gone. The urine test came back negative, but I figured since the antibiotics helped it was likely some sort of infection somewhere causing the swelling. I also got my period a few days after the swelling started and my pain resolved after that.\n\nFast forward about a month and I got my positive pregnancy test. I had some bloating and soreness in my lower abdomen that my doc said was typical for early pregnancy, and again had urinary frequency but again, typical for pregnancy. The pain was no where near as bad as the episode a month before. A few weeks after the positive test I noticed my lymph node had swollen again. I did have some bug bites on my leg though on the same side as the lymph node so thought maybe that triggered it this time? It lasted  for a few days before the node felt normal again. The pregnancy has been normal aside for some very light spotting during the 6th week, but my blood work and US came back normal and right on track for where I am in pregnancy. \n\nHowever I am still concerned bc after the bug bites totally cleared, I noticed my lymph node still periodically became swollen and tender, with no apparent cause. It will only last for a day to a few days, then go down, sometimes going from very swollen completely normal overnight. I have noticed that taking Tylenol helps the swelling go away quickly. I mentioned this to my OB after the first time it got swollen in pregnancy, and she said she had no idea what it could be, but if it came back she could refer me to have it examined with ultrasound. But when it came back next, it was gone before I even got a chance to speak with her.

Only meds was Tylenol and tramadol when pain was excruciating for my lower broken back and that was extremely sparingly, maybe once a week.  I treated my chronic back pain mostly with chiropractor and acupuncture, guided hypnosis sleep meditation...  Anything and everything I could do to keep off meds while pregnant.  \n\nI had Gestational Hypertension which just started to turn to Preeclampsia same day they induced me at 37 weeks (had run preeclampsia test 24 hours before and was fine). After 24hrs induced and on magnesium I kept telling the nurses and Drs that magnesium was making me very sick, they kept saying it was normal and blaming preeclampsia, and it wasn't until I could barely speak and kept checking myself for stroke signs that they finally listened to me and cut the dose in half, I think it was 2mg to 1 mg but I don't know for sure, but it water being on it for 24 hours before dose was cut in half. Started feeling better but still almost paralyzed heavy and blind from magnesium.  Another 24 hrs.later they were getting ready to do a C-section cause baby was getting D cells and stopped progressing at 8cm.  They ran my blood and I was 3X the level of Magnesium toxicity (I think it was 2.5 was high and I was almost at an 8, but don't quote me, I just remember the travel nurse saying \"wow you're 3X the level of toxicity\" or something like that and she gave me numbers), even after they cut my levels in half and 24 hours later.  I ended up being manually dilated, baby was twisted wrong way so they manually twisted her and I delivered vaginally.  Immediately after birth I had a flash pulmonary adema, then had a latent post partem hemorrhage at about 13hrs PP once they got my breathing stabilized.\n\nWhat would cause me to have such bad magnesium toxicity and would magnesium toxicity cause a flash pulmonary adema?  I believe the Pitosin caused my hemorrhage, but just odd so long PP.  I had hemorrhage before but only on deliveries that were induced.\n\nI want another baby so bad.  But having that much go wrong with that delivery terrifies me.  Is there something I can do ahead of time?  What would cause me to get magnesium toxicity?  Is there other options, other things I should do that my body wasn't processing the magnesium, or was this most likely a malpractice and someone was screwing up the doses?

I live in Southern California, I am a 5'7\" 140lb 27 Y/O Male who is very athletic. I eat clean, I exercise regularly, and take multivitamins. \n\nI was two months into the Sheriff academy when on the weekend of June 10th 2023 I got sick. Headache, nausea, chest congestion and an overall feeling of exhaustion. I've been sick before, so this wasn't alarming. I was coughing up yellow/green phlegm that following week, and was trying to dial it down but the intensity of the sheriff academy, my pride, and pushy instructors who don't \"allow you\" to be sick got the better of me, and I trained through it. Over the next few week I felt off but generally okay, all symptoms had subsided except I was coughing up green phlegm still, and I felt like I was operating at 70% capacity. I was still running 7-9 Miles at a 7 Minute flat pace, but I felt terrible doing it. At this time I was living in barracks housing, which was old, dirty, and there was mold present in some areas. \n\nFast forward a few weeks, I choose to remove myself from the academy for a variety of reasons, my wife and daughter needed me at home, my daughter is autistic and being away for weeks at a time was too hard on her, I was still sick, and ultimately I felt the job wasn't for me. Still coughing up green phlegm on Jun 26th I went to urgent care. The Physician I saw said I probably have bronchitis and prescribed the following:\n\ndoxycycline (MONODOX) 100 MG capsule (2 a day for 10 days)\r  \nalbuterol 108 (90 Base) MCG/ACT inhaler\r  \nmethylprednisolone (MEDROL DOSEPACK) 4 MG tablet (6-5-4-3-2-1 daily doses)\n\nI took 9 days worth of the antibiotic, but it was making me feel worse, and I skipped the last dose the 10th day. I took the steroid, as directed, with the exception of one day where I missed one of the four doses. \n\nAfter all that, I developed bad sinus pressure and nasal congestion, and the chest congestion was still present. I don't have the urge to cough, but when I exhale hard and deep, or \"Huff\" I can hear the crackling and can cough up the green mucus. Usually by the afternoon I feel halfway decent and most of my congestion has eased. But the next day I start all over again; plugged nose, green mucus, chest congestion, face pressure. I live at elevation and when I drive down the hill for work I get plugged up, ear pain, and sinus pressure. OTC stuff doesn't seem to help.\n\nI went back to the same urgent care on 7/14, the PA who saw me essentially told me to continue waiting it out, was very dismissive of me, and reluctantly ordered chest and sinus X-Rays of which I am still awaiting results.\n\nUltimately, as of today I am still sick, closing in on 40 days straight of CRAP! I have never been sick for this long in my entire life. Am I overthinking it? Do I just keep waiting? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nANY ADVICE IS GREATLY APPRECIATED, and I will promptly answer any questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks\n\n&#x200B;",

Sometimes a decrease in WBC can be due to medication use (i.e antibiotics, antihistamines, autoimmune drugs, antacids), poor nutrition, vitamin deficiency, viral illness or anemia. This level will typically return to normal, but in severely and persistently low WBC, this can be related to infection, autoimmune disorders, or malignancy, and warrants follow-up care.  \nPlease schedule a Health Services/Blood Draw Only visit in one month with us to draw blood and recheck your complete blood count and a blood smear. I want to make sure any abnormal levels do not persist or warrant further evaluation. In white blood cells remain low, other tests we may consider include vitamin B12/folate, copper, liver function, viral hepatitis, HIV, coagulation testing, inflammation markers, or even red blood cell Duffy antigen typing for Benign Ethnic Neutropenia.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nABSOLUTE NEUTROPHILS  \nNormal Range: 1500-7800  \n1383 cells/uL\n\n\\_\\_\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT  \nNormal Range: 3.8-10.8\n\n3.5 thousand/uL\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\n\n**2016**\n\nHowever, back in 2016 I had similar-ish results:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhite Blood Cell Count 4.1 (Range: 4.0 \u2010 11.0 K/uL)\n\nNeutrophil % 41 \ufd3eL\ufd3f (Range: 49.0 \u2010 74.0 %)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI never did anything with these, no one ever told me it mattered tbh. my bad.   \n\n\n\\_\\_\n\n**QUESTIONS/ASKS:**\n\nThe question is, what does this all mean?

But it really does provide relief.\r  \n\r  \nI've already seen every kind of doctor and sometimes got a 2nd opinion from another one so please suggest a test you think I should have or a condition I might have. I've already seen the type of doctor you are are going to suggest I swear. In fact Ive posted here a long time ago when I was having multiple types of headaches at the same time and it was basically impossible to help me because at least one was always going off and I'm terrible at figuring out what kind I'm having.\r  \n\r  \n**Progress:**\r  \nI'm happy to report quitting SSRI medications stopped the headaches SSRI sensitive people get (cyproheptadine helped but not enough and those side effects are rough).\r  \n\r  \nI have ASD and Klonopin stopped my overstimulation headaches.\r  \n\r  \nAdderall stopped my migraines.\r  \n\r  \nMeclizine is only \"helping\" my motion sickness headaches (maybe not enough) and its extremely tiring. Maybe I should go back to the Scopolamine patches 24/7.\r  \n\r  \n**Medications that did not help:**\r  \n\rPercocet\r  \n\r  \nTramadol\r  \n\r  \nFioricet\r  \n\r  \nNurtec\r  \n\r  \nQulipta\r  \n\r  \nAmlodipine\r  \n\r  \nTheophylline\r  \n\r  \nRizatriptan\r  \n\r  \nSumatriptan\r  \n\r  \nPepcid AC\r  \n\r  \nZyrtec\r  \n\r  \nMagnesium\r  \n\r  \nAdvil, Tylenol, Meloxicam, caffeine - didn't help but gave me rebound headaches\r  \n\r  \nTENS machine didn't help but maybe I should try it again. I was really trying to push it to the max I could tolerate but from what i've been reading (yea it hurts so bad I go back reading over the same old stuff hoping I find something I missed) thats really not the way to use it.\r  \n\r  \nEffexor - felt like a headache shift. If I had to guess I would say it helped my migraines but made the serotonin headaches worse (it was before adderall)\r  \n\r  \nmedial branch block c2:c3 - the procedure hurt insanely badly until the next day and they only injected a medicine that would numb occipital neuralgia for 2 hours **so I have no idea if it worked or not**. It seems like they should have anticipated I would be unable to articulate the different extreme pains so close to each other in the back of my head/neck.\r  \n\r  \n**A few more relevant notes:**\r  \n\r  \nI had a brain MRI, its fine. I had a neck MRI, they said I have some problems but they should not be bad enough to be causing any of my headaches:\r  \n\r  \nStraightening of cervical lordosis.\r  \n\r  \nMultilevel mild degenerative disc disease changes at C3-C7 with multilevel mild canal stenosis. There is no disc protrusion or cord compression.\r  \n\r  \nMild diffuse facet degenerative changes as described. I passed the caloric stimulation test but i do have tinnitus.\r  \n\r  \n**Trigger Point Injection day was frigging awesome**. For 2 hours I felt like a normal person. They said the fact that it was only 2 hours meant it failed. They said I had to be responding to the numbing medicine (Bupivacaine HCl (MARCAINE)) and not the real medicine they shot in there (triamcinolone acetonide (KENALOG-40)).\r  \n\r  \n**It looks like there are a lot of possibilities for what the remaining headache could be:**\r  \n\r  \nwhiplash damage - someone was driving a truck in the rain without windshield wipers and I was stopped at a red light. he hit me doing about 45 without trying to slow down at all because he couldnt see in the rain but that was 15 years ago and this has only been a problem for half that long\r  \n\r  \ncervicogenic headache - because its not a throbbing pain and the diagram showing pain from the top half the neck to the top of the head is perfect for me most of the time. But I went to physical therapy 8 times and a chiropractor 6 times.\r  \n\r  \nCraniocervical Instability - was suggested last time but the chiropractor would feel that right?\r  \n\r  \nchronic sub-occipital trigger point issues from bad posture - Another Aspie suggested this to me. Maybe we keep those flexed. I do lean my head forward an extreme amount. That is the area that hurts the most (when things are good and its not the whole back of my head this is actually the only area hurting).\r  \n\r  \nCFS leak - was suggested by the most people last time because of how much laying down for 30 minutes helps or how bad I feel shortly after getting out of bed in the morning. Laying down seems to help me considerably more than other people having a headache. However Theophylline didn't help so that seems to rule out CFS leak. I read CFS leaks cause \"postural headaches\" and you can can get postural headaches for other reasons than CFS leak. Perhaps I should be tested for those less common reasons.\r  \n\r  \nTension headache - But I think its tension headache even though the sides almost never hurt and I only have pain behind my forehead every once in a while. Adderall kills the migraines, makes the tension headaches worse, I take some tizanidine and the headaches go back to how they were before. Also, back before I had any issues resolved Propranolol helped me the most. And propranolol helps migraines and tension headaches. So if it was curing two different kinds of headaches that would definitely explain why it was the best (but it made me so tired I laid down more so that might be misleading me). I can't take Propranolol now. It completely nullifies the Adderall. I need a different muscle relaxer to test this further. Tizanidine ruins noradrenaline and makes me incredibly sleepy. I read there are muscle relaxers that don't change noradrenaline at all, don't significantly raise serotonin (if it raises serotonin more than Adderall's tiny bit I'd guess I can't tolerate it), and are less tiring than Tizanidine I just don't know if they are good for tension headaches.\r  \n\r  \nCould you suggest any tests or medications for me to request from my many doctors? Thank you",

        "context": "Stepped on a MAJORLY rusty nail two days ago. I just want to confirm that I don't need antibiotics.\nWhite Female \\* 38 y.o \\* 66  inches tall \\* 141 lbs \\* No daily medications, but I do carry an EpiPen for stinging insect allergy \\* I don't drink alcohol and haven't for 10 years ( I genuinely just hate the stuff...no history of problems with substance abuse) I don't smoke \\* NO drugs \\* No real medical history other than awful anaphylaxis to fire ant bite and then almost immediate raging cellulitis in that foot and ankle two days later. (May 2022.) \n\n\\* Stepped on Rusty nail in filthiest shoes possible. Photo link below.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/vjtk4e8\n\nI am a teacher and I also enjoy woodworking. I am building a 'Buddy Bench' for our elementary school playground, and we have also been DIY renovating our home this entire summer. I managed to step on an extremely rusty nail that had been outside for weeks. This happened two days ago (on Wednesday.) I was changing the bit on my trim router without gloves (brilliant, I know) and then I clipped the side of my hand and started to bleed. I leaned over to grab a paper towel, tripped, hit the side of my house, bounced off of the siding, ran into the deck railing, and then somehow flipped over my bin of scrap wood/trim and dumped it all over and then landed straight on top of a piece of shoe molding with nails sticking straight up. I jammed my foot down pretty hard/suddenly and the nail blew straight through the sole of my garden boots and punctured a little more than 1/4 inch into my foot. It was enough to cause pretty sharp pain and I did have very minor bleeding. \n\nI went straight upstairs to my bathroom and my husband, who is on peritoneal dialysis here at home, grabbed a ton of his supplies and I immediately: \n\n1.) Washed my hands, put on gloves, and then washed the puncture wound with Hibiclens for about 2-3 minutes (we used a piece of gauze for this.) I let it sit for another minute and then rinsed it off. \n\n2.) New gloves, and then I opened a pair of surgical tweezers from a package and used these to remove a chunk of the sole of my boot from the wound. \n\n3.) Washed the wound again with Hibiclens. \n\n4.) Soaked gauze in the debriding/antimicrobial liquid called 'Except' that he uses to clean his exit site for his PD catheter. I let this sit on my foot for the suggested two minutes. \n\n5.) I applied his Gentamicin ointment to my foot and then covered with a silver alginate dressing and then closed it up with one of his island bandages. I put a new, clean sock on it and then went to urgent care pronto because I believe my last Tetanus shot was in 2013...I just wasn't sure and didn't want to take any chances at all. \n\nI let the P.A at the Urgent Care have a look and he said it definitely got me, but it sounded like I did a solid job cleaning it up initially. He didn't see any more shoe bits inside and put a clean bandage on it for me and then definitely agreed that I needed a tetanus booster, so we got that done and I left. \n\nHe didn't believe I needed any preventative antibiotics at that time but did tell me that if I noticed any signs of infection, increased pain, drainage, fever, etc...to come back immediately. \n\nVaccines can obviously cause you to feel gross for a day or two, and I started feeling like absolute crap last night. Body aches, fatigue, and a very, very sore foot, calf, thigh, and hip. I figured this is from limping/overcompensating and my muscles just hurt. It hurts to ball my foot up or move it much. \n\nMy question is this: Does this sound normal for this situation and is not giving a prophylactic antibiotic the right choice for me? I think the wound looks pretty good, but I'm not a medical professional so I don't trust my own assessment LOL.  I've been keeping it super clean and covered. I'm just worried about possible infection. I don't want/mean to be paranoid, I just don't want to develop any complications. As mentioned above...my husband already has ongoing health problems. We have two young children AND I'm a new teacher that's about to start back to work in two weeks. I do NOT want or need any problems that could have been prevented.\n\nThe P.A was a great guy and I trust him for the most part, I just wanted to see what someone else has to say about it. In the grand scheme of things, this isn't a very severe nail puncture wound, but what bothers me most is the pair of boots I had on. They are absolutely filthy and I have cleaned loads of cat litter, black mold, toilets, garages, been to the landfill repeatedly, and the list goes on. The thought of a chunk of the sole of those nasty things going into my foot (along with a rusty nail) just gives me the creeps :/ \n\nAs long as the wound looks OK and I am up to date on my Tetanus shot, I should be fine to just watch and wait, right? Please ease my mind. \n\n&#x200B;",

        "context": "19F At a loss for what to do - colonoscopy and endoscopy results\nI've had stomach issues for years now since I was ten, which I long just assumed to be IBS, with no way to confirm this because as a kid my parents would not bring me to doctor. I struggled with constipation and feeling like I was never finished when I went to the bathroom. I had mucus in stool and on the rare occasion that I would get pain from constipation lasting too long,  I would have these brief fainting spells or just feel really dizzy.\n\nMoving forward to now I've been suffering from stomach pain since the start of this year in my lower abdomen around my belly button and pelvis- mainly situated in the center and left side, constantly going back and forth between constipation and diarrhea, with nothing subsiding the pain aside from eating which slightly lessened it until I hurt even worse at night. Between the pain and the fatigue it brought with it, I've been unable to carry on with my usual activities and mostly find myself lying in pain for most of the day. I first went to my PCP who sent out abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds, as well as blood tests testing for celiac, all of which came back normal.\n\nUpon following up with my GI doctor I did a colonoscopy, in which I was unable to properly do the prep as the solution made me nauseous and so some areas were not clear. He told me however that my results were normal aside from some small hemorrhoids. I later did a H. Pylori breath test, as my dad had gotten it around this time, which came back negative. I recently did an endoscopy where a biopsy was sent which was found to be normal aside from mild gastritis, which brings me here.\n\nAside from potentially repeating the colonoscopy or doing a CT scan- which terrifies me because of the radiation- I don't know where to turn next, and hate that there almost seems to be no root cause to my symptoms. Has anyone else experienced anything similar, or potentially know what condition this may sound similar to? Could it really just be IBS? I'm so exhausted.",

Did I have a penis removed at birth?\nPrimary Concern: I have an unknown scar, and am paranoid if it is from a surgery shortly after my birth.\n\nAge: 18  \nSex: Female (?)  \nheight: 166cm (\\~5'6'')  \nweight: 48kg (106lbs)  \nrace: chinese\n\nI have a vertical scar that is a perfectly straight line from right below my bellybutton to my vaginal area (as far as I can tell). I think it would be classified as normotrophic? The scar's not raised or textured, but noticably darker and looks similar to when I get minor wounds and after they've completely closed up, but are still visible as temporary scars (lasting maybe a few months). \n\nI have had this scar for my whole life, have never had a surgery relating to anywhere on my torso or reproductive parts, and never sustained severe injuries in this region. My bellybutton has no irregular scarring or shaping, so I don't think it's a result of umbilical cord removal.\n\nHere's where the interesting stuff comes up. I was abandoned as an infant in China during the one-child policy. I have all the reproductive parts and functions of a female (breasts, periods, reproductive parts), and I am apathetic to my own gender expression. Because of this gender apathy, one time when I mentioned the mystery scar to my friend, they sarcastically said \"maybe you were a hermaphrodite and your chinese parents cut your penis off so that you'd get adopted.\" that sounds ridiculous, and I know that intersex people don't simply have both sets of genitalia (at least not fully functioning), but honestly in my mind it's not an impossibility, and I can't help but wonder if I am actually intersex, but my bio family or whoever was there for my birth, to remove any irregular genitals so that I would have a better chance at getting adopted. \n\nThere is a rumour that floats around the Chinese-Adoption sphere that sometimes abandoned children would have a strange and unique scar so that if need be in the future, the bio parents could identify their child. I've heard a lot of mixed things about the reality of this, but it is true that when I was adopted, I had a scar on my leg that looked like a messy burn scar from a metal brand. It stayed visible on me for the first 12 years of my life before eventually fading. In China, the orphanages usually house children with disabilities or birth defects more than any other demographic because \"normal\" babies are sent out for adoption (like what happened to me).\n\nMy current family doctor's earliest records of me are from when I started the immigration process, so the first year of my life has no medical record of what could have been done. It is also possible that my actual date of birth is incorrect since the orphanage assigned a predicted date when finding me abandoned. \n\nIn blood tests, I have the following irregularities:\n\n* elevated RBC\n* below average MCV\n* elevated triglycerides\n* extremely low ferritin\n\nMy doctor has diagnosed me with thalassemia, and other than that, I have no other official diagnosis or treatments. Is it actually possible that I was born interssex? If not, what could this scar be from?",

I\u2019m looking into getting the laparoscopic surgery to see if I have it and if so, how far progressed it is for sake of my fertility. \n\nThe symptoms I\u2019m feeling happen pretty much every day and I\u2019ve had every test in the book and as far as my doctors are concerned I just need to lose weight and it\u2019s probably just my anxiety. My symptoms usually are a dizzy sensation, and this weird feeling like my body is vibrating on the inside. The dizzy sensation isn\u2019t quite dizziness and not quite vertigo, it just feels like when you\u2019re really congested and you move your head too fast and it feels like your vision and brain don\u2019t move with you. My ears have been hurting for a good few months now but theyre always fine. I thought I had an ear infection because I know that can cause pain and vertigo/balance issues, but I don\u2019t have one. It always feels like my ears need to pop but I can\u2019t pop them. \nThe vibrating sensation is almost an internal feeling. I\u2019m not shaking on the outside, but it feels like my insides are vibrating. I really don\u2019t know how to describe it. I think that could more so be anxiety, but I\u2019m not sure. \nI\u2019ve gone to chiropractors, I\u2019m getting a massage tomorrow to see if it\u2019s just my neck and shoulder tension, I\u2019ve been on meds for everything under the sun, but nothing works.

I noticed on the 4th that I hadn\u2019t really been going much. Since then, same thing. Small amounts, always hard and unproductive. Drank 10oz of magnesium citrate two days ago, went a good amount up until like 6 last night. It lasted about 24 hours, but a vast majority of my BMs were pretty much clear.

(1.5M)\nHello,\n\nMy son: 1 and a half year old male, 25lbs, 35 inches, white, no health issues other than constipation. \n\nI've posted before about my son's (1.5 year old) chronic constipation. My question is, how exactly does constipation happen in the bowels? If my son takes high enough doses of stool softeners and laxatives, he'll have one or two mushy poops per day. If he misses a dose or gets a smaller dose, the next day he will still poop, but it will be hard and small. The next day pebbles, and the day after that, he stops pooping altogether. When he gets back on the laxatives, he will go back and forth between pooping water and pooping pebbles until his stool gets back to normal consistency & frequency. \n\nHow could he go from soft wet poops to hard poops within a day? Wouldn't it need to be in his colon longer to get that hard? Does it mean that too much water is being pulled from his intestines? He doesn't seem dehydrated - he wets diapers well, has a wet mouth, cries tears, and drinks water all day long as well as milk bottles. He also eats lots of fiber. \n\nThank you! ",

        "context": "Unknown Medcial History. Did I have a penis removed at birth?\nPrimary Concern: I have an unknown scar, and am paranoid if it is from a surgery shortly after my birth.\n\nAge: 18  \nSex: Female (?)  \nheight: 166cm (\\~5'6'')  \nweight: 48kg (106lbs)  \nrace: chinese\n\nI have a vertical scar that is a perfectly straight line from right below my bellybutton to my vaginal area (as far as I can tell). I think it would be classified as normotrophic? The scar's not raised or textured, but noticably darker and looks similar to when I get minor wounds and after they've completely closed up, but are still visible as temporary scars (lasting maybe a few months). \n\nI have had this scar for my whole life, have never had a surgery relating to anywhere on my torso or reproductive parts, and never sustained severe injuries in this region. My bellybutton has no irregular scarring or shaping, so I don't think it's a result of umbilical cord removal.\n\nHere's where the interesting stuff comes up. I was abandoned as an infant in China during the one-child policy. I have all the reproductive parts and functions of a female (breasts, periods, reproductive parts), and I am apathetic to my own gender expression. Because of this gender apathy, one time when I mentioned the mystery scar to my friend, they sarcastically said \"maybe you were a hermaphrodite and your chinese parents cut your penis off so that you'd get adopted.\" that sounds ridiculous, and I know that intersex people don't simply have both sets of genitalia (at least not fully functioning), but honestly in my mind it's not an impossibility, and I can't help but wonder if I am actually intersex, but my bio family or whoever was there for my birth, to remove any irregular genitals so that I would have a better chance at getting adopted. \n\nThere is a rumour that floats around the Chinese-Adoption sphere that sometimes abandoned children would have a strange and unique scar so that if need be in the future, the bio parents could identify their child. I've heard a lot of mixed things about the reality of this, but it is true that when I was adopted, I had a scar on my leg that looked like a messy burn scar from a metal brand. It stayed visible on me for the first 12 years of my life before eventually fading. In China, the orphanages usually house children with disabilities or birth defects more than any other demographic because \"normal\" babies are sent out for adoption (like what happened to me).\n\nMy current family doctor's earliest records of me are from when I started the immigration process, so the first year of my life has no medical record of what could have been done. It is also possible that my actual date of birth is incorrect since the orphanage assigned a predicted date when finding me abandoned. \n\nIn blood tests, I have the following irregularities:\n\n* elevated RBC\n* below average MCV\n* elevated triglycerides\n* extremely low ferritin\n\nMy doctor has diagnosed me with thalassemia, and other than that, I have no other official diagnosis or treatments. Is it actually possible that I was born interssex? If not, what could this scar be from?",

It comes out of nowhere and lasts for 2-3 weeks non stop, then it will suddenly end and go back to normal. Then it will be normal for about 3 months and return again out of nowhere \n\nAt first I thought I was just imagining the smell and that only I could smell it, but my family can smell the cigarette smoke as well. When I asked them to smell my nose they could smell the cigarette smoke immediately \n\nI\u2019ve never smoked cigarettes, no one in my house smokes cigarettes. When I\u2019m outside, I can still smell it. When I travelled abroad last year, I had the same smell in the place I was staying. Even on the plane I could smell the smoke smell in my nose. Like a cloud of cigarette smoke being blown at me, that people can also smell when I blow onto them from my nostrils. I really thought I was imagining the smell, but it is really present in my nose to others as well \n\nThe reason I never went to the doctors with this problem is because whenever I go they shrug everything off. They even laughed at me for a serious problem I once had, which is why I\u2019ve given up on going because I know they won\u2019t take me seriously or help me, so that\u2019s why I have to ask here  \n\nIt makes me feel very sick when it lasts so long, and sometimes I wake up in the night smelling like someone is blowing smoke at me.

Appreciated.\n\nI called my local Emergency and they said it was nothing alarming, but I'm honestly scared right now something wrong is evolving and they're blatantly ignoring it.\n\n**Rant:**\n\nIt's terrible to be told at the phone that I'm young & in great health when I'm telling them I have pale stools, chronic digestive issues, numbness, tingling and weakness in the feet and arms.\n\nI feel like I'm in the wrong country to begin with to get help? Or I don't speak correctly my native language, or am I too naive to try to stay rational at the phone and not being an hysterical mess... ?\n\n**Intro:**\n\nBeen a few days that I'm feeling a growing numbness and paralysis in feet, along with a heat wave, particularly when I eat, but then it goes away within an hour or two.\n\nIt appeared yesterday while eating my oatmeal as bedsnack, and it never went away until I went asleep, whereas **usually** it goes away within minutes.\n\nI've been having this issue at least for 2 weeks, it was happening every few days at the beginning and would last a few minutes at best. Looks like it's evolving to be every day now, almost like every meal...\n\n**What happened:**\n\nI just woke up a few hours earlier and went into eating my oatmeal like usual and :\n\n\\- Numbness, tingling in feet started to appear. No panic yet, I become used to it.\n\nI keep eating and :\n\n\\- I felt a very heavy weight on my mind and whole body, like something or me is going to collapse under something extremely heavy.\n\n\\- I also felt like my heart is going to stop. My body went super silent, I had a short breath and it felt hard to keep it up. It was incredibly scary, the scariest thing I've actually ever experienced for the past few years.\n\nAt this point I start to panic a bit, I called my local emergency for an opinion.\n\nI explain what's happening => Nothing alarming... \"I could send you a doc for checking your reflexes...\"\n\nI'm confused and I say I probably need a bloodwork right now and he answers with \"if the doc says so but your presence right now isn't justified at the emergency room...\". I deny sending me a doc, because I thought by the time he comes in, I'll be either dead or fine, pointless in both cases.\n\nAfter the call, things get worst, numbness goes into my face, then in my whole upper body...\n\nI could still talk (to myself) and laugh with effort, so I tell myself good, probably I won't die...\n\nThe numbness & tingling on my face felt like some kind of paralysis was taking over my body. I was 100% conscious the entire time, aside from the collapsing feeling I was 'trying' to go against.\n\nI felt like flu-like symptoms, weird muscles pains at every joint of my body and I was moving a lot like if I was trying to find a position to alleviate the pain.\n\nWhile going through that last point, I drank plenty of water.\n\nIt's been a while I had a suspicion of electrolytes imbalance, so I thought if it was hyperkalemia, water would wash the excess away,\n\nNow the numbness is almost gone, I have like 10% left in the feet, but it's still quite heavy on my whole body, not to mention the fatigue which is more extreme than usual (which is already quite bad).\n\n**IMPORTANT:**\n\nI took Bactrim 2 weeks ago for an UTI and I lost consciousness for a few seconds, I was paralyzed in my entire body. **I stopped taking it right after that.**\n\nThis was not an allergic reactions. Because the paralysis symptoms I've experienced just a few moment ago are almost identical to when I lost consciousness. Could this really be K related... ? The warnings of the med says Hyperkalemia risks, but considering my chronic digestive issues (SIBO) in that nutrients and calories are badly absorbed (bulky stools), I would be most likely low than high...\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI still feel like I'm going to collapse and very wary about what to do next.\n\nWhat's your opinion on this?\n\nI'm thinking about going for some simple salty rice meal, avoid potassium and calcium entirely for the time being, and drink plenty of water... maybe sodium bicarbonate?\n\nThank you.",

I bleed heavy, and cramp before, during, and after my period. I\u2019d honestly say half of my life is spent in pain due to my cycle. I have an appointment set up with a new gyno in the middle of august but I wanted to post and see if I could get any input before then. I\u2019ve been waiting for this appointment for four months, and I\u2019m super nervous. Before this, I mostly ignored my reproductive health out of fear. \n\nMy biggest concern is I have 2 masses of tissue (?) in my back that I have had for years. I can\u2019t honestly remember when I noticed them. They are right at hip level on my lower back, kind of where some people may have lower back dimples. They are in the same position on both sides. One side is significantly larger than the other. They change in size, and I\u2019ve noticed they seem larger around my period. The largest is the size of a golf ball in my back, but sometimes they\u2019re more penny-sized. They are moveable and you can manipulate them a bit but they never fully go away. Could these be some sort of gland becoming inflamed? The reason I think it\u2019s related to my period is because the majority of the pain on my period centers around those two areas and spreads. The pain in recent times has kept me from getting out of bed. I do TENS, heating pads, baths; no OTC painkiller gives any relief. I have tried everything. \n\nOther helpful info possibly: a fairly irregular cycle, sometimes 2 weeks in between periods, sometimes 3 or 4. I also have a history of ovarian cysts.

Stopped in what seems like maybe 10 seconds after putting the Kindle away. At first I thought maybe my blood pressure or sugar were off, but I checked and both were fine (BP a bit elevated but I'd imagine that's to be expected). Went back to reading thinking that was odd. Happened again after another 20 minutes or so. Didn't make sense to me but I put the Kindle down and did other stuff for a couple hours. Came back to it, and again it happened. Put the Kindle back down and haven't used it since, but had what felt like 1-2 very minor similar incidents while going to bed later.\n\nFinally started looking up symptoms and it feels exactly like the \"auras\" described associated with seizures. I didn't have any motor/muscular symptoms, but everything lines up. I called the only neurology clinics near me and they're all booked into December.

(Carotid/brain/ear vascular issues)\n**About Me:** 39F, 5'7\" 122lbs, white\n\n**Medical Diagnoses:** Costochondritis (mild, comes and goes), major depression, OCD\n\n**Current Medications:** Prozac 20mg (started only a month ago), Xanax 0.5mg as needed\n\n**Current Supplements:** Vitamin D, Vitamin C, fish oil, CoQ10, Lipo Flavanoids (started a few days ago just to see if they help)\n\n**Lifestyle:** Never smoked, drink on occasion (only drink one when I do), active/exercise regularly\n\n**Primary Complaint:** Constant 24/7 high-pitched hissing tinnitus that is sometimes pulsatile. The constant tinnitus is in both ears, though the left ear is often louder and sometimes has an additional tone.\n\n**Details about the pulsatile tinnitus:** The tinnitus is usually constant, but becomes pulsatile when I:\n\n* **Bend over** \\- I'll get about 5 seconds of pulse-synchronous whooshing in both ears. It's not a low-pitched ultrasound noise, it's like my hissing tinnitus pulsing along to my heart (ssssSSSSsssSSSssSSSsssSSS)\n* **Stand up quickly** \\- Again, about 5 seconds of pulse-synchronous whooshing in both ears\n* **Turn my head all the way to the right** \\- Same, about 5 seconds of the whooshing\n\nIf I maintain the positions above, after the 5-ish seconds, the pulsing stops and the tinnitus hisses normally, non-pulsatile.\n\nOther times it is pulsatile is doing hard cardio **exercise**... this is when it pulses the most, I hear 3-5 seconds of whooshing (both ears) on every other exhale when my heart rate is raised and pumping hard. Otherwise, I feel GREAT when I exercise, my heart rate recovers quickly when I stop, no headaches or weakness, etc.\n\nSometimes, I hear the pulsing inside my tinnitus when I first wake up in the morning, or when I wake up from a vivid dream. This can sometimes take a little while to calm down and is sometimes louder in the left ear.\n\nThe constant tinnitus is extremely somatic. I can make it louder by turning my head to the right, bending my neck all the way back, pushing on my forehead, jutting my jaw out, etc. I can even 'fake' the exact sound it makes when it's actually pulse-synchronous by doing these movements... the sound is the same.\n\n**The weirdest thing:** during the times the tinnitus is pulsing, I can STOP the pulsing by closing my teeth together. I CANNOT stop the pulsing by pressing anywhere on my neck or throat (I know that's a common test for vascular PT) I also cannot make a recording of the pulsing, which tells me it is probably a subjective noise and not 'real'.\n\n**Duration of Complaint:** 2-3 years, I don't know exactly, but it's been going on for quite a long time.\n\n**Factors to Consider:** I have a history of going to air shows and concerts without ear protection. I also used to work wedding receptions. For the last several years I have been using AirPods on my 6-7 mile daily walks, and I definitely had the music up way too loud to hear over traffic/outside noise. I know this is why I have the constant tinnitus. What I don't understand is why it is sometimes pulsatile. I protect my hearing now.\n\n**Tests I have had:**\n\n* **Brain MRI, with and without contrast, with IAC protocol:** totally clear and 'normal'\n* **Blood tests:** not anemic, liver and kidney function fine, thyroid levels are normal. Vitamin levels were not tested.\n* **Blood Pressure:** runs low if anything, has never been elevated when measured\n* **Hearing Test:** All thresholds normal, symmetrical hearing, including some extended high frequencies tested\n* **LDL/Tympanometry:** Normal LDLs and normal pressures\n* **Vestibular tests:** found a slight unilateral hypofunction on the RIGHT side, which is my 'better' tinnitus ear.. test was done to diagnose 24/7 rocking dizziness for a few months post-COVID infection. I've since 'compensated' for this and no longer feel dizzy.\n* **Chest CTA/EKG/Echocardiogram:** These were done last month because of a bad septic pneumonia infection, not because of the pulsatile tinnitus, but everything was perfect so I'm including it here just to mention that there probably isn't a cardiac concern.\n* **Eye Exam:** included digital images of my optic nerves, no papilledema seen\n\nI never cared about the noise before until I started being anxious about it, but now it causes me a great deal of anxiety and I listen to it constantly. I feel like I can habituate to it again if I could remove the anxiety that something is really wrong, since Googling 'pulsatile tinnitus' leads you down some scary rabbit holes, which is why I started seeking a doctor to begin with.\n\nI've been seeing an ENT/Neurotologist specialist, who I thought would be the best person for this due to his hyper-specialty but he seems unconcerned about my specific symptoms? I had to push for even the standard contrast brain MRI. He thinks if my PT was anything super concerning it would only ever appear in one ear and would be a more constant 24/7 thing.\n\nI think all of you doctors on here are so generous with your time and expertise, and I'm hoping you can give me some basic advice... **with my specific symptoms should I just put this to rest, or should I be seeking more scans ( brain MRA or carotid ultrasound?) And how urgently should I be seeking this out?**\n\nI'm not really trying to hunt down a cause for the PT, but I DO want to make sure that there's nothing dangerous going on.\n\nI'm really, really struggling with the anxiety. It's led me to restart Prozac after saying, years ago, that I'd never go back on another SSRI.\n\n(edited to include eye exam info, fixed typos)",

She did have diabetes after the surgery but that has also resolved. Now, 3.5 years later, my mom is facing the prospect of a kidney transplant. Apparently the anti rejection drugs are very toxic and as such, her kidney function is severely compromised. She had 1 hospitalization in march 2022 for kidney failure (it was terrifying)which kept her in the hospital an entire month. \n\nIn the last 3 months she has lost 30 pounds and weighs 97lbs now, about 5\u20195. The stress levels for our family have been huge, so that is definitely playing a huge role. \n\n6 weeks ago she was told dialysis is imminent with kidney functioning levels at 18. \n\nShe met with her care team on Wednesday this week and they said her kidney function is up to 30 now and they aren\u2019t looking at dialysis on the same timeline. They were quite shocked at the recovery. \n\nShe\u2019s supposed to meet with a vascular surgeon anyways so they can assess her for a port, as they feel it is inevitable she will eventually need dialysis. \n\nMy mom is in discomfort all the time. Her headaches, the horrible leg cramps every night, bowel issues, all of it is so much to endure for 1 person, her medication is life sustaining but it\u2019s also slowly killing her. Her kidney issues make it difficult for her to eat because her diet is so restricted. I\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t want the kidney Transplant because life is already so difficult with transplanted lungs. I\u2019m hoping to be the one to donate a kidney if she will proceed. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1.  Is it unusual for her kidney function to go up and down so much? \n\n2. if the situation Becomes acute, can she get dialysis right away or will they try to do a transplant immediately? \n\n3. Will the kidney transplant be physically easier to recover from than the lung transplant? \n\nSorry if this post is scattered, things are very difficult right now. \n\nMy mom is the centre of my world\u2026thank you very much for taking the time to read this.

We have chosen not to become legally married but consider ourselves in a domestic partnership (I mention this to note that while i consider him my husband and am dedicated to him as such, I don\u2019t have the legal rights a legal spouse might have).\n\nBackground details about him: He is white (non-Hispanic) and we live in the USA. He is a 37-year-old cisgender man. He has had long-standing mental health problems (mostly extreme anxiety) since getting sepsis at age 14 which he barely survived. He used to be a heavy drinker before we got together but rarely drinks now. He also used to smoke cigarettes (about 8 a day) and marijuana, but for the past month has cut back on both considerably. He drinks about one energy drink w caffeine daily. He doesn\u2019t do any other recreational drugs. He is prescribed vyvanse, gabapentin, and viibryd for daily use and he *says* he\u2019s been taking them, but I strongly suspect based on the pills he has on hand and his behavior that he hasn\u2019t been for probably 1.5-2 months. He also was prescribed Xanax for occasional panic attacks (so not for daily use) but I don\u2019t think he has taken any in probably 2+ months. He hasn\u2019t seen his psychiatrist in months either. The past year or so was an extremely stressful year for him at work, with the worst occurring about mid-spring of this year, and it was definitely rough for him considering his mental health problems. \n\nCurrent problem: for the past two months he has been declining in every way. He hasn\u2019t showered in at least a month and will only occasionally use bathing wipes I bought for him. He stopped going to work and won\u2019t get a job. He lost his phone for several weeks and had no interest in finding it, so he had to get a new one. He doesn\u2019t spend any time with me and was incredibly rude to his family when they visited last week. He sleeps a lot and spends much of his waking hours in a daze. But most concerningly, he\u2019s become increasingly difficult to converse with. Half of what he says doesn\u2019t make any sense or is filled with non-sequiters. When we went out to eat with his family, he couldn\u2019t even order for himself because he was in a daze. He makes strange jokes and doesn\u2019t remotely understand why me and his parents are concerned. Nor does he understand why he lost his job or why finding a job would be important. We have begged him to see a doctor and he won\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d need to. My husband used to be an extremely hard-worker, always kept up to date on cleaning the house, showered daily, and was very intelligent. We loved watching movies together and playing board games. Now he\u2019s a completely different person and I miss him so much.\n\nHis parents live in another state and the only reason they came here this past week was because I told them I was becoming very concerned. When they visited they agreed that something is wrong, and as the visit progressed they started to suspect, as I do, that despite my partner\u2019s mental health history, this may be something more than a psychiatric problem. It is genuinely hard to describe unless you interact with him, but to us his behavior may indicate something is neurologically, or possibly hormonally, wrong beyond mental illness.\n\nI have reached a point where I have no idea what to do. I have been googling advice and everything tells me either 1) do nothing bc he can make his own decisions, even though I don\u2019t think he\u2019s mentally well enough to do so, or 2) have him admitted to a psych hospital. I am open to the 2nd option if needed, however he is not suicidal or threatening harm to himself or others so idk if it would be an option and regardless, I really think he should be given a full medical evaluation before defaulting to psychiatric hospitalization. But I also don\u2019t know if I would be able to have him admitted to a regular hospital since this may not be an \u201cemergency.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m panicking at this point y\u2019all. It\u2019s hard to work, hard to sleep, hard to eat. And financially we\u2019re hurting. I am so afraid I\u2019m not only losing my husband as a partner, but that he could possibly be really sick. His parents are also confused about what steps to take going forward. Please, I really need advice on what, if anything, I can do to help him. Sorry if this is long or confusing, I\u2019m frazzled at this point.",

        "context": "Sinus pressure on palate after jaw surgery\nHi all,\n\nI am currently 32, male.  I am obese and take medications for blood pressure and anxiety.  I was born with an underbite and crossbite and so at approx. age 25 I started a two part orthognathic surgical process to correct this.  The first surgery, a SARPE (surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion) was uneventful, but the bone-borne palatal expander that was implanted in the roof of my mouth fractured a week after surgery (while being activated via the wrench provided) and was prematurely removed, while the doctors maintained the transverse width that I had achieved to that point and move forward with orthodontics in preparation for the second surgery.  The second surgery, a Le Fort I osteotomy, advanced the maxilla forward.  I then had several additional months of orthodontics.\n\nAfter the braces were removed it was clear that my crossbite remained, likely as a result of inadequate expansion of the maxilla because of the palatal expander failure.  I was recommended for a revision surgery which I had done in 2019.  The new surgeon removed the hardware (plates and screws) from the Le Fort I osteotomy and repeated the SARPE procedure from scratch.  \n\nAfter this repeat SARPE surgery, the upper right quadrant of teeth either shifted downward entirely or the teeth erupted downward and I suffered root resorption and gum recession on almost all right side maxillary as a result.  I also developed a burning sensation in the right side of the hard palate, and a sensation of fullness/inflation when I breathe through my nose.  If I perform a Valsalva maneuver and breathe into my nose I feel air pressure on almost all teeth on the right side of the maxilla (and not the left), and it feels as if something is \"inflating\" between my right-side hard palate/teeth and the floor of my right nostril.  Additionally, if I shift my mandible left to right it activates a sort of suction/popping that is both clearly audible but also felt in those same areas of the palate/nasal floor.  I do not believe this popping is coming from the jaw joints (TMJ).\n\nA recent CT scan at my periodontist showed fluid in the right maxillary sinus, but other than that my jaw surgeon (who did the revision) has offered no explanation, and neither has any orthodontist or the periodontist himself.  The periodontist has recommended seeing an ENT which I am doing next month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestions: \n\n1. Why did the right side of my maxilla/those teeth shift downward after the revision SARPE procedure?\n2. Why did the gums recede on those teeth at the same time as the downward shift?\n3.

My question is, how exactly does constipation happen in the bowels? If my son takes high enough doses of stool softeners and laxatives, he'll have one or two mushy poops per day. If he misses a dose or gets a smaller dose, the next day he will still poop, but it will be hard and small. The next day pebbles, and the day after that, he stops pooping altogether. When he gets back on the laxatives, he will go back and forth between pooping water and pooping pebbles until his stool gets back to normal consistency & frequency. \n\nHow could he go from soft wet poops to hard poops within a day? Wouldn't it need to be in his colon longer to get that hard? Does it mean that too much water is being pulled from his intestines? He doesn't seem dehydrated - he wets diapers well, has a wet mouth, cries tears, and drinks water all day long as well as milk bottles. He also eats lots of fiber. \n\nThank you! ",

Naturally i started googling and assumed it might be dysmenorrhea related to my menstrual cycle.  Not sure that\u2019s it\u2019s relevant but i do have PMDD.  I noticed it came back the following month and the month after that.  It\u2019s back now and it\u2019s not going away, it\u2019s more sore now than 2 weeks ago when it came back.  I am concerned that it may be something more serious.  The pain is consistent, sometimes it\u2019s uncomfortable to walk.  I have been working so much lately and extremely stressed out, I have been up at 4-4:30Am, logging in between 5:30 and 8 (my day starts at 8) and working anywhere from 5:30PM to 7 and beyond (day ends at 5).  I work from home and I am just sitting all day, often on one of my legs or with my legs crossed.  I did not injure my leg recently (although 14 years ago I did have a ride on lawnmower slam in to me and pin me to a wall for a minute leaving me with bruising and a dent in the left side of my quad on my left leg).  This feels like it\u2019s inside my thigh around the bone and it is radiating up to my left buttock.  I don\u2019t have a back issue.  I was also diagnosed with CRPS as a result of a SIRVA injury to my left arm. I\u2019ve been experiencing a lot of pain radiating down to my left elbow as well I thought may be somehow related to the CRPS.  There is a bruise forming as of today and I have not hit my arm at all.  I am not sure if these are all related to my CRPS possibly spreading or if this could be something more serious.",

        "context": "Tick bite on scalp, swollen lymph nodes behind ear\nMy 11-yo daughter pulled a tick off her scalp on Sunday. I sent a pic of the tick to an ID service (and did some research), and it was a female dog tick that had been feeding for approx 3 days. She was able to pull it off, but it took a bit of skin with it. Yesterday, she noticed a bump behind her ear, and I saw that the two lymph nodes behind her ear (about 2\u201d down from the bite) are swollen. They\u2019re rubbery and every so slightly tender, but not super painful. The lower one is about the size of a pencil eraser and the upper one is smaller, but still enlarged. They definitely were not there a week or so ago, I was helping her put earrings in last week and would have noticed. The actual bite spot is a little crusty and was quite red when she pulled it off, but it\u2019s not too irritated now. Just a little scab. The tick was on there for about 3 days, though. \nWe live in a Lyme-heavy area, but this type of tick doesn\u2019t transmit Lyme, so I wasn\u2019t overly concerned, but now I\u2019m not sure if she should take prophylactic antibiotics in case it\u2019s another tick-borne illness. Her doc is not concerned and said the bite and the nodes or could not be related but also that tick bites don\u2019t typically cause swollen nodes (though I\u2019ve read differently). Any thoughts? Could a scalp bite cause the postauricular nodes to swell just due to the irritation, or is it worth it to pursue abx?",

Growing up it was the seam of my sock that would bother me. When camping I sometimes feel bugs crawling on me even when there are no bugs present.  Starting in High School, I began to experience extreme sensitivity to the collar of my shirt resting on the front of my neck, and this symptom persists now. \n\nThe sensation is as though I am being tickled by a feather, which is highly distracting, makes me physically cringe, and worsens my anxiety symptoms. It occurs primarily when I wear a shirt with a rounded, average to tight collar. Loose collars present less of an issue and v-neck or loose button downs cause no issue. When wearing a rounded collar shirt, the symptoms worsen the further I lean backward, with lying completely flat leading to completely unbearable neck stimulation. Leaning forward reduces collar contact with my neck and relieves symptoms.\n\nSome potentially relevant background info:\n\nI have clinically diagnosed moderate anxiety, which I do not take medication for, but go to therapy. Anxiety flare ups lead to anxious tics (blinking, flexing certain muscles, cracking hands and neck, etc.) and OCD-like symptoms (need for bodily symmetry, intrusive thoughts). Questionnaires have confirmed I do not meet criteria for OCD, and I would agree it is not to that severity. I have been previously diagnosed with ADHD, then a second opinion psychiatrist told me I had bipolar type 2, but I'm skeptical of both these diagnoses (first one, I was pushing for the diagnosis to get Adderall, second one doctor was highly unprofessional and the depressive episode I was in at the time was linked to an adverse life event). \n\nI am not entirely convinced my neck sensitivity symptoms are fully psychosomatic, because it remains in the presence of low anxiety, however anxiety does worsen my ability to cope with neck tactile sensitivity. Neck sensitivity also increases anxiety symptoms. \n\nI have been coping by resting my hand on my upper chest, pulling collar off my neck, and leaning forward (which has lead to poor posture). I also have to be very particular with the shirts I wear, especially if I plan to be sitting for extended periods of time. \n\nI am hoping to either find new strategies to cope with this sensitivity, potential diagnoses, or recommendations for professionals I should see to address it. \n\nAny thought are appreciated, thank you!",

On birth control, spironolactone, buproprion, fluoxetine, and Zyrtec.\n\nI was diagnosed with IBS-D and internal hemorrhoids in 2014. This was after ruling out Crohn's disease through a colonoscopy/upper endoscopy - they initially thought I might have Crohn's because I reported some blood in my stool (not a lot, just enough for me to notice) and wanted to be sure it was just IBS. I had a course of antibiotics for it in I thiiink 2016? Since then I still have flare-ups/sensitivities to certain foods but not as bad as they used to be - it used to be that I'd have diarrhea no matter what I ate or how I was feeling and it felt totally random. I've never had treatment for the hemorrhoids - I was told they'd go away on their own. \n\nLast week, I had two back-to-back instances of blood in my stool. But like, a lot of blood. Like, \"I would think I was on my period because of how much blood there is in the toilet\" blood. The stool is normal \u2013 i.e. not diarrhea \u2013 but I did feel a little constipated, in that it felt like it took a long time to actually happen, even though I felt like I urgently had to go, and I had a bit of stomach cramping. \n\nI have had this happen twice before, but the last one was several months ago and the one before that was a few years ago.

There is a cluster of lymph nodes on the right side of my neck (tonsil area) that are swollen. I have seen general doctors and specialists about it but have no answer yet.\n\nThey're painful to the touch and become sore if I manipulate them too much. Some days, I cannot feel them and they don't bother me. Other days, they're sore and the discomfort radiates to my ear and makes it uncomfortable to move my head a certain way and to swallow.\n\nDuring exams, doctor said that my throat and tonsils look fine and not inflamed.\n\nOn blood tests, there is no apparent issue:\n- Blood cells are fine\n- Thyroid is fine\n- CRP is high but has always been high since I have endometriosis\n- Negative for Epstein-Barr, CMV, toxoplasmosis, Basedow  \n- Negative for STIs\n\nDuring cervical ultrasound, specialist noticed that the lymph nodes were enlarged (+ a 4mm cyst on my thyroid that didn't worry me because I've had 10+cm cysts on my ovaries) but said it looked noncancerous so I shouldn't worry. \n\nI've seen the doctor again and have done multiple blood tests, all showing the same results.\n\nI have no other swollen lymph nodes on any part of my body (that I know of). I have night sweats and chronic fatigue but those are likely related to endometriosis because I've had them since before the nodes appeared.\n\nI am on dienogest and ethinylestradiol (daily) to manage endometriosis stage 4 (+ I take painkillers like paracetamol, NSAIDs, codein depending on pain level, not daily).\n\nI am 22F, located in France, don't smoke, don't drink, eat healthy and exercise regularly. \n\nHas any of you ever seen a case like this?

We went A to V...You never go A to V. \n\nHowever, the aching, stinging feeling after pee went away and I started to develop serious pain in my right side, under my ribs which feels worse in the morning/ at night when I'm less active, but it still hurts when I take a deep breath, cough, or laugh, kind of like one of my ribs is broken but I haven't had any trauma like that. It also feels muscular, but when I've tried to stretch and massage, it doesn't help. I also will get sharp cramps in my right ovary periodically. Ive also noted the bloating from my period hasnt gone down. I don't have a fever, and I sleep well until I try to lay on my left side, which triggers the pain in my right. \n\nI go for my PAP test once a year or every 2 years and they've always come back normal. \nCould this be a cyst? Can I have a cyst that doctors never noticed? Should I seek medical treatment or can I wait it out? I don't have a family doctor in my new city yet and don't feel comfortable going to a walk-in for a possible gynecological exam with a stranger/male doctor.\n\nEdit: I've had kidney stones before, and in my experience the pain was in the lower back and more of a dull pain, this pain seems to be more under the ribs and right ovary so idk",

There aren\u2019t many ocular cancer specialists so one of the few out here is very busy. He removed my suspicious eye mole and it turned out to be benign. Good news. The attending ocular cancer doc said I didn\u2019t need him anymore since I don\u2019t have cancer, and that the new intern would remove my eye sutures since my eye was pretty much done healing. Attending left the room. \n\nThe intern put numbing drops and a speculum on my eye and removed three sutures, then tried twice to remove one more. He finally stopped and said we were done. I asked if all the sutures were out and he said no. He said he could keep trying to remove the last one but that cause more irritation and make the suture go deeper into the eye, and I should just wait two to four weeks for it to dissolve. It would probably be sooner he said because it was a smaller piece of stitch. I was really disappointed about that because the stitches have been so uncomfortable in the two weeks since the mole removal surgery, and I still can\u2019t drive properly because looking too far to the left is painful.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize until I got home an hour later that maybe I should have asked for the attending to finish pulling the sutures out. I waited a day, then I called the clinic back to see if I could get in with an attending ophthalmologist to try removing the final stitch again. The receptionist put me on hold for a long time, said my ophthalmologist is out on vacation, and said she\u2019d get back to me in 24 hours to schedule with the next available provider who could do it. \n\nAny thoughts or advice would be appreciated, have been feeling down about this and having a painful stitch stuck in my eye.",

I also get random stomach bugs quite often like campylobacter, Hepatitis A, and C. Diff ( I dont cook meat in my house lol) that show they come and go with stool tests and antibiotics. I\u2019ve had a colonoscopy and endoscopy which didn\u2019t find anything other than mild gastritis in my stomach. HIDA scan was normal and so was PillCam Endoscopy. I\u2019ve had CT with contrast and ultrasound which also found nothing. Most of my bloodwork is normal other than high gastrin and chromogranin A, and some liver counts are slightly off.

My primary who i see every week is at a loss of what to do. Because **my results seem like everything is fine** the doctor at mount sinai said it\u2019s just IBS and there\u2019s nothing we can really do. I\u2019m sick of doctors not taking me seriously/dismissing me and throwing me around.

For example one semester in college I only ate like once per week, and I did lose weight. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering if my mom is just being hopeful somehow that this isn\u2019t my fault and I have some medical condition or if a more objective party actually thinks it would be a good idea to go see a doctor and ask about a thyroid panel. \n\nThanks!

Caucasian. \nEver since I was about 13 I\u2019ve had very irregular periods. Sometimes going for months. But it\u2019s been 6 months or more and I haven\u2019t had one. About a month or so ago my breasts randomly out of the blue started to swell. There is absolutely no way I could be pregnant as I am not sexually active, so that is ruled out. \nAnd for the last month they have been tender and painful to touch. The right one seems to be a bit fuller than the left one. And about a week ago, I noticed that I felt something weird on the right one. Closer to the top of the breast I felt a little, squishy, movable, oval shaped lump there. It\u2019s almost hard to feel unless I lay back. I have no other symptoms such as dimpling, texture changes, discharge, armpit lumps or anything else. Just the small lump and the pain. I suspect I have a hormone imbalance perhaps but I am worried about the lump. The anxiety is killing me because I don\u2019t know what it is. And I don\u2019t want to go to the doctor because I absolutely hate being touched by people in that way.",

I grind my teeth and wear a night guard so I was wearing it. One night I awoke with severe pain and a couple glands on the side I had my dental work were swollen and continued to hurt but after a day they went back down and the pain went away. I went back to have my dental work completed and as soon as it was done I had pain (which is to be expected) but the glands again swelled up. One located just below the jaw would become angry anytime I tried to chew on that side. The dentist said that this had nothing to do with any of the procedure , he ended up adjusting the tooth and it seemed to improve. However that side still feels odd to me (almost like a burning in a small spot along the jaw line) and I have seen the doctor twice and had fluid in my ear so I have been prescribed an antibiotic. The inside of the ear is very sensitive. I also however had perforated my eardrum on that side as well back in November 2022 but it had healed. So I\u2019m not sure if that could be the reason for the ear infections and sensitivity, although I did have an ear infection right after my perforation had healed so I figured that was the cause of the ear infections.\n\nShortly after I had my dental procedure I noticed that my night guard had black spots on it. I didn\u2019t really think much of it I just continued to clean my night guard daily soaking in a solution. I thought the spots were due to me always forgetting to remove it from the solution and letting it soak for longer than the recommended time. but the black spots don\u2019t go away and now I am worried it is black mold. I have not been wearing it but was wearing it not thinking about mold. I am now worried the symptoms I am feeling are related to mold. Could it be possible for mold to have gotten into my tooth and it is now growing inside? Which is why I am still experiencing the symptoms in my ear and jawline?\n\nI have been diagnosed with ADHD and I do have chronic pain as well as frequent migraines. So lack of focus and inattentiveness as well as my head and body hurting is normal for me. I don\u2019t have a fever or chills or anything like that.

Currently presenting with symptoms indicative of partial SBO and consistent with prior pattern of high grade SBO formation. \n\nMy doctor has advised me that my current symptoms are consistent with another problematic adhesion forming and ordered me to stick to a rigid low residue diet indefinitely, with the assumption that I will eventually likely need further surgical intervention if it progresses to complete SBO. \n\nMy general question is what is the long term viability of a jpouch if this pattern continues? From my understanding,  repeated laparotomies every 1-2 years will only continue to make the situation with adhesions exponentially worse. Is there anything that could be done non-operatively to help prevent further repeated laparotomies from adhesion-related SBO? \n\nAlso, I couldn't seem to find a clear answer in the literature: if further operations and adhesions are more or less guaranteed either way, could I be any better off returning to a permanent ileostomy?   I've tried to research the rates of SBO after ileostomy vs ipaa, but there doesn't seem to be a clear consensus and little research specifically on the ileostomy side of it to begin with. \n\nI realize it may be a dumb question, but figure it can't hurt to ask since I am willing to try almost anything if it improves my quality of life.

Even just suggesting what specialist to see would be greatly appreciated. I\u2019m getting increasingly fearful.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to summarise as best I can below:\n\n\nJuly 6th - First Episode \n\nDuring a run, I felt a sudden numbness in my left arm, shoulder down. I then felt light headed, like I was going to black out, and later experienced some chest pain (particularly when swallowing).\n\nI chalked this up to dehydration, and two days later boarded a flight for a weeklong holiday. During this time, I felt the numbness return when exerting myself.\n\nJuly 15th - Flight\n\nA little over a week after this first episode, I boarded a flight back home. Ten minutes before boarding I felt the numbness in my arm and lightheadedness return, though much more intense. During the flight, the symptoms became much worse, I experienced numbness all over my body, including my face and lips, as well as chest pain.\n\nI laid down with my legs raised, then ate some food and drank water and juice. After around an hour, the numbness and lightheadedness felt much less intense. After around three hours, both sensations returned. I was sent to the hospital as soon as I landed. \n\nJuly 16th -  Hospital\n\nThe Hospital performed blood tests, an ECG, a CT scan of my chest, and listened to my heart. I also received an Ultrasound. They did not observe anything abnormal. I went home and slept, the symptoms continued.\n\n\nJuly 17-20th -  Home and Doctor\n\nI still feel numbness occasionally, I\u2019m still having  chest tightness and pain, the main issue now being my head feeling lots of pressure, and quite heavy. If I walk more than a minute it gets really bad, my head feels really numb and my tongue feels heavy. Lying down seems to alleviate the heavy headedness.\n\nI\u2019ve had diarrhoea twice over this period, and random aches all over my body. \n\nAll blood tests are coming back clear, the doctors are running out of things to try. I was given all the usual blood tests for the heart (sorry I don\u2019t know the name). As well as stool and urine tests for bacteria or infections. \n\nThey did a brain scan and discovered a 47mm uncomplicated retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst in my brain, initially my doctor doesn\u2019t believe it could be making me have these symptoms. I\u2019ll be waiting a while to see a neurologist.\n\n\n\nOther information \n\nOn June 25th and July 1st I had been doing cocaine, I\u2019d also been drinking and vaping quite a bit on these weekends, as well as the week in between episodes (holiday). I haven\u2019t drank or smoked (or anything else) since the July 15th episode. Doctors think because the episode was 5 days after going out it\u2019s likely not the cause. \n\n\nThe doctors can\u2019t find anything to do with circulation, but the fact it happens after moving upright makes me think it has to be right?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Like I said even just recommending a specialist \ud83d\ude4f\n\n\n\n\n****one last thing If you\u2019re still reading.

Started October 2021-ish. I had a bisalpingectomy; during the procedure I had a catheter in, and afterwards developed a UTI. I\u2019ve had a few before, and this one like all the other was able to be treated with antibiotics. Since then though I have had issues where I can\u2019t empty my bladder fully. I have to push, which I know you\u2019re not supposed to do. No pain, just discomfort since it feels like I still have to pee after I\u2019ve just gone. The surgery is one event I can pinpoint so it was my initial assumption for why I\u2019m dealing with this, but after thinking on it, I did start my job that I\u2019m currently in around the same time as well. Before that I worked in an office.\n\nI work in conservation biology. I\u2019m almost always in remote areas when I\u2019m working, so I don\u2019t have access to a bathroom. Thus, I need to find somewhere and squat. Lately I\u2019ve been having some issues with urinary retention, so I saw a urologist, and she said that it\u2019s bad for women to squat to pee as it puts a lot of strain on the pelvic floor muscles, and as such it could be part of the reason for the issue I\u2019m experiencing. I was found to be holding I think 50ml? of urine after peeing during my appointment.\n\nIs this true? Did women not squat to pee before toilets became a common thing, and don\u2019t a lot of people without regular access to one squat? Is standing bad too? \n\nWe will be doing a urodynamic test next week, and she was curious about squatting and what effect it has on the pelvic floor and all that, so I offered to try to squat during the testing so we can do a little experiment. But I wanted to ask here to get some more opinions until then out of curiosity.  She even said that she would \u201calmost rather me hold it than squat\u201d which seems crazy to me, seeing as I work 10 hour days. Holding my pee that long I would think would be worse. She suggested to even get a small children\u2019s training toilet\u2026 which is not an option. Not only is that impractical to carry around with me while I am doing field work, but as a woman in a heavily male dominated field, there is no way I would feel comfortable carrying around a training toilet and whipping it out any time I have to pee. I\u2019ve already had some male coworkers act surprised that I, A WOMAN WOW!!, will pee outside\u2026 which is also crazy because what else do I do? Not pee all day?? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f lol. \n\nLast, if it\u2019s bad to squat, would standing be better, worse, the same? I know those she-wee things exist, and wouldn\u2019t be too bad to use if it helps. Much more discrete and portable. I thought of it after my appointment, so I plan on asking her this too.\n\nIf anyone has any other theories why I\u2019m experiencing this, please feel free to weigh in. I\u2019m not old enough to be dealing with this yet, and I\u2019m really worried. \ud83d\ude1e",

My cardiologist was very condescending and said my issues, specifically worsening issues, such as extreme chest pain, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, feeling a cold fluid feeling in my chest, my swollen abdomen and feet, and a hard cough, were just the result of stress and anxiety. I asked for an updated echocardiogram since I had one last year and much has change with my symptoms. I was denied and said an echo was absolutely not needed in my case. \n\nI went to my primary care who was also condescending and said it was anxiety. At the point of anger and tears I told her I felt like I\u2019m dying and I needed help. She said she was not a cardiologist but if it would help me feel better she would order an echocardiogram at the local hospital. \n\nMonday I had the echo. Wednesday I was diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease affecting both the mitral and tricuspid valves. There is still no urgency from my care team. I\u2019m being ignored by my PCP. My cardiologist gave a half-hearted \u201cwe\u2019ll request the echo records\u201d when I called them. I feel even worse. My chest pain now only ends when I feel a burst of fluid that feels like it fills my chest and neck. I\u2019m having trouble breathing all the time. But if I have a feeling if I traveled to the ER again, I\u2019d be dismissed right away just like I was before in pregnancy and earlier postpartum.

From Brazil. \n\nI have been to a private hospital concerning some moles. The derm told me it was suspicious and recommended me mole mapping and to return after a month for us to proceed regarding biopsy information and etc. I did the mapping and returned to the doctor but the doctor refereed me to another derm at the hospital because she doesn\u2019t do biopsy. She assured it was probably nothing but a precaution for me to biopsy my suspicious mole.\nShe called the other doctor right off the bat and asked him to request a biopsy in the hospital.\n He agreed over the phone and she gave me his contact. I messaged him after and he said he did, but when i tried to schedule, the hospital said i couldn\u2019t as i didn\u2019t have the biopsy request recorded under my name in the system. The second doctor didn\u2019t reply me anymore, i don\u2019t have the contact of the first and the hospital wasn\u2019t that much helpful. I contacted and asked them to contact the doctor. They said they were waiting for the doctor to give them a  reply\u2026\n I wasted a month dealing with these. \nEither i make a new appointment and start all over again to get the request. \nThe appointment i payed out my pocket and planned to pay the biopsy too out of my pocket even thought it is really expensive  because i was really anxious. The mapping too. I don\u2019t have health insurance plan. My fault, i wasn\u2019t that conscious of my health begore. Learned my lesson because everything was really expensive.\n\nSince the first doctor told me before i didn\u2019t need to panic and rush that much and all the scheduling with the hospital was stressful and very bureaucratic and a big waste of time, almost a month and in the end i still didn\u2019t get my biopsy done i decided to look for a health plan and get the biopsy more calmly.  After all, health insurance  would give me a peace of mind, the price be a bit more reasonable and a be safety net . Been talking to insurance plans sellers and we are almost sealing the deal. \n\nBut yesterday night i noticed the skin of my mole was dry.

        "context": "20M blood on stool, irritation, frequent bowel movements\nHi all,\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, I noticed quite the itch that was going on in my back door. I figured it was hygiene related, so I went to the bathroom, had a good wipe, and carried on with my day. The itch persisted, accompanied by blood on the stool that was about the size of a dime. The blood seemed fresh, bright red. This has been going on since then, and I seem to be visiting the bathroom quite a lot more frequently. Maybe about 4-5 times a day. The colour of the stool is a light brown, nothing too out of the ordinary for me. My symptoms also include some stomach discomfort in the mornings, but it\u2019s usually a good 30 mins after my morning coffee so I assume it is that. \nThe itch and discomfort seem to go away for a bit after a warm bath or prep h wipes, but worsen with any movement or sweat. It\u2019s to the point where it\u2019s almost unbearable however. I have spoken to my family doctor who cannot assess me for another 4 weeks, I\u2019m at a loss. My assumption would be hemorrhoids or fissures, but my symptoms were first sudden, and have been consistently worsening by each day. Could this be something more serious, and worth a trip to the ER? \nAny help or insight is appreciated. \nThanks",

I used to get a cold sore 2-4 times a year from childhood through high school. In college, I had a cold sore like 1-2 times freshman year. From sophomore year up until the end of senior year of college (~3 years) I was able to completely prevent them with healthier habits. However, winter of senior year I was under a lot of stress and eating a bit worse, and got a cold sore. Fast forward a little over 6 months later, I had the worse coldsore outbreak I had ever had (a literally ring around my lip) that was definitely triggered by sun, stress, and not continuing healthy habits. My immune system was definitely down. I had a similar experience in December (ring around the lip outbreak). In December, I began taking Valtrex suppressive therapy (500mg/day) and have now been taking it for 7 months. I have been reading about how Valtrex can be less effective over time and cause worse outbreaks when stopped if taken for too long. Im wondering if I should stop Valtrex suppression dosages and try to go back to preventing cold sores with my immunity the way I was able to in college? Do I need to worry about getting an outbreak the moment I stop medicating?",

Splotchy.\" I looked down then started looking over myself and I'm covered in areas varying from little red bumps to entire red patches.

Since I was running a fever and under layers of blankets all night, is it likely it's just a heat rash?

My treatment thus far has only been birth control to regulate my periods. Without the birth control I would only get my period every 6 months or so. I have been on my current form or bc (Nuvaring) for about 3 years. About 2 years ago I went into urgent care for very heavy bleeding that would not stop. My hormones were tested at the time and they suggested I may have a pituitary tumor. An MRI later the only thing found was a Rathke\u2019s cleft cyst. \n\nFast forward to the past year, I have been seeing a naturopath where I have found that I have low progesterone which I am now taking HRT for and most recently low estrogen which I will begin HRT for as well. My most recent values (5mo on 150mg of progesterone) were Progesterone: 2.0 ng/mL and Estradiol: <5.0 pg/mL with the draw taken during the luteal phase. I\u2019m concerned about my sudden drop in estradiol as my last value 8 months ago was 19.7 pg/mL and also is luteal.\n\nI also have had issues with insulin resistance with my A1C consistently sitting at 5.7 for until my most recent blood work which was 5.4. I attribute the change to the addition of a 24 hour fast once a week and a myo-inositol and D chiro supplement I began taking.

I ate what most teens and 20 year olds do. However, around 2 years ago I gained almost 30 lbs out of nowhere and have not been able to get back down to 125 or even 135. I did a gut healing protocol with a very very strict diet (no sugar, gluten, dairy, corn, fermented products) and was able to get down to 145-148 (depending on the day), but since then the scale has not budged. I am a fairly active person and workout anywhere between 4-6 days a week for a minimum of an hour, this usually hot yoga, sculpt class, or walking/hiking. It seems like no matter how much or how little I exercise and how restricted I eat nothing helps. It sucks because I\u2019m only 23 and I want to be able to go out with friends and not have to pay attention to every speck of food I put in my mouth. \n\nI guess my questions are: is there something else going on or is this a cause of the cyst or the PCOS?

She\u2019s been getting the run-around from doctors. Severe diagnoses that she\u2019s told they won\u2019t do anything about because it isn\u2019t severe enough. She\u2019s getting worse by the day and she\u2019s too sick to travel to neighboring states with better medical care. I would like to see what everyone thinks; maybe they have ideas these doctors haven\u2019t thought of? I\u2019m desperate to get her the proper treatment. Please bear with me while I describe everything that\u2019s going on as some of it is from my childhood. \n\nMy mom has been very sick for a few years now. She has had health issues due to alcohol abuse such as going into afib sporadically while I was growing up. It was usually just a weekend at the hospital and she was okay. I want to say she\u2019s been at high risk for a stroke because of this? If not, she certainly is now. \n\nShe used to smoke methamphetamine (I can\u2019t remember how much or for how long) and she smoked marijuana for about 40 years. So, she\u2019s always had something of a cough. \n\nI wish I could remember exactly what her symptoms were when all of this started but we didn\u2019t talk very much during that time. I do remember she was having reactions on her skin to what seemed like anything and everything. The doctors gave her a prescription for some sort of cortisol cream but I can\u2019t remember if it ever helped her. I don\u2019t think so or else she would have used it consistently and I don\u2019t think she did. \n\nShe was diagnosed with ITP (I can\u2019t remember when) and as far as we know it\u2019s in remission. However, when her health started to decline she was unable to take medications for what was happening because she was allergic to the meds or she couldn\u2019t take them with ITP. \n\nWhen she moved states, the skin issues exasperated. The climate is dry, windy, high plains. She also contracted COVID at least 3x since moving. We believe the wind exasperated her cough. Her tests show that it looks like her lungs are full of \u201cground up glass.\u201d She was given an inhaler to help but whenever she uses it she gets thrush. Not sure where this fits in but she also came down with the shingles a few times. She actually has a spot right now that is healing. \n\nAt this point, her cough is getting worse, she\u2019s extremely uncomfortable and in quite a bit of pain daily. She\u2019s feeling run down and sore (she also has fibromyalgia). Here, there\u2019s another bit of time that we weren\u2019t in touch much so I can\u2019t speak to the progression to what\u2019s going on now. Her health just continued to decline. \n\nTo skip over the details of her being sickly over the next (I wanna say) year.. she has been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis and she has a growing cyst on her heart. We do have an oxygen concentrator at home, fortunately. However, her oxygen will still drop down to the high 80\u2019s-lower 90\u2019s if she does the slightest bit of activity. I\u2019m talking, she ran out of breath sitting at the table chopping veggies. She has been waiting now over a month to see a heart surgeon to know if she will require open heart surgery. They wrote down her appointment on the card they gave her and then called to let her know she missed it. The reality is-they wrote down the wrong date. Or, they messed up on the schedule. So now, she has to wait another month (2 months now) to know if she will need the surgery while her symptoms progress. \n\nShe has been fevered almost constantly. Stubbornness is a family trait and the hospital isn\u2019t a fun place to be so she tried riding out a fever of 103 for about a week. I assume this made everything worse. Now, she gets very dizzy to where the whole room spins if she does too much activity (like taking a bath, even). Possibly related? \n\nThere have been a few incidents of her legs or arms randomly giving out on her and her falling down. About a month ago, she was told that she ruptured a disc in her low back. I expect that may have something to do with this? \n\nToday, my grandma had to call 911 and have her rushed to the hospital in an ambulance (I am out of town). She woke up with her oxygen levels in the 60\u2019s and fevered again. There would have been no way for her to even get herself out of bed. She is in the hospital now and being monitored but I don\u2019t have an update other than that. \n\nAny thoughts/suggestions? She just turned 50 in June and nobody else in our family has problems like this.",

No history of drug use, occasional smoking and drinking. \n\nI had recently undergone two procedures for a Root Canal on tooth #10. First being a Calcium Hydroxide treatment, second being the actual Root Canal Therapy. Now, even with this, my original endodontist had said this may not be enough and recommended me for an Apicoectomy procedure. I understand that this is a last ditch effort and there is a good likelihood I am going to lose the tooth. I am trying to figure how soon should I expect symptoms to arise, if any.\n\nPrior to the procedures, I was completely unawars of any issues with this tooth. I had absolutely no pain or discomfort, and was only made aware that I needed a Root Canal when my regular Dentist had said so. I had waited about a month from this meeting, no pain or discomfort. I received Calcium Hydroxide treatment and had my next Root Canal treatment a month later. This entire period, I had no pain or discomfort. I never had any pain or discomfort the entire timespan this took place. \n\nNow, I come in for my Apicoectomy to a different Endodontist from the previously stated one, on recommendation of the previous one. It felt EXTREMELY rushed. The entire process took about 20-25 minutes. For reference, each Root Canal appointment took about 1 hour. Not even 10 seconds after applying numbing gel, the surgeon began poking me with Novacaine repeatedly. It legitimately made my eyes water from the discomfort. After waiting about 2-3 minutes, he began going to town on my gums and bone. Now, I have no idea what went on or what happened, but it felt like the entire time he was working, he was trying to just finish as quick as possible. Once he finished, he did not show me X-Rays or anything else, he simply gave some instructions regarding aftercare and took off. They did not give me antibiotics either. All of this felt off to me. \n\nI am now wondering if I should follow up with anyone and whether or not I could be in serious trouble in terms of my health. I do have scans of my tooth from pre-procedure (these were provided by the original Endodontist who did my CH and RCT treatments, not the one who did my Apicoectomy) and will DM them if requested.",

This is for a very close friend who's like a second mom to me.\n\nThey found in may a very large tumor (9cm) in her right kidney. She didn't have any symptoms other than a high blood pressure that lead to her PC ordering a scanner and that's when they found the tumor. They did a whole body scan and also found some \"small lesions\" (I'm not sure of the exact term used) in the head of her pancreas, but the word \"metastasis\" was never used. The glands and veins surrounding her kidney was tumor-free. Her left kidney is completely untouched. \n\nShe just had a kidney ablation yesterday, they took out her whole right kidney, the surgery lasted 3h through cealioscopy and surgeon said everything went perfect. They didn't touch the head of pancreas and said the \"lesions\" are really tiny and they will monitor them in the next few months to see if they evolve, in which case they will be doing something about it (what, I don't know).\n\nMy question is: what to expect now? The surgeon went to see her this morning after she woke up and said they will probably put her under \"medication\" soon, I saw some mixed infos on internet, does this \"treatment\" means she's gonna need immunotherapy or is it most likely be some sort of anti coagulant medication for after the surgery?\n\nDoes that means she's now cancer free, since they removed the organ that hosted the tumor (we don't know if the pancreas thing is linked to the kidney cancer or not)? What should we expect next? I know she will be supervised at least for the next five years to see any evolutions in her organs and see if the cancer comes back, but could someone explain what is most likely to happen to her now, and what her prognosis might be (even though I understand there is no way for you guys to give an accurate answer given that you haven't seen her medical record).  \n\n\nAny insight would be greatly appreciated.

I was drugged for most of it, probably some kind of pain killer or sedative. I was also often left with physical trauma and regularly had tearing and bleeding. \n\nWhen I was about 10 I got my period, but I thought it was just from my abuse, so I didn't realize. Thus, no one knew. When I was 11, I had (what I now know as an adult) a miscarriage by myself. I had no idea I was pregnant so I didn't tell anyone. Some people had started to comment on my stomach growing, making jokes about me getting fat and looking pregnant. But I had no sex education or knowledge at all of biology, so I was just confused. Anyway, I'll spare the details unless they are needed, but I passed a fetus and a LOT of blood and tissue. The fetus was kind of deformed and the color was kind of purple, the head still had a kind of lima bean shaped with black dots (?) for eyes. It had legs arms and the beginning of nubs for toes and fingers. It was about the size of my palm, maybe a little smaller. I am wondering if by that description anyone would be able to give an estimate for how far along I was? I bled pretty heavily for three days and just faked a stomach bug. \n\nMy next question has to do with my health now. I have VERY painful menstruation. It feels like blood just collects in my organs and feels like they are going to burst. The lighter my period is, the more it hurts. The only thing that's ever helped some us being on the birth control pill. I've had pelvic ultrasounds, and I do have ovarian cysts but no evidence of abnormal endometrial tissue. My hormone levels also suggested PCOS, so that is what they diagnosed me with. My obgyn also has commented that I have one of the smallest cervix openings she has ever seen. She was like visibly shocked the first time she examined me. \n\nAlso, the first time I had PIV sex as an adult (24 years old), my hymen was already broken and damaged from childhood, so there was no tearing there, but my vagina inside was like ..blocked? It took a while and a lot of force to actual get my inner vaginal cannal to open. It was not vaginismus, as I've experienced that. My muscles where very relaxed and it wasn't a lubrication problem. It was like an internal blockage. Once I finally got past it, there was almost like a popping sensation and a LOT of blood. But after that, no problems with PIV sex. \n\nOne other thing I should mention is I have memories of being hospitalized for a few days with some kind of vaginal injury as a kid, maybe 6 years old, I definitely had some kind of surgical procedure under anesthesia. I remember my parents telling the doctors it was due to a bike accident. Unfortunately, all of my medical records were wiped at the hospital so they can give me no information (long story).\n\nThanks for reading all of that. Does anyone have any feedback for me?

For anyone wondering, she basically said skin types are a myth (except for acne-prone and another type; but oily or dry or whatever else is just dependent on environmental factors) and moisturizers are a racket, and I should just stick with cerave, Cetaphil, or Neutrogena. \n\nAnyway, while I was there, I sort of mentioned in passing that I'd recently had trouble with swollen eyelids. It happened once on one eyelid and lasted about a day. I didn't know the cause. Then, it happened again to both eyelids with far greater severity and lasted about 3 days. This time, every environmental factor was different, because I was on vacation. The only thing the same was that I had done my nails the night before (something I never do and had just started doing for a string of weddings). After some googling, I figured it was irritant contact dermatitis. I went to the urgent care, and they gave me a corticosteroid shot which helped after about a day. Some time later, I was too lazy to wash my mascara off with face wash and used bathroom wipes, which noticeably dried my eyelid skin out, and the swelling came the next day. \n\nI explained this history to the dermatologist, and she said she could prescribe me a topical ointment for the next time it happens. So, she did. I picked it up and forgot about it. Well, now, about a year later, my eyelid is furiously swollen (just one this time). It started with a feeling like my eyelid was bruised on Monday night. Tuesday I woke up to swelling. Now it's Wednesday and the swelling is even worse. I don't even know what would have caused it this time. I'm stumped. But I suddenly remembered the ointment I was prescribed, so I went downstairs and found it. It's called Desonide ointment (low potency - ~0.05% I think). The label clearly states in large, bold font: AVOID CONTACT WITH EYES. \n\nObviously, the dermatologist who prescribed me this knew that the issue was with my eyelids, but she prescribed it nonetheless. So, am I correct in thinking it is fine for me to use this on my eyelids despite the warnings if I am careful not to let it get into my eyes? Or is it not worth the risk, and I should just take some ibuprofen and wait for the swelling to go down on its own? For what it's worth, I tried a warm compress last night before bed, and it doesn't seem to have helped. \n\nThanks in advance :(",

It happened really fast, like within 30 minutes most of everything passed. Bled and passed tissue for a few days then it cleared up. Had an ultrasound that was clear. I didn\u2019t get my period again until March, it was extremely heavy and had more clots than my normal but nothing bigger than a quarter and lasted 12 days. I mentioned it to the OB who said that my next few cycles might be abnormal, so I just carried on. My partner and I haven\u2019t had vaginal intercourse since my miscarriage. \n\n I\u2019ve had the same type of periods until mid June.

On and off for the last month I haven\u2019t had a true period and bleeding unpredictably and sometimes with clots that range from pencil eraser to penny sized. I\u2019ve been taking iron but I can tell I\u2019m still anemic.

I called again and was told this is normal and my hormones are probably just imbalanced. \n\nThis is affecting my energy, my mental health, my relationship and sex life. Is this really normal?

Also very high-arched palate. I suspect some seizure activity (absences), but we're on the waiting list to neuro.  \n\n\nMy younger son had genetic tests done. They checked epilepsy, ectodermal features and intellectual   \ndisabilities panels (https://nhsgms-panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/). Nothing came up.

The veins tend to look much thicker and larger during the end of the day than in the morning, and dehydration makes them pop out even further. In the pictures I provided it was late night and I wasn't particularly dehydrated.\n\nI do not have any existing relevant medical issues and I am not taking medication, but I drink occasionally. I also have a small burn mark on my left foot caused by hot oil. I believe that sodium is also a contributing factor to the appearance of these veins but I have been cutting my sodium instake in hopes that it will help a little bit to reduce the thickness. I did not consume much sodium at all on the day where I took these images.\n\nDoes this look like it could be serious? If so what should I do? I do not have varicose veins on my legs, only my feet and I do not have veinous insufficiency. The veins do not hurt either, they are just really unpleasant to look at. My father believes it's not a serious issue and likely just genetic, but I'm worried that it could potentially be more than a cosmetic issue as I have never seen veins this thick on feet before. \n\nI'm really desperate to know how to go about this, any thoughts?",

I assume I'm not squeamish/am good with blood, I remove bones from animal carcasses as a hobby, I've been fine in the past watching blood drawn, watching injections/stitches into deep wounds, etc. and I was fine when I left the surgery room but kept watching the surgery. \n\nFrom what I remember when I first went in I didn't last very long before I felt like I was gonna shit myself, realized my vision was going, and asked to step out for a bit. Sat in a chair and kept watching til I felt normal, then went back in. Then I lasted a little longer but eventually had to step back out again. Repeat x1, then I had to go do something else nearby, then I came back and that was probably the longest I lasted. I don't remember entirely what happened the first few times but I know when I was lasting longer, I would start yawning a lot at first and then several minutes later the nausea/I'm gonna shit myself/dizziness would start to kick in. My supervisor mentioned that sometimes people have issues with the air pressure difference in the OR. I did try to keep track of exactly how long I was lasting but there was a lot going on and I was dizzy so I don't know. \n\nI do probably have some issues with circulation that seem to hike up when I start menstruating, which was a few days ago for me, and at that time I can get really dizzy, I often lose feeling in my fingers for a bit. I asked my doctor about it and she thought I was anemic, so I had bloodwork done and I wasn't so it was \"lol see you next year.\"\n\nThe only times I've fainted/came close to fainting were likely due to blood loss from an injury a very long time back, after my COVID booster, a couple times near the start of menstruation.

It is currently 5.5\" larger than my left.  My butt/hip is 4\" larger than the left side.  The \"swelling\" is localized, does not affect anything below mid-thigh or above my hip.  I often have numbness and tingling, and occasional pain similar to a pulled muscle which doesn't last long.  I have tried lymphedema treatment (compression, exercises, massage, \"inflatable\" pants, etc.) with no improvement.  \n\nLymphedema and venous insufficiency were ruled out in June 2022 via lymphangiogram, which showed both systems to be in good condition, and described the lymph nodes as less than 1.1 cm.  Now, in July 2023, an US shows multiple enlarged lymph nodes, with the largest measuring 3.6 cm.  \n\nI have not been sick, I do not have STD's, the transvaginal US showed my reproductive system is healthy and functional.  I'd describe this condition as \"chronic\" and emphasize that it doesn't seem to be influenced by any sort of illness/trauma.\n\n**RADIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY FINDINGS** \n\n*8/20 CT FOR APPY* - Splenic calcified granulomas. New simple appearing cyst in the spleen posteriorly, 19 x 16 mm.  (Everything else was normal, aside from the appendicitis-related findings.)\n\n*3/21 US* - Focused sonography of the right groin in the patient's area of concern for lump demonstrates nodes measuring 0.9 x 0.7 x 1.5 cm, and 1.1 x 0.9 x 1.2 cm.  Prominent right inguinal lymph nodes.\n\n*4/21 Biopsy* - The excision demonstrates a benign, nonreactive lymph node. There are some focal vascular proliferation which could represent intranodal angiosis. A CD3 and CD20 favor a benign process.\n\n*6/22 MRA* - There appears to be very rapid early venous drainage of the injected radiotracer, with no significant lymphatic uptake delay and no evidence of a dilated lymphatic channel. Within the pelvis, specifically at the site of prior lymph node dissection/resection, there is no evidence of a lymphatic fracture and no evidence of delayed lymphatic uptake.  The study essentially demonstrates extensive venous uptake and contamination without evidence of lymph ectasia, lymphedema, or other lymphatic abnormality.\n\nThere are several benign/normal-appearing lymph nodes in the right inguinal region ranging in size from a few millimeters up to 1.1 cm. These are morphologically normal.\n\n*7/23 US* - Multiple enlarged lymph nodes. The largest lymph node is 3.6 cm in greatest dimension. No central necrosis at any of the lymph nodes. No abnormal fluid collection in the area of concern.  Right inguinal adenopathy. This may be reactive. Malignant adenopathy not excluded.\n\n\n**QUESTIONS**\n\nWhat is intranodal angiosis (in 4/21 biopsy)?  Blood vessels growing in to the lymph node caused the enlargement?  If so, why were they growing there?  Could intranodal angiosis be causing other nodes to swell in the same region?\n\nIs the spleen stuff of any concern relative to the lymph nodes swelling?  I was never informed of the spleen cyst, I just found it reading the report recently, so I assume it's not important.\n\nI understand that the US can't rule out malignancy, but can it detect malignancy?  Surely cancerous nodes have some distinct differences from healthy nodes to make them look 'scary', right? \n\nGiven the nearly 1 year time span between the MRA and the most recent US, is it of any use to the size of the lymph nodes from one to the other?  Or is it just, \"eh, a lot could happen in a year, lymph nodes change size all the time,\"  considering that mine seem to be ONLY increasing in size.  \n\nAny advice on where to go from here?  I'd like to avoid biopsy if at all possible.\n\n*ETA a timeline, incase it's helpful:*\n\n**TIMELINE:**\n\nJan 2020 - Swollen lymph node in hip\n\nAugust 2020 - CT and Appendectomy \n\nFebruary 2021 - Transvaginal US and STD test (all normal)\n\nMarch 2021 - US of lymph node, focused only on swollen node directly in the bend of hip\n\nApril 2021 - lymph node biopsy\n\nMay 2021 - sclerotherapy and drain placement to treat seroma/lymphocele\n\nAugust 2021 - upper thigh/hip swelling, suspected to be secondary lymphedema despite atypical presentation  (proximal, localized swelling)\n\nJune 2022 - MRA, lymphangiogram\n\nJuly 2023 - US of thigh",

I was so raw/red/my clitoral hood got smaller and I couldn\u2019t have anything touching the area. I only lasted 5 days of using. \n\nI had a follow up with her and she prescribed a lower dose steroid (started with a T) and said even if you don\u2019t have LS this shouldn\u2019t cause any problems. \n\nI waited a month for everything to settle down and applied the new steroid once and felt the same pain so never used again. \n\nI have since moved to Phoenix and have regular external sensitivity now which I never had before using the clobetosol. I have seen 3 different doctors here (OBs and Derm) and they all disagree with the LS diagnosis. \n\nI do have a partial clitoral adhesion, external sensitivity, clitoral sensitivity and still painful intercourse now. I made an appt with Dr. Irwin Goldstein in San Diego next month hoping he can help me. \n\nFor clitoral adhesions I have heard people getting lysis procedures but getting pudendal nueralgia from it, is that common? How else can you break up a clitoral adhesion safely? \n\nThank you!",

        "context": "Could it be cerebral palsy or something else (20F)?\nHi-- It's me again, I posted yesterday about toe walking and am following up because I received two distinct comments suggesting cerebral palsy as a possible explanation for my symptoms. I just want guidance on if it is worth bringing to a neurologist, because healthcare is expensive and I'm not sure if my university offers neurology as part of their clinic. I compiled a list, by no means exhaustive, of my symptoms and would love to have some feedback.\n\n**Background:**\n\nFirst things first, I was born premature and was in the N-ICU for some time (I think a few days to a week, I will verify). I was due mid-February (2003) but was born mid-January, 25 days early. My mom dealt with pre-eclampsia and was a high-risk pregnancy. Apparently, I came out purple, though I do not like to think about it too much. The following symptoms have been lifelong for me, though they tend to be worsened by other factors such as not getting enough sleep. My younger sisters (twins, born 2005) were an even higher risk pregnancy that left my mom bedridden for the third trimester. The doctors were concerned one of them would have cerebral palsy, and they were born very prematurely, spending the first few years of their life in OT and PT. Neither sister went on to have any lasting conditions, thankfully, and are happy, healthy, athletic, teenagers today. My sisters were born only two years after me, but they were born in the States and I was born in the Netherlands, meaning there was an entirely different team of doctors and an entirely different hospital, and maybe even protocol/perspective.\n\n**Obligatory Information:**\n\n20F, 145lbs, 5'7, Lamictal and Concerta (haven't taken in a while because of summer), ADHD, OCD, bp II, cough-induced asthma. Was in the ICU for a few days back in 2015 due to double bacterial pneumonia.\n\n**Coordination and Balance:**\n\nI've always felt like my limbs are just a little bit too long for my body and that my brain's mapping of them stopped a couple of inches early. I am frequently banging into things, hitting door frames, edges of tables, tripping over my feet, etc. It makes some things, like doing my hair, very hard as I do not have the dexterity. I also find that I will often break or rip things when I am just trying to gently handle them. For example, toast. I'll try to butter it and end up with my knife slipping through the bread. I drop things all of the time, multiple times a day including my phone, pens, pencils. Sometimes it's because I am holding them and my hand hits my thigh when I am walking, other times they just literally fall out of my hands.\n\nI  struggled with sports as well, despite how much I tried. I ran track for all four years of high school, which meant 1.5 hours of practice each weekday. We did weight and strength training, both bodyweight and with machines, as well as cardio. Despite how much I trained, I found that I wasn't building the same muscle mass as my peers and that I wasn't improving. I kept with it though, because the exercise was good for my mind and soul. There were times in gym class where I struggled with very basic tasks, like kicking a soccer ball under a foldable table. I couldn't even do that right. It hit the edge of the table and bounced back at me, and when I tried to kick it again, my foot missed! It was always attributed to me not trying hard enough, and I guess sometimes I would pretend that I didn't care, when really I did, because it is easier to attribute my brutal unathleticism to apathy rather than inability, especially because it came so easy to my peers.\n\nI have also taken two dance classes in college, and both of them were frustrating for not only me, but the instructor and whoever I was dancing with. I understood the dances and the steps conceptually, but I just couldn't get it right when the time came to actually execute the moves. I would trip over my feet, step on my partner's toes, mix up my lefts and rights, etc. I showed up every single class, but couldn't manage to get an A- one of the only people in the grade distribution to have not.\n\nI sprained my ankle during one of the dance classes, and a week later sprained it the other way which landed me in a boot for three weeks. When the doctor looked at it, he also mentioned that I have ligament laxity.\n\n**Toe Walking:**\n\nI have walked on my toes since I was a child. Though the issue has seemed to correct itself when I am wearing shoes, the moment that I am barefoot I am on my toes. I think it has impacted me in more ways than once thought, as I cannot even do a basic squat with my feet flat on the ground.\n\n**Cognitive:**\n\nGrowing up, I was very sensitive and learned to worry as soon as I learned how to think. I was, and am, very spacey and was diagnosed with ADHD-C around age 16, though my teachers suggested it could be a possibility years and years and years before. I don't want to get into why it wasn't addressed, but a lot of health concerns were not addressed when I was a child-- I was kind of the \"rub some dirt on it you'll be fine\" kid. I struggle with extreme mood swings and panic attacks as well as OCD. I also have a huge startle reflex which is kind of embarrassing, but I always attributed it to being \"wound up\" and anxious all of the time. But there have been times when, say, a door slams, for example, and I am the only one in the room with a reaction, a reaction where I nearly jump out of my seat. Cognitively, I never felt behind in my understanding of concepts but I find them difficult to verbalize, which is why writing is my saving grace. I really struggled in school, but that was more because I was picked on for being somewhat eccentric.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI know that these things are impossible to diagnose over the internet, but some clarity and guidance would be much appreciated. I think that I am just frustrated and tired and looking for answers so I can live my best, healthiest, life. I for sure want to correct my toe walking so it doesn't become a problem later on, and beyond that, I would like to find the cause if there is any. Thank you so much for your time in reading this, and I hope that you have a splendid day!",

My sons father also briefly was diagnosed with diabetes, but his was caused by a medication side effect, and since stopping that med, his glucose levels have normalized again and he no longer meets criteria for diagnosis. \n\nMy son has been gaining weight rapidly for the past 6 months and has probably put on 10-15lbs. He is constantly hungry and thirsty. I have tried adjusting the snack foods we keep in the house so he has better options, but he is just constantly going to the fridge or pantry. I have to keep him busy or out of the house to keep him from bored eating. \n\nOn top of that, he excessively sweats. In even mildly warm Temps, he turns beat red and is dripping sweat. He has also started bedwetting and has NEVER done that before, even when potty training. \n\nI would like to bring it up at his next well child visit in August, but my biggest concern is going to be bloodwork. With his sensory issues, we cannot even do standard vaccines without him having a meltdown and taking multiple people to hold him still.

My hemorrhoid is not too painful and not bleeding but have that pressure/discomfort right at the bottom.\n\nOn top of this, I am recently  experiencing some bloating and gas after eating food. I also feel like I have been releasing some gas (flatulence) on and off while sitting after eating. I asked my doctor and he said the sphincter muscle would not be fully closed considering you have internal hemorrhoid and that's why you feel like you are releasing gas.\n\nI have never had this issue before and this is concerning.

I have GAD, clinical depression and dealing with light cross contamination ocd, intrusive thoughts as well as depersonalisation episodes. It\u2019s a lot to take on (imo) but I find that I deal with it relatively well and would be classified as a \u2018high functioning\u2019 patient. I do have low energy constantly but I fight with it as much as I can. Up to 2 months ago I had a full time job and did well at it.\n\nHOWEVER I don\u2019t like the side effects of my medication. My main problem is an extremely low sex drive. To the point I just don\u2019t need sex at the moment. I have a long time partner who I love and want us to be happy in all aspects of the relationship so you understand why I would want to get off my medication. Just to add - this is not the only reason I want to quit Venlafaxine. I am overall sick and tired of working all my day and time around it, worrying whether I will feel sick and dizzy if I take it an hour late or if I will feel drowsy and sick after taking it. I also don\u2019t want to keep taking it in order to avoid any heart problems I\u2019ve heard are connected to long term use of it.\n\nNow to the main question - how can I safely quit it or taper off?\nI am currently in a country where I don\u2019t have a medical insurance and I can\u2019t afford it so I can\u2019t consult a gp. I am in this country, though, as I have family here and I feel the safest around them. In a country where I normally work and live I was refused free therapy as I am too high functioning. When I could afford it, I had several paid therapy sessions  but felt my needs weren\u2019t met and I was misunderstood. I take the lowest possible dose so I can\u2019t even gradually lower it so wondering if there are other ways to taper off safely and not too abruptly. \nLast thing - I don\u2019t really have suicidal thoughts but if my dose is late, I tend to have low mood and I can see how it sometimes could lead me to thoughts of just disappearing.",

For example a large mall or grocery store or any room with tall ceilings would make me feel dizzy and lightheaded and start making things feel like they were fake. I did go to my doctor, but was told it was from anxiety(which I don\u2019t have a history of). I also developed horrible headaches on the right side of my head above my ear which have decreased as time has gone on. \n\nSome other symptoms that I have and have gotten worse as time goes on is brain fog where I can\u2019t finish a sentence and completely lose track of where I am in the sentence, Deja Vu which has increased to weekly now. Also 3 times this has happened to me where I smell things that aren\u2019t there such as rotten eggs, burning oil, and then after a few minutes the smell changes to maple syrup and then goes away after 5 minutes. \n\nMy primary doctor insists this is just anxiety and only ordered blood tests on me and told me to see a therapist which I have for 5 months now without very much change in symptoms other than they aren\u2019t freaking me out as much.\n\nMy main question is could my symptoms be a sign of something more serious or perhaps just an anxiety disorder? No one in my family has any history of an anxiety disorder and no one has a history of brain issues as well. I just wanted to look for opinions because this is really bothering me. Thanks!",

GP referred me for a colonoscopy just in case to rule out early IBD.\n\nBefore I could get the colonoscopy (long queues) I got very ill at the end of June with bloody diarrhea, 38,5+ fever and abdominal pain. As my CRP was at 200+ and CT showed pancolitis I was admitted to the hospital, treated with IV antibiotics and a stool sample showed campylobacter. Once my CRP was lower I got discharged, but after 2 days was back at square one with similar symptoms, once again admitted and treated with IV antibiotics.\n\nHowever this time no bacteria were found either in my stool nor my blood. After a week of treatment my CRP was at 20ish and I got discharged again......only to be ill one week later with very high fever 39+, again elevated CRP at 190, lower left abdominal pain and some loose stools. Repeated CT showed colitis in my left colon and a colonoscopy was scheduled promptly. Again treated with IV antibiotics, which again, improved my CRP.\n\nThe colonoscopy showed segemental, well defined and non-bleeding ulcerations and reddening/thickening of the colon from my transverse to my sigmoid colon (most heavy inflammation in left descending and sigmoid) and based on the visuals alone the doctors couldn't determine if it was Crohn's or ulcerations due to infection. All other areas (rectum, right colon, cecum etc where without any pathological changes). They took biopsies of the inflamed areas, and while during the wait for the results I got prednisone 40mg/ day.\n\nOn the day I received the results that the biopsies showed that the inflammation was clearly due to infection and no signs of IBD were seen my CRP was 7 and I was discharged from the hospital. At this point, both antibiotics (1 week course) and prednisone was discontinued.\n\nNow one week has gone since I've been discharged and on my follow up my CRP has risen back to 44. So far I have no fever and bowel movements are better (somewhat formed). The infectious disease doc is however starting to mention IBD again - which has me worried because I thought that the biopsies ruled it out.\n\nHence my question: Is it possible that the biopsies missed Crohn's and are a false negative?\n\nThanks",

I did go to school for occupational therapy assistant, so I have some knowledge, but mainly enough to tell him he needs to go see a doctor. He doesn't want to go to one until Monday to see how it heals...\n\nOn Sunday my husband (28 Male) was moving a mattress, mostly by himself. His left arm was under the mattress supporting it when it fell over and he tried to catch it. His elbow hyperextended.  He said that he heard 3 loud pops, followed by a lot of pain. There has not been any swelling or bruising. \n\nI saw him about 5 hours after the injury. He could supinate his arm, but could not pronate without significant pain/tightness. I finally convinced him to use a heating pad on the area and he can supinate somewhat, enough to wash his hands about 48 hours after the injury. \n\nHe has full elbow flexion with no/minimal pain. His becep does bother him somewhat when he fully contracts it. He also reports pain on the medial side of his elbow. \n\nHe has full movement of his fingers, but he cannot turn a key. Grasping items does not hurt. \n\nThe movement that causes him the most pain is trying to flex while his arm is pronated. Like if he was riding a horse, he could not pull up on the reigns, if that makes sense. The pain still limits his ROM. \n\nMy husband LOVES working out and he has rather significant muscles in his arms. I'm trying tell him that he needs to see a doctor so that we can know what's wrong and work on a plan so he can work out again ASAP, but he wants to wait for a few more days. \n\nAny idea of what this could possibly be? My husband is very healthy, doesn't smoke, rarely drinks, physically fit, no medication, no relevant medical history.",

The surgeon noted that it looked like the stone they removed had been forming for a long time (I first started having symptoms as long as 2.5-3 yrs ago but didn\u2019t go to the hospital until about 1.5 months ago) and it had caused partial kidney failure in my right kidney. The CT scans that they took showed significant thinning of the lining of my right kidney. \n\nThe stent was placed during the same procedure. Ever since waking up from the anesthesia, I have been in severe pain. The first night, the pain was worse than the pain I had experienced from the kidney stone (which is what prompted me to go to the hospital 1.5 months ago.) since then, the pain has gotten a bit better, but none of the medications they gave me seem to be helping. \n\n**The medications are:**\n\nacetaminophen 500mg\n\nCephalexin 500mg\n\nPhenazopyridine 200mg\n\nOxybutinin 5mg\n\nIbuprofen 400mg\n\nTamsulosin 0.4mg \n\nI went to the hospital (different one than the one that did the surgery) tonight out of precaution because my right hand was swelling (same side that they preformed surgery on) and I read that this could be a sign of kidney failure. I felt that they weren\u2019t understanding what I was saying, and thought that I was concerned about injury to my hand. They took x rays of my hand and I felt like this was all rather pointless (I have a *severe* phobia of hospitals so I was already extremely on edge). I ended up having an anxiety attack and left AMA. \n\nIn my state of panic, I forgot to have them remove the IV thing in my arm (not sure what it\u2019s called, it has 2 port things which are in a v shape.

Described in the report as \"left distal pretibial region.\" I've had it for around 2 years and I haven't noticed any changes during that time. It is a relatively hard little something underneath the skin. It does not hurt or have any tenderness, it can move around a bit, the skin above it appears normal, just raised.\n\nI went to a dermatologist to get it checked out and they were not very concerned, thinking it could be a calcium deposit, but after some time recommended excision just to be safe.\n\nIt was excised 8 days ago now. It seemed to me that it was fixed to something so the procedure took a bit long, my guess is that it was fixed to the layer of skin above it? They got it removed and it was maybe around the size of a kernel of corn? A bit smaller than that maybe. Smaller than a pea for sure. Bigger than a grain of rice. The report lists \"neoplasm of uncertain behavior\" which I understand to be a relatively useless term at this stage of the process. It also says \"Depth of Biopsy - adipose tissue\"\n\nThe doctor told me prior to the procedure that she would put a rush on the biopsy since she could tell I was very anxious about it.\n\nI can see in the report that they are doing \"H and E\" staining which I understand to be relatively standard, but 6 days after the excision they called me and told me the results would be delayed because they need to do \"additional stains\" on the sample. I was quite worried by this because it seems to me that if it was a simple benign tumor there probably wouldn't be the need for more stains, so I feel like my odds of having a malignancy have just shot up and I am feeling extremely anxious.\n\nCan someone add some color to the situation and maybe talk me off the anxiety ledge here? How likely is it for a tumor that small in that area to be a real concern? Are we looking at like a 5% chance I could have cancer or something more like 50+%?",

The lump stopped protruding after a few days, but when I lay down on my left side it becomes very prominent. The day after, I developed a pain on the inside of my neck whenever I swallow. There are also two small dark patches on the front of my neck which I first noticed a month ago. They resemble a bruise or healed burn but I did not sustain any injuries to my neck.\n\n\nI visited a doctor with other symptoms two days after the neck pain began (namely: migraine, stuffy dry nose, fluid dripping out of my nose when head is bowed, cough, fatigue, and the lump), had my nostrils examined and was given a prescription for mometasone nasal spray. I used the spray but it did not offer any sinus relief, though my symptoms gradually got better (which I don\u2019t think was because of the spray). I suffered from night sweats and my migraine turned into a headache that felt like my head would implode for a few days during the recovery process. About 3 days ago the left side of my waist has also begun hurting whenever I cough or bend/twist. The spot is where my kidney would be and it *feels* like tendon/ligament pain (compared to muscle pain, stabbing pain etc).\n\n\nToday all that is left are the symptoms on my neck and coughing, but I still struggle with night sweats every other night (had it maybe twice in my life prior to this). I got a covid booster and flu shot about 20 days ago, a few weeks after my iron infusion in early June. From those blood tests, I also know I have a below average WBC count. I am worried because the day I landed overseas (back in early May), I suffered from the exact same symptoms as the bout of sickness I recently went through. The symptoms stopped when I arrived back home (12 days total). There are no patterns for when I begin getting sick, and it is not contagious (shared hotel rooms and tour bus seats with two family members 24/7 and they did not get sick). \n\n\nI have read about CSF leaks but highly doubt I have one. I just can\u2019t imagine what other sickness this could be? Especially since I have no history of allergies or sinus issues and it is the middle of winter here in Sydney. Should I see another doctor even though most of my symptoms have resolved?",

I know they tested my renal function, liver function and another marker I'm not sure what it was (possibly PET / PETR as mentioned below). \n\nOn my notes it just says \"please take pet bloods again, raised PETR - 46\". I've tried to Google this, no luck. Can anyone explain to me what this is? Is it just raised or very high marker?

My entire life up to that point, I pooped once every two to three days, and according to my doctors before then, that was just what was normal for me. I wasn't constipated - when I felt the need to go, I did, and there was no problem, the poop looked normal, it wasn't painful, didn't feel blocked, etc. In 2013, I suddenly started to need to poop every day (which I realize is the norm for most people).  \nThis was at the same point that I felt a kind of distant pain behind my belly button, which also coincided with a change in ejaculation. Previous to that point, I had always ejaculated a significant amount, and fairly long distances. With the distant pain and the change in pooping, the amount of ejaculate significantly lessened, and there was no longer any \"shooting.\" The feeling was much less intense, and frankly not as pleasurable as it had been. This is where it has been ever since. The pain eventually disappeared, and has not reoccurred. About a year before all of this, I started experiencing reflux - no clue if that's related at all. I was not on any medication at that time, other than popping famotidine for the reflux.  \nI went to my doctor at the time with all of this, an older dude who was totally checked out and ready to retire, he didn't seem interested and didn't ask me many questions or seem to think anything was amiss.

Described in the report as \"left distal pretibial region.\" I've had it for around 2 years and I haven't noticed any changes during that time. It is a relatively hard little something underneath the skin. It does not hurt or have any tenderness, it can move around a bit, the skin above it appears normal, just raised.\n\nI went to a dermatologist to get it checked out and they were not very concerned, thinking it could be a calcium deposit, but after some time recommended excision just to be safe.\n\nIt was excised 8 days ago now. It seemed to me that it was fixed to something so the procedure took a bit long, my guess is that it was fixed to the layer of skin above it? They got it removed and it was maybe around the size of a kernel of corn? A bit smaller than that maybe. Smaller than a pea for sure. Bigger than a grain of rice. The report lists \"neoplasm of uncertain behavior\" which I understand to be a relatively useless term at this stage of the process. It also says \"Depth of Biopsy - adipose tissue\"\n\nThe doctor told me prior to the procedure that she would put a rush on the biopsy since she could tell I was very anxious about it.\n\nI can see in the report that they are doing \"H and E\" staining which I understand to be relatively standard, but 6 days after the excision they called me and told me the results would be delayed because they need to do \"additional stains\" on the sample. I was quite worried by this because it seems to me that if it was a simple benign tumor there probably wouldn't be the need for more stains, so I feel like my odds of having a malignancy have just shot up and I am feeling extremely anxious.\n\nCan someone add some color to the situation and maybe talk me off the anxiety ledge here? How likely is it for a tumor that small in that area to be a real concern? Are we looking at like a 5% chance I could have cancer or something more like 50+%?",

I was coughing up yellow/green phlegm that following week, and was trying to dial it down but the intensity of the sheriff academy, my pride, and pushy instructors who don't \"allow you\" to be sick got the better of me, and I trained through it. Over the next few week I felt off but generally okay, all symptoms had subsided except I was coughing up green phlegm still, and I felt like I was operating at 70% capacity. I was still running 7-9 Miles at a 7 Minute flat pace, but I felt terrible doing it. At this time I was living in barracks housing, which was old, dirty, and there was mold present in some areas. \n\nFast forward a few weeks, I choose to remove myself from the academy for a variety of reasons, my wife and daughter needed me at home, my daughter is autistic and being away for weeks at a time was too hard on her, I was still sick, and ultimately I felt the job wasn't for me. Still coughing up green phlegm on Jun 26th I went to urgent care. The Physician I saw said I probably have bronchitis and prescribed the following:\n\ndoxycycline (MONODOX) 100 MG capsule (2 a day for 10 days)\r  \nalbuterol 108 (90 Base) MCG/ACT inhaler\r  \nmethylprednisolone (MEDROL DOSEPACK) 4 MG tablet (6-5-4-3-2-1 daily doses)\n\nI took 9 days worth of the antibiotic, but it was making me feel worse, and I skipped the last dose the 10th day. I took the steroid, as directed, with the exception of one day where I missed one of the four doses. \n\nAfter all that, I developed bad sinus pressure and nasal congestion, and the chest congestion was still present. I don't have the urge to cough, but when I exhale hard and deep, or \"Huff\" I can hear the crackling and can cough up the green mucus. Usually by the afternoon I feel halfway decent and most of my congestion has eased. But the next day I start all over again; plugged nose, green mucus, chest congestion, face pressure. I live at elevation and when I drive down the hill for work I get plugged up, ear pain, and sinus pressure. OTC stuff doesn't seem to help.\n\nI went back to the same urgent care on 7/14, the PA who saw me essentially told me to continue waiting it out, was very dismissive of me, and reluctantly ordered chest and sinus X-Rays of which I am still awaiting results.\n\nUltimately, as of today I am still sick, closing in on 40 days straight of CRAP! I have never been sick for this long in my entire life. Am I overthinking it? Do I just keep waiting? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nANY ADVICE IS GREATLY APPRECIATED, and I will promptly answer any questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks\n\n&#x200B;",

I heard and felt a popping or cracking noise, what sounded like two separate ones. It swelled immediately and I couldn't bear weight on that side of my foot without pain. At first I took it to be a bad ankle sprain and intended self-care only - R.I.C.E. basically (in retrospect probably silly considering both how bad it was and the noise). But 3 days later I decided to go to ER and got x-rays. The ER doctor told me I had two breaks, one ankle and one foot (fifth metatarsal I now know) and that both should heal well on their own. I left with crutches and picked up an aircast boot as instructed, and was told to stay off of it until seen by the orthopaedic surgeon at the fracture clinic who would contact me.\n\nI saw the surgeon a week later and he basically just said I could walk on the aircast boot and gradually wean out of it over 6-8 weeks as I was able. Both he and my family GP whom I had spoken to on the phone a few days prior said that only my metatarsal appeared fractured when I asked about the ankle.  He didn't assess or comment on the ankle (or anything else) any further and I left it at that, being focused on just dealing with my first broken bone.\n\nFast forward to today, I feel confident that my foot fracture has been healing steadily, I only feel the occasional tenderness there if anything at all.   I started gradually switching from the boot to good quality runners (which I wear in the house also) a few weeks ago and now don't really use the boot anymore.  However, my ankle is still swollen to varying degrees from barely noticeable to quite a bit, seemingly aggravated I think by being on my feet but not yet sure that's the trigger. This swelling comes on around my whole ankle, both sides and above and below. Also, my foot is sometimes very noticeably discolored compared to the other one, usually darker and reddish, once or twice it's been a bit paler.  I'm not sure yet what brings that on either.\n\nI'm seeing my family doc in person for the first time Thursday, the point of that visit being just to confirm my return to work the following week. But I'm starting to worry (ok, and sometimes work myself into enough of a panic to post on reddit) that I should have gotten this ankle properly looked at and there's something more problematic going on.  Would be extremely appreciative for any opinion whether I should be pushing for some sort of further imaging or assessment, or whether I can stay the course and consider this relatively 'normal' healing.  Thanks very much in advance for any input.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/MxZRDl1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/MxZRDl1.jpg)\n\nPhoto of swelling this evening. It is often much less than this, but also sometimes worse.

At first I was pretty concerned about it but after realizing it really was probably just the heat, I hadn't thought much of it and even felt normal for a few days. These attacks and feelings however quickly came back up and had been happening daily to varying severity.

Or just something somatic?\nF28, 160 cm, 70 kg\n\nMedication: 2x20mg omeprazole, 1 one billion unit probiotic, and 3x60 mg alverine and simethicone daily for a colitis flareup (prescribed for a month, I\u2019m starting the third week), plus 1x500 mg extended release metformin, 2 myo-inositol, 1 vitamin D supplement daily, and .025mg cabergoline weekly to treat PCOS and elevated prolactin levels (prescribed for three months before checkup, also starting the third week) \n\nOn January I went to a GP about another colitis flareup, my main symptoms were bloating and starting to feel some fatigue. The GP only did a physical checkup, didn\u2019t ask for blood tests or other analysis. I complained mostly about pain/discomfort on my right side, right under the ribcage, and she told me she was ruling out liver problems on the basis alone that the pain didn\u2019t worsen in the area while she was feeling around. She prescribed me a week-long treatment and I felt a lot better.\r\n\nAround May I began experiencing a lot of stress and noticed I began bloating again, but due to financial problems I could only ignore it. It worsened with time, albeit slightly, and just at the beginning of July I was able to invest in getting checkups again.\r\n\nI started with a gynecologist due to some discomfort on my breasts, which to be honest caused me to panic and stress even more over the fear of it being breast cancer, but after an ultrasound and blood test, the doctor explained it was only an increase on my prolactin levels, a vitamin D deficiency and a couple of hormones having inverted values, as well as my insulin resistance flaring up again. I must admit I spent almost everyday at home until very recently, and my diet is/was not the best, so the vitamin D deficiency didn\u2019t really come as a surprise (from a baseline of =<30, I had 9.43). Still, the almost three-week waiting period raised up hell in my already uncomfortable gut.\r\n\nI took those blood work results to a gastroenterologist in case they were useful to her, since I read that vitamin D and prolactin are metabolized through the liver, but she disregarded them quickly. My symptoms were the same as the ones in January: I was uncomfortably bloated, spicy and greasy foods, which I had been honestly abusing lately, weren\u2019t sitting right with me and I had occasional diarrhea, although with no blood on sight. I also felt discomfort on my right side, right under my ribcage, again. During the physical checkup she also semi-ruled out liver problems, but still asked for a liver and bile duct ultrasound and a 32-element blood work to make sure.\r\n\nThe ultrasound report says: \"Moderate grade fatty liver, cholelithiasis without bile duct dilation\", and recommended to check certain values, which are as follows (I\u2019ll include the lab baseline values in parenthesis next to my values, since I live outside the USA and don\u2019t know if they vary):\r  \nAlbumin: 4.80 (3.97-4.94)\r  \nAlkaline phosphatase: 75.1 (35.0-104.0)\r  \nBilirubin: 0.57 (<=1.20)\r  \nALT: 32.9 (<=33.0)\r  \nAST: 21.9 (<=32.0)\r  \nGGT: 16.4 (<=40.0)\r  \nThe ultrasound also recommended to check TP, TPT and prothrombin time, but my initial blood work didn\u2019t include it.\r\n\nThe gastroenterologist said she would let me know if it was necessary to go see her earlier when I sent my results, otherwise she would see me in a month. She only confirmed she had received my blood work and ultrasounds and didn\u2019t add anything else, so I\u2019m assuming I\u2019ll see her at the beginning of August.\r\n\nNow, starting on the third week of all the medicine I have to take, I\u2019ve noticed only small changes: I\u2019m not as bloated, but I\u2019m still bloated. I\u2019m not really feeling hungry (but I have to admit, I\u2019m also a very anxious person and normally during elevated anxiety periods I lose appetite completely). I burp after eating anything, no matter how little it is (for example, I burped after having two peach gummies the other day). My bowel movements go from slight constipation to slight diarrhea and they are consistently a soft brown color (I wouldn\u2019t call it clay-colored, but it\u2019s definitely lighter than my normal bowel movements). The general discomfort under my right ribcage has improved considerably, although when I get nervous/anxious I feel it. But now, every now and then, I feel little, very defined stabby pains in that area, instead of just general discomfort/ache. I would describe them as someone poking me with a sharp object. The pain lasts a few seconds at most and then goes away, but it leaves me scared. I\u2019m also sometimes dizzy and slightly nauseous, but haven\u2019t really thrown up during the treatment (and even before that, in a long time).\r\n\nNow, the thing is I don\u2019t know if these could be gallbladder attacks or the fatty liver acting up. Even if I go to sleep feeling those discomforts, I always wake up without them. Sometimes symptoms start shortly after waking up, but I\u2019ve noticed that happens only on days when I\u2019m feeling overtly-anxious and obsessively scanning my body. I can exercise without a problem and I\u2019ve noticed that even improves my overall perceived state. Still no blood on sight in my stool, and no traces of jaundice in my skin or eyes, although my eyes have also been very dry and kinda bloodshot, if that could be relevant?\r\n\nCould someone give me an insight of what could be happening? I must admit, again, that I have horrible health anxiety, so my fears range from gallstone attacks, to liver problems, to some sort of cancer (no other reason other than some blood values being so high while others are normal, though I admit I know nothing about it so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s truly an indication of something being severely wrong), so I don\u2019t know if I should go see another gastroenterologist sooner and push for an endoscopy/colonoscopy/something of the sort right now, or just wait a couple weeks more to see what my doc has to say. I\u2019d appreciate any comment.\r  \n",

Seems reasonable  but my friend, who lives in Atlantic Canada (I'm on the west coast in BC) where ticks are super plentiful this time of year, asked me if I was sure it isn't a tick bite...I definitely don't recall seeing a tick, and it doesn't seem to have this \"bullseye\" appearance , but I guess it's possible! \ud83e\udeb2",

I am male, 35 years old, white, average height and build, no significant past medical history. \n\nYesterday I engaged in consensual BDSM sex for the first time. Something unexpected happened, in that my partner bit down on my penis mid-shaft and roughly squeezed my left testicle. This was startling and painful, but we were both more shocked by the small drop of blood that immediately appeared from my urethral meatus. We stopped, and I took the opportunity to go and empty my bladder. I kept my pants on the rest of the night, we made no further attempts to engage in oral sex nor any penetrative sex. \n\nI've seen no more blood since that initial single drop, not last night nor at all today, and it has not been painful to urinate today (last night it was just a bit sensitive the first time). On my penis, there's no swelling, redness, bruising or any other visible mark, no pain on urination, maybe the faintest general discomfort sort of localised towards the tip. My left testicle feels a bit tender and could be a little larger, or it might just be in my head, if it is swollen it is certainly subtle (my partner didn't know this but my left testicle has been aching on and off for over a year, for which my GP prescribed \"watch and wait\"). I haven't tried to get erect since last night so I don't know if that would cause any pain. \n\nThis has all been somewhat mortifying. Obviously the safe answer is \"go see a doctor\". I'd rather not, especially not if it will just be a wasted trip where they say \"you look fine, no obvious signs/symptoms, come back if it gets worse\". Not that it should matter, but I know it does - I'm in the UK, on the NHS. Is it fine to just skip the humiliation of a first trip and only go if anything changes? Or is there something I don't know about this kind of small injury that could come back to \"bite\" me later?",

Epilepsy trigerred by painful menstruation (definitely adenomyosis, probably endometriosis too)\nor sleep lower than 6 hrs\n\n4. I sometimes suddenly wake up at night and feel dizzy. My heart also beat so fast. I think that I will have an epileptic attack when i experience this.\n\n5. I have GERD. Experience post nasal drip. Difficulty talking for long periods of time which makes it difficult to teach.\n\n6. Painful legs and feet almost everyday.

I also easily get cramps to the extent that I couldn't walk sometimes, even if I just sit down for 30 mins.\nMy back also hurts sometimes to the point that I couldnt wake up.\n\n7. Preliminary assessment is I have ADD (without the H in adhd cause i don't have energy), little bit of OCD, and low spatial intelligence. With this, I have difficulty studying (and so other tasks). It would take me about 20 mins to finish 1 page. It depends with the font, it could even take an hour. In a word (esp those used in science and med), I can only remember the 1st and last syllables.

I really do my very best to improve my habits but I really can't wake-up.)\n\nMy activities: taking up masters (online only about 5 hours a week), teaching undergrad classes part-time (14 hours a week only) , doing online writing jobs (almost every evening)\n\nHow can I solve these?

My diet is incredibly poor, lots of high sodium\u2019s and processed foods. \n\nConsidering I have no real frame of reference on what to look out for when it comes to blood sugar or blood pressure related issues, I just am curious as to what to keep an eye out for and when, if it ever, can be serious?",

        "context": "Resources for understanding late/end-stage COPD symptom progression\nHi. My father (74M) is currently hospitalized due to late or end-stage COPD. Following an ER visit for breathing difficulties nearly 2 months ago, he was diagnosed with MRSA in his blood and pneumonia. He was placed on a ventilator and then had to have a tracheostomy shortly thereafter. He has been weaned from the ventilator by some miracle and is no longer on antibiotics, but is still trached and has a stomach-placed feeding tube.  \n\nWhile his care team has been great, I am getting conflicting information about how symptoms will progress. Some nurses he sees day to day have told me how he will continue to deteriorate from here, but the \"main\" family-facing care managers and head nurses are not so straightforward. They keep it very vague and are sometimes, I think, optimistic so as not to upset us. I am looking for resources or explanations that are in-depth and describe what to expect \\*realistically\\* as his disease continues to progress and how it will affect his body and mind. \n\nToday he told me he had vivid and terrifying hallucinations during the night and into the morning. His respiratory nurse told me that may be due to high Co2 buildup, which is understandable. I'd like to know what is in store for him as he continues to live out the disease so I can know what to begin to expect. When I look online, I see similarly vague and positive-leaning resources that seem geared toward making patients and their loved ones remaining hopeful about recovery. Medical papers, forums, first-hand knowledge, even teaching materials are all welcome and the type of resource I'm looking for. \n\nThanks. ",

        "context": "im scared to sleep now, i think im having tics in my sleep or developed a new tic? is this a tic?\nF17\n\nEver since this morning I\u2019ve been afraid about going to sleep after what happened. I don\u2019t want it to happen again, it really scared and freaked me out. \n\n\nI was diagnosed with tic disorder in late spring of 2020 which I had just started my teens at the time. I have more tics some days than others, but they especially flare up outside my home because I have bad social phobia/anxiety. \n\nSince the beginning of this summer my tics have just been getting worse. Like I said they happen more some days then others but it\u2019s just at a constant now. But that\u2019s not what I was scared about, it\u2019s a little weird that my tics are flaring up for no reason but I mean it\u2019s not that much of a uncommon thing from what I know.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain. The past few nights I wake up in a half conscious/asleep state jolting and almost immediately fall back to sleep within seconds. (Which isn\u2019t abnormal in general for anyone. Except I never jolted like this when half conscious/asleep.) But not as much as this, like back to back all night every few minutes these past few nights. I didn\u2019t think much about it because I thought it was just because of me being uncomfortable or just having trouble sleeping. Around 4am this morning it happened again but this time when I woke up I gasped jolted while still laying on my side unable to breathe or move while feeling nauseous having a tic. I close my eyes letting out a strong exhale from being unable to breathe then everything went black. Same thing happened again and again. But the more it happened I became more conscious/not half asleep and things wouldn\u2019t go black immediately after closing my eyes. \n\nThe last time I woke up (haven\u2019t been back asleep since) and it happened and didn\u2019t stop. I had a tic attack(?) for over a hour. Along with that I would just blank out while it happened at some points, only a little though. I cant tell if it was me falling asleep or just kinda, I don\u2019t know blanking out? They just wouldn\u2019t stop and I could hardly breathe. I was able to exhale and catch a quick breathe if it was a in between. The more it happened the more nauseous I felt and panting from trying to catch a breath made it worse. And half of the tics weren\u2019t quick jerks like the ones I usually have. Half of them were like a jerk then freeze while feeling like I\u2019m stretching my body out along with shaking sometimes spasming unable to breathe, then after maybe 10-15 seconds (there was a mix of how long it lasted some were shorter and some were longer) my body would relax/unfreeze then I\u2019d exhale and it happens again after or a few seconds after. Some didn\u2019t even allow me to catch and breath after exhaling. Along with that I think I was having vocal tics to I\u2019m not sure though. I was making noises like moans/groans and sharply gasping. I never had vocal tics before I only ever had simple motor tics like neck/head jerks, hitting, doing weird stuff with my hands, eye movements, etc. \n\n\nI don\u2019t know if I having tics in my sleep or developed a new tic or something? \nIs this a tic?\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry for my horrible writing and description, I\u2019m dyslexic. I hope this somewhat made sense. What happened this morning freaked me out and I don\u2019t have anyone I could talk to or ask about it without being pushed down or ignored. \n(even though this probably isn\u2019t anything worth listening to i\u2019m sorry)\n\nThank you for reading, again I\u2019m sorry for the horrible writing.

        "context": "Extreme Fatigue, anal itching, cramps + other symptoms... Anxiety?\nBackstory and will try to be short and sweet so it may actually get read:  \nMale, 34, live in Phoenix, from the midwest, Former D1 football player, retired early from a knee injury when I was 19. Amazing family, friends, etc my entire life. Never thought once about having anxiety or that it could be potentially what causes my symptoms, but if not that then what?  \n\\-In March of 2015 I woke up one day at 11am, I felt like i never slept the night before even though I had gone to bed at 10pm or so. I always was a 10pm go to sleep, 6am wake up and work out person. Always in great shape, eating healthy, etc, never done drugs, drink maybe once every couple months. The fatigue was so extreme I just figured I needed more sleep but this never went away.   \nI got very sick (some sort of food poisoning) in Thailand a few months before and thought it could be something related to that but I had been back to normal and perfectly fine for 2 months before the fatigue and many other symptoms began...  \nEvery Day since that day in 2015 I have woke up severely fatigued, and also have been severely fatigued almost all day long. The fatigue is so extreme that I can barely keep my eyes open when its at its worse.   \nOther symptoms that have gone on at the same time:\n\n  \n\\- Extreme Fatigue, Heavy eyes, bloodshot (I can't explain how bad the level of fatigue is because its not something a normal person would ever feel. I played college football, worked on farms in the morning, had 2 practices a day, lifted, went to class, etc and I wasn't 1/10th of the exhausted I am now)  \n\\- Dandruff  \n\\- Muscle cramps, specifically in my ribs when I am twisting to wipe or twisting for another reason  \n\\- Sinus issues  \n\\- Arm pit sweating (usually this is social)  \n\\- Itchy Anus with rashes (I shower now every time after #2 and it doesn't matter)  \n\\- Occasional dizziness & sharp headaches  \n\\- Heart Palpitations  \n\\- Elevated Blood Pressure (140/90 range)\n\n  \nI went to doctors from 2015-2018 and did every blood test they could think of, CT scans, chest/ab scans, had a colonoscopy, had 2 sinus surgeries, eye exams, sinus exams, had all my amalgam fillings removed and even root canals removed, allergy testing for weeks, did allergy shots for a year, sleep study at home, sleep study in a clinic over night, went to naturopaths and tried different methods they suggested with meds, yeast, etc. I have seen nearly ever single specialty doctor you can think of.   \nDiagnosis from doctors: One wanted to put me on Blood pressure meds when I was 28. I know me blood pressure was never high or elevated until i started feeling miserable everyday so I didnt take them after a few weeks. Couple other doctors told me anxiety and prescribed meds but i never took them as I thought that was a BS response and easy way out. Others have said Chronic fatigue syndrome but most of the symptoms aren't relevant. Had biopsy on rash on itchy anus and came back completely normal. All my blood tests, scans, etc have always came back perfectly normal.  \nWhy I think anxiety or something with mental health could be the cause of all of this:\n\n  \n\\- The best I feel is when I am outside mowing, golfing, working on the house, showering, sex or masturbating, being pretty active doing something I enjoy doing. The fatigue(which is by far my worst symptom) almost vanishes when Im more active in one way or another.  \n\\- If I am inside sitting on couch or chair or laying down or watching TV or at the grocery story or furniture store etc my fatigue is almost always extremely severe where my eyes are so blood shot and I can't function  \n\\- I know I have had health anxiety in the past to some extent. I thought in elementary I had neck cancer because I kept doing this certain stretch with my neck that I always felt I needed to do. I had a panic attack and went to the ER in 2013 when I thought i was having a heart attack randomly. When the ice bucket challenge was going on, I had pins and needles all over my body for 2 weeks following that after doing a bit of research on ALS. I do frequently look on google for my symptoms or someone else with a similar story and have never found one.  \n\\- When my symptoms are present its  all i can think about. I cant enjoy anything because the fatigue is so bad its all i can think of and it will even make me nauseaus.  \n\\- I have always had intrusive thoughts. Never would I ever act on anything but always kind of felt it was weird but figured others had them too (example: in the huddle with football coach and thinking, if I just punched him in the face what would everyone do\")  \n\\- When we are going somewhere where I have felt extreme fatigue before, I cant stop thinking about it and then of course the fatigue is very bad there  \n\\- Many times before something social I will get extremely fatigued but when I get talking to people or having fun It usually gets better  \n\\- I can be extremely fatigued sitting in my house watching tv and then go out in the sun and mow the lawn or go for a walk and almost always feel less fatigued and somewhat normal  \n\\- I feel like my thoughts have always been able to create symptoms no matter what I do to try to stop them but I can't get rid of it.  \n\\- I've had premature ejaculation in the past with girlfriends when I knew we were likely going to have sex and its all i could think about, I would PE almost immediately when i took my pants off (sorry for the TMI).  \n\\- I've also had ED with long term girlfriend and fiance when I knew it was in my head.'  \n\\- My arm pits will sweat out of control in certain situations that I don't want to sweat and I am usually thinking \"don't sweat\" and then I do profusely.   \n\\- If I am sick or have a bad cold I actually feel less fatigued ( I think because my mind is on something else)  \n\\- My symptoms have never got better but they've also never got worse. They have been almost exactly the same for 8 years and counting.  \nAfter writing all this down I feel everyone will be like that is obviously anxiety but the problem is I never felt anxious at all unless I was extremely fatigued. So I have always thought the extreme fatigue was causing my anxiety because it doesn't allow me to do many things that I want to do.   \nIf it is anxiety, do I get on Meds? I was prescribed Lexapro via ForHIMS a few months ago after filling out the quiz to see if it was anxiety. I honestly have been afraid to take them because I dont want it to make me even more fatigued than I already am where I can barely function at all when I have a child to care for now. Do I talk to a therapist? If my mind is causing all of this, How do i get it to shift or my mind to not create all of these real symptoms. I haven't enjoyed life as I think somethings been wrong with me all the years but is it just anxiety doing that? Please help thank you",

I\u2019m a 39F, Caucasian, 5\u20195\u2019 and overweight. \n\nI have had chronic lower back pain for the past 13-14 years and I am not sure if that is causing the weird sensations I\u2019ve had in my legs recently or if it\u2019s maybe something else.\n\nFor the past year, I\u2019ve been experiencing my 3 inner toes on my left foot going numb. It seems to happen randomly and is not brought on by anything specific that I\u2019m doing. Likewise, my hips, butt, and upper thighs have cramping up. It feels as if my thigh muscles just lock up and get stiff. \n\nI\u2019ve been attributing all of that to my normal LBP that I\u2019ve been dealing with all these years, thinking maybe my back issues are getting a little worse, but at the end of June I started feeling something I\u2019ve never felt before. I was walking through my house and suddenly felt as if water was dripping onto the back of my left calf, near the bend of my knee.  It felt extremely cold, bordering on freezing. And it was just a constant drip drip drip feeling as well as a feeling of my calf in that spot being wet. The \u201cwet spot\u201d started out no bigger than a quarter, but the sensation grew over the course of a week and ended up feeling like a puddle on the back of my calf the size of a silver dollar. By the time I got in with my primary, the feeling was gone. \n\nAfter that, I\u2019ve felt more cramping in my legs and calves, but I\u2019ve also felt as if there is a hair or a string across my lower shin. This feeling comes and goes, and it feels like it\u2019s horizontal across my shin, like walking through a trip wire or something. Except the sensation is faint. Like someone loosely taped a string across a door and I walked through it. This is also on my left leg. \n\nHow likely is it that this is just the effects of my regular lower back pain? Or is this maybe something more that should be addressed and evaluated? My pcp ordered all relevant blood tests to rule out things such as diabetes and my labs came back as normal, except for my C-reactive protein level, which was 1.1 mg/dL.",

The accidents also stopped. But she\u2019s continued to complain.  This past week, July 17th, her stools have been very loose and she had a few times where she has pooped a small amount in her underwear. Her stools resemble a Type 6 on the Bristol stool scale. This morning, she had a reddish color to her stool. I took her to the doctor. I requested a stool test and blood work. Both requests were denied. The doctor suggested a fleet enema to clear the system and reassess in a week. I feel that this would be too extreme. She diagnosed her with possible Encopresis. I\u2019m not sure I agree. I\u2019ll be contacting a pediatric GI doc next week. Do you agree with the Encopresis diagnosis? Would you do the fleet enema?\nAny other possible ideas\u2026\n\nShe denied the tests since my daughter is acting normal.

Always feeling tired and sleepy, difficulty waking up in the morning so often oversleeps.\n\n2. Currently taking lamotrigine for my epilepsy (general, idiopathic) - for 3 years already\nBut epilepsy started when i was 10 y.o.\nMy meds could have contributed to my sleepiness but even before taking it, i still easily get tired. I even tried dozing off in the middle of an exam. Sometimes sleepy and feels like floating while walking along session road\n\n3. Epilepsy trigerred by painful menstruation (definitely adenomyosis, probably endometriosis too)\nor sleep lower than 6 hrs\n\n4. I sometimes suddenly wake up at night and feel dizzy. My heart also beat so fast. I think that I will have an epileptic attack when i experience this.\n\n5. I have GERD. Experience post nasal drip. Difficulty talking for long periods of time which makes it difficult to teach.\n\n6. Painful legs and feet almost everyday. I like to walk but minimize it cause I have flat foot.\nSometimes my calf just hurts so bad. I also easily get cramps to the extent that I couldn't walk sometimes, even if I just sit down for 30 mins.\nMy back also hurts sometimes to the point that I couldnt wake up.\n\n7. Preliminary assessment is I have ADD (without the H in adhd cause i don't have energy), little bit of OCD, and low spatial intelligence. With this, I have difficulty studying (and so other tasks). It would take me about 20 mins to finish 1 page. It depends with the font, it could even take an hour. In a word (esp those used in science and med), I can only remember the 1st and last syllables. I am also always day-dreaming so I hope I won't be bumped by a car one day because of being absent minded.\n\nI feel that I am too slow when studying or doing tasks in the day time but I can't go on with lack of sleep either. How can I be able to go to med school with these? \n\nI tried Sertraline and apparently, I am sensitive (forgot what particular type of sensitivity but it's not common for other patients of my former dr.). I was nearly sent to the ER because I thought I was dying with all the dizziness and vomiting. Thank God did not have a seizure though (i wouldn't want to lose more brain cells when i already have so little).\n\nNow, I'm thinking of taking methylplenidate (along with lamotrigine which is my maintenance) but I was traumatized with the Sertraline.\n\nOther possible needed info:\n24F\n5'3\" 55 kg\nDiet: no pork, usually eggs or oats for breakfast, veggies with beef or liver, pasta with tuna, banana snd others (depending on what's available)\nExercise: one step higher than sedentary, exercise bike at home (in my defense, i am very busy and don't know how to manage my time properly, it's difficult for me. And I'm flat footed so even if i like taking a walk, i must minimize it. Probably lack of discipline too cause I wake up at 10:00 or 10:30 if i don't have to go to school. I really do my very best to improve my habits but I really can't wake-up.)\n\nMy activities: taking up masters (online only about 5 hours a week), teaching undergrad classes part-time (14 hours a week only) , doing online writing jobs (almost every evening)\n\nHow can I solve these? Though this may sound absurd to some, I am truly experiencing this. I have been to several doctors but I haven't really improved yet. I'm not blaming or questioning their expertise because it is a \"me\" problem but I still would want other perspectives/ medical opinions on my case.\n\nThanks so much for spending your time reading this.",

I do not currently take any long term medications, but have taken medications related to this that I will get to later.\n\nI\u2019m also noting that my wife and I moved into a new house approximately 2 1/2 months ago, pertinent as she suggests it may be something in the house; but she is not exhibiting any symptoms at all.\n\n**Whats going on**\n\nAbout a month ago I started exhibiting pretty severe coughing fits that were largely isolated to right before going to bed, and right after waking up. I would still cough during the day, but mostly intermittently. \n\nMost of the coughing feels relatively dry and surface level, every once in awhile when I clear my throat I\u2019ll feel a little bit of a wetness, but usually not associated with the cough itself.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s important [maybe not] but typically when I wake up and cough I\u2019ll feel almost like a metallic taste at the back of my throat.\n\nLargely isolated to right before bed I\u2019ve also dealt with pretty severe shortness of breath, though coughing generally clears it up for very brief periods of time - I have noticed very mild shortness of breath during the day, but it mostly goes unnoticed.  I also experience some sever wheezing while trying to sleep, which presents in sort of a small mouse like and almost cute noise\n\nI have still been maintaining a jogging routine 2-3 times a week, and I seem unaffected by breathing during these times.\n\n**What have I done about this**\n\nAs we just moved I don\u2019t yet have a GP, and I recognize I do need to find one, I\u2019m hoping to get some insight here beforehand. At the moment I\u2019ve been to urgent care twice:\n\n- The first time the doctor looked at me and determined all of the coughing was coming from my head, and that my oxygen levels were completely normal, there was no sign of issues in my chest or lungs. The belief was that it was entirely environmental from the current air qualities [we live in NJ, but the wildfire related air quality has been relatively normal for weeks].\n  - I was given a nasal spray to take twice a day, as well as Benzonatate. Both of which I took 100% as instructed.\n- A week later I returned to the Urgent Care having had no relief. A different doctor looked more thyroid hot and determined mostly the same thing.\n  - I was given a 5 day course of Prednisone and a 10 day course of Amoxicillin, both of which I took to completion\n\nWe are now at day 11 past that second Urgent Care visit, I would estimate that I felt almost 100% relief for the first 6-7 days while taking these medications. However on the tail end have noticed these symptoms coming back in full force.  \n\nI\u2019m just trying to figure out what\u2019s wrong - most of what I see online suggests major disorders that I don\u2019t feel fit the bill.",

There is no FDA-approved confirmatory test available, so we cannot determine which of these situations applies to you...*\n\nIf it's worth noting, in the gap from the successful donation in 2019 through the flagged result in 2021, I had no new sexual partners and had no accidental needle sticks (I work in EMS)**.\\*\\*\\*** Since I was vaccinated as an infant and I thought this was a vaccine that \"lasts for life,\" I assumed the result was a false positive and went a few weeks later to donate at a different blood center organization (they don't share donor info across organizations, so nobody was the wiser).\n\nThis second blood center flagged:\n\n|Hepatitis B core total antibodies IGg and IGm|Positive|\n|:-|:-|\n|HBsAG|Negative|\n|HBV NAT|Negative|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I went and had a blood panel done by my GYN, for which the results were:\n\n|HBsAG|Nonreactive|\n|:-|:-|\n|HBsAB|Reactive|\n|HBs antibody R|Reactive|\n|HBs antibody S|Indeterminate|\n|HBs antibody S, quantitative|7.2 mIU/mL|\n\nAnd based on this, my provider said my antibodies were teetering or something like that, and instructed me to get vaccinated again.\n\nSo, from the end of 2021 through mid-2022, I did the three vaccinations to be fully vaccinated against Hep B. Assuming that this would solve my problem of having weird blood results in my blood donations, I went last month to donate plasma. I was flagged again!\n\n|Hepatitis B core total antibodies IGg and IGm|Positive|\n|:-|:-|\n|HBsAG|Negative|\n|HBV NAT|Negative|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe way I'm seeing this is either\n\n1. I have an underlying thing (ie. auto-immune disease) causing these unexpected test results\n2. I had 3 or 4 false positives in a row (what are the odds?)\n3. I had the unfortunate luck of my vaccine wearing off after \\~21-22 years of getting it as an infant, and somehow, when I wasn't sexually active or exposed to any needle sticks, I got infected with Hep B.\n\n**Can any medical professionals here please share their thoughts or insights on this? Should my next steps be to see a hematologist, or should I see a hepatologist?** \n\n\\*\\*\\*In 2020, I was sick with something unknown for two or three months- wasn't COVID-19 or EBV. Bloodwork was done and the liver panel was flagged (see timeline below). A follow-up ultrasound of the liver showed no abnormal findings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***My pertinent past medical history:*** *ADHD that is treated with high-dose stimulants, no other daily meds or pertinent history.

        "context": "Frequent nasal infections and immune system problems, not taken seriously by doctors\nI'm 32F, white, 5' 4\", 180lbs, having concerns about my immune system.\n\nKnown conditions: C-PTSD, autism, ADHD, HPV, HSV-1, lactose intolerance, suspected IBS-D, history of Reactive Arthritis, history of benign ovarian and breast cysts.\n\nMedicines used: nothing but microdosing psilocybin to treat PTSD (started recently)\n\n\n\nThere are quite a few things going on and I'm not sure what all is connected and what is unrelated, so I'll try explaining it all the best I can. It's long, but I'm desperate and I don't want to miss anything. I'd be grateful if I could get some insight and pointers what specialists to see and what investigations to request.\n\nIn summer 2020 I gave birth to my first child. Unfortunately, this childbirth was very traumatic as I experienced obstetric violence and had a near-death experience during delivery. As a result I now have C-PTSD.\n\nIn winter 2020 I got a severe sinus infection. I think this was the first sinus infection I ever had in my life. Very quickly, on top of sinus pains and massive amounts of green-yellow puss coming from my nose, I started having extreme flu-like body pains. It was sharp pain that's hard to describe for how insanely intense it was. I had no fever, yet I constantly felt like the most violent fever was shaking me and tearing my body apart. Like all my limbs were infected and butchered. It felt like it's both muscle and bone pain and it was predominantly in long bones of arms and legs.\n\nAt that pandemic time GPs weren't seeing anyone face to face and I was repeatedly dismissed over the phone. The only thing they did was to give me a saline nasal rinse! I couldn't get rid of this horrendous infection for about 2 months. I was pretty much non functional all that time, spending all my time sitting on the sofa shaking and crying in pain, unable to take care of my baby. I developed extreme brain fog, to the point I couldn't read a newspaper article or do simple sums (this now improved slightly, but not completely). After being dismissed several times, I stopped trying and sank into depression out of desperation of being invisible, just surviving day to day. I had neither strength nor mental capacity to stand up for myself because at that point, I was in an extremely dark place due to PTSD, probably a step away from suicidal. I was regularly waking up screaming and crying from nightmares about my baby being killed and mutilated. Doctors downplayed everything, my sinus infection was \"a bit of an infection, rinsing will help\", my PTSD was \"a little bit of postpartum anxiety\" (it took doctors over 2 years to start taking it seriously), my body pains were \"all in my head due to anxiety, I should take some antidepressants and the pains will stop\".\n\nSo I spent around 2 months as a zombie. Eventually the infection was gone - however something has changed in my body. Ever since that infection I haven't been the same. My health is ruined, my immune system feels *extremely overactive*. It's been 2.5 years and  my longest stretch of feeling normal and healthy was maybe a couple of days. I pretty much constantly live with flu-like symptoms. Body pains are now not as bad as they were during that first occurrence, but they're still here. I'd say I have episodes of bone/muscle pains and brain fog. These flare ups can be anything from a week apart to 1-2 months apart, but they always come back. If my husband or children are in any way sick, even if it's just a very slight cold, my immune system instantly picks up on it and intense body pains start. When I have something more serious, like when I had Covid (spring 2021, at 20 weeks pregnant) it also instantly results in feeling like my bones and muscles are infected. During Covid my hip was on fire for days, I wanted to scream!\n\nAs for the sinus infection itself, they also come back frequently, I'd say every 2-3 months. They instantly trigger my neck lymph nodes and I can easily have painful glands for good 2-3 weeks. I have random shooting pains in sinuses even when there's no infection (both in frontal, ethmoid and maxillary ones). All these numerous sinus infections significantly worsened my already existing postnasal drip - it sounds a bit shocking, but I've been having postnatal drip ever since I removed my tonsils in 2009! I now have to use steroid nose drops pretty much daily to reduce the amount of drip.\n\nIn recent months something else started happening on top of sinus infections and body pains. I started getting frequent infections in my nostrils. The moment I start feeling the beginning of it in a nostril, lymph nodes start hurting. I don't feel they're really swollen, just painful. These nostril infections alone can cause 2-3 weeks of painful glands. Sinus infections and nostril infections often come together.\n\nMy first nostril infection happened in winter 2021 when I was 6 weeks pregnant with my second, together with a sinus infection. This involved entire vestibules of both nostrils being infected. After a few days of increasing pain, the edge of one nostril developed cellulitis. GP saw this as an infection first caused by a virus, with a secondary bacterial infection. The cellulitis was treated with a combination of antiviral cream and several weeks of antibiotics (flucloxacilin). Then there was silence for a while during pregnancy, but after childbirth everything came back.\n\nThis spring out of nowhere I had my first herpes infection on lips. I had no idea herpes can be that big and last that long! It lasted 4 weeks, I had 4 massive blisters that left scars, and the infection triggered my neck glands again. I felt like I was dying for weeks.\n\nNasal infections are now happening so often I stopped calling doctors about it, I just use the leftover neomicin or mupirocin I have from a previous infection because I call the GP about my pains and infections so often, I can feel the eyes rolling. I fear they started seeing me as a hypochondriac. I'm NOT a hypochondriac, I live in serious pain for the last 2.5 years, I'm constantly sick, and all of it is affecting my quality of life. I stopped working because of body pains and brain fog, my job was my passion and the loss of it really affects me mentally. I worry about how to take care of my children. All this pain + PTSD is causing a horrible health anxiety. I don't feel it's normal to constantly have some sort of infection, have painful glands and have bone and muscle pains.\n\nI have a nasal infection right now, I don't know whether it's the same thing as before or is it a herpes infection this time?! I got flucloxacilin tablets and mupirocin cream for it. The GP hasn't swabbed it or anything, they just love handing out antibiotics over here... My glands are painful once again.\n\nOne of several GPs I talked to took me half seriously and thought my pains are Fibromyalgia triggered by PTSD and/or Arthritis. He considered a possibility of seronegative Rheumatoid Arthritis because my immune system seems to be triggered so much, but my RF and CCP are negative. He gave me a referral to see a Rheumatologist because of my history (still waiting for the appointment!), which is Poststreptococcal Reactive Arthritis at the age of 17. At that time, I was fighting RA for almost one year before doctors started believing me, it got to the point where I fell onto the floor during training, unable to move from pain in my ankles and wrists. My antistreptolysin O titre (ASO) was around 1200 IU/ml and X-rays taken at that time showed reduced mineralisation of my left wrist (I have to point out my mother, grandmother and aunt all had osteopenia!), but doctors weren't concerned I'll have any further issues with Arthritis. Guess they were wrong... The GP thinks my Reactive Arthritis is not back, he last checked my ASO in 2021 and it came back as 400. I'm not sure I'm convinced tbh. I never got a referral for an ENT because my sinus infections weren't taken seriously, which I think is wrong.\n\nAnother thing I have to point out that speaks in favour of something being wrong with my immune system is that I have HPV that my body seems to be unable to clear. Every smear and colposcopy has been positive since 2019. When I mentioned all of my other troubles to my colposcopist, she encouraged me to investigate further whether something is wrong with my immune system. Thankfully the HPV didn't progress to CIN1, all this time I only had borderline changes. I had cold coagulation earlier this month.\n\nThis is it. Thank you if you were willing to read this far. If anyone has any idea what is going on here please share and tell me where do I go from here, what tests and what specialists do I need.\n\nThank you",

        "context": "Facial pain / Osteoma (26M)\nHi guys. I\u2019ve had this chronic pain on the left hand side between my nose/sinus/teeth for years. The dentist ruled out a dental cause and suggested seeing an ENT. They found an osteoma in the site of pain but claim it can't cause facial pain, yet all the studies I read say it can.\n\nI'm 26m, white, 5ft 10, social smoker/light drinker, UK, tried gabapentinoids to no avail.  \nI had a scan done and the ENT said there was \u2018white\u2019 on the region of the scan and he didn\u2019t know what it was. So he referred me to another ENT department he thought could help.  \nThey couldn\u2019t access his scan and to my recollection they ordered another one. They told me that they found an osteoma at the exact location of my pain, however they don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for an osteoma to cause facial pain. So they referred me to a pain clinic who said it was \u2018idiopathic facial pain\u2019 and probably neurological in origin. They said my best bet was seeing a \u2018pain psychologist\u2019 and taking nerve pain medication (which hasn\u2019t helped at all).  \nI felt I wanted a second opinion on the osteoma and the pain, and finally got seen again by the ENT. They stated they couldn\u2019t access either of my scans, and had no record of the second scan and that it probably \u2018didn\u2019t happen\u2019 (it did). Nonetheless, he still was adamant that the osteoma couldn\u2019t cause facial pain and that pain psychology was the only treatment.  \nNow, every study I have read states that sinus osteomas can and often do cause facial pain.  \n\u2018The most common symptom of paranasal osteomas is pain including headache and facial pain (Atallah and Jay, 1981).\u2019 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319453411001044#:\\~:text=The%20clinical%20presentation%20of%20paranasal,Atallah%20and%20Jay%2C%201981).  \nIt seems bizarre to me that there would be an osteoma at the exact location of the pain that\u2019s unrelated. What\u2019s even more bizarre to me is being told it can\u2019t cause facial pain when every study says it does.  \nNow I\u2019m not certain this is the cause of the pain. However it confused me. Furthermore, I am not happy with the idiopathic/nerve diagnosis. They arrived at that from simply not finding another cause, and it really doesn\u2019t feel like a nerve problem to me (it feels very structural/physical, largely affected by pressure, I can feel/hear liquid/fluid opening closing etc).  \nThey have stated they are going to try and locate the past scan, however that was from 4 years ago. I will pursue a new scan, but i am not convinced of whether the response will be any better.  \nAny thoughts or advice would be useful!  \nThanks",

[26F]\nTL;DR: *\"To Hep B, or not to Hep B?\"* Can any medical professionals here please share their thoughts or insights on this? Should my next steps be to see a hematologist, or should I see a hepatologist?   \n\n\nI try to donate whole blood or plasma whenever possible. Blood donation centers in the U.S. test donations for Hep B antibodies, among many other things. I made successful donations of whole blood, platelets, and plasma from 2014-2019. At the age of 3 months, I received three rounds of Hep B vaccines for full vaccination- so, since my donations for 5 years were successful, clearly the vaccine was doing its job.\n\nIn October 2021, I received a letter following a blood donation that essentially said I was permanently ineligible for donating because of these results:\n\n|Hep B core total antibody  (anti-HBc)|Positive|\n|:-|:-|\n|HBsAG|Negative|\n|Additional HBsAG Neutralization test|Not Tested|\n|HIV-1/HCV/HBV NAT screening test|Negative|\n|HBV NAT|Negative|\n\nThe letter explained *\"These test results may indicate a past HBV infection or a false-positive reaction. There is no FDA-approved confirmatory test available, so we cannot determine which of these situations applies to you...*\n\nIf it's worth noting, in the gap from the successful donation in 2019 through the flagged result in 2021, I had no new sexual partners and had no accidental needle sticks (I work in EMS)**.\\*\\*\\*** Since I was vaccinated as an infant and I thought this was a vaccine that \"lasts for life,\" I assumed the result was a false positive and went a few weeks later to donate at a different blood center organization (they don't share donor info across organizations, so nobody was the wiser).\n\nThis second blood center flagged:\n\n|Hepatitis B core total antibodies IGg and IGm|Positive|\n|:-|:-|\n|HBsAG|Negative|\n|HBV NAT|Negative|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I went and had a blood panel done by my GYN, for which the results were:\n\n|HBsAG|Nonreactive|\n|:-|:-|\n|HBsAB|Reactive|\n|HBs antibody R|Reactive|\n|HBs antibody S|Indeterminate|\n|HBs antibody S, quantitative|7.2 mIU/mL|\n\nAnd based on this, my provider said my antibodies were teetering or something like that, and instructed me to get vaccinated again.\n\nSo, from the end of 2021 through mid-2022, I did the three vaccinations to be fully vaccinated against Hep B. Assuming that this would solve my problem of having weird blood results in my blood donations, I went last month to donate plasma.

I struggled with constipation and feeling like I was never finished when I went to the bathroom. I had mucus in stool and on the rare occasion that I would get pain from constipation lasting too long,  I would have these brief fainting spells or just feel really dizzy.\n\nMoving forward to now I've been suffering from stomach pain since the start of this year in my lower abdomen around my belly button and pelvis- mainly situated in the center and left side, constantly going back and forth between constipation and diarrhea, with nothing subsiding the pain aside from eating which slightly lessened it until I hurt even worse at night. Between the pain and the fatigue it brought with it, I've been unable to carry on with my usual activities and mostly find myself lying in pain for most of the day. I first went to my PCP who sent out abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds, as well as blood tests testing for celiac, all of which came back normal.\n\nUpon following up with my GI doctor I did a colonoscopy, in which I was unable to properly do the prep as the solution made me nauseous and so some areas were not clear. He told me however that my results were normal aside from some small hemorrhoids. I later did a H. Pylori breath test, as my dad had gotten it around this time, which came back negative. I recently did an endoscopy where a biopsy was sent which was found to be normal aside from mild gastritis, which brings me here.\n\nAside from potentially repeating the colonoscopy or doing a CT scan- which terrifies me because of the radiation- I don't know where to turn next, and hate that there almost seems to be no root cause to my symptoms.

If I remember the numbers correctly, he said that almost all of my events are CSA with a few OSA events and I have an average of 94 events per hour and my brain wakes up an average of 68 times per hour. During the appointment he asked me if I had any history or had been seen for MS, ALS or Parkinson\u2019s before. I\u2019m only 28 so of course I haven\u2019t. He said that central sleep apnea is very rare (compared to OSA), and that almost everyone who has CSA also has an underlying condition of MS, ALS, or Parkinson\u2019s. So I asked what I need to do to either confirm that or rule it out, and he told me not to worry about it because if it happens it happens and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it anyway so it\u2019s useless to spend my time worrying. But having a doctor tell you that he thinks you have a high chance of having a terminal illness but just don\u2019t worry about it isn\u2019t exactly helpful. Since then I\u2019ve been searching around online to try and find some sort of data or statistic on the correlation between CSA and MS, ALS, and Parkinson\u2019s, but I\u2019ve found very little information.

        "context": "Can I ever learn to have a healthy relationship?\n26m black\n\nFor my entire life, at least as long as i can remember, ive had severe social anxiety. Like every other guy with this issue it's made it historically impossible for me to engage in relationships with women. I don't hate women. I have always acknowledged that I am the problem in this equation. \n\nI'm from a poor, ghetto neighborhood in a poor, ghetto city. My father (65m) abandoned us before I can remember. My older brother (29 now, m) was a notorious womanizer and known gang banger, currently serving 20yrs for his involvement in a murder. When i was 17 and he was 20, his gf (~20 f) at the time along with my older sister (23 f then) hired a mutual \"friend\" of theirs (who I do not know outside of this incident) to take my virginity. For $50. This was a 15 year old girl who already had a child (2 things I did not know at the time of the event). \n\nShe came over. My sister and my brothers gf let her in and led her to my room, they then waited downstairs for us to do what she had been paid to do. We had sex except I couldn't finish. I'm not sure how long we actually went on for but at some point I just pretended to finish so that it could be over. I don't remember feeling traumatized at the time. I just remember the girls reaction. As far as i could tell based on what she said and the way her body reacted, i thought she enjoyed it. I remember her offering to see me again free of charge. I feel disgusting writing that. I don't say that to imply that all sex workers or those who are trafficked enjoy what is done to them, or that I'm some whiz in the bedroom.  This was almost a decade ago, she may very well have been faking it and the memory formed as it did due to naivete. But in my memory she genuinely enjoyed it. \n\nThe feelings this left me with were mixed and I certainly wasn't aware at the time of the trauma that was being inflicted on both of our young minds. I remember a mix of shame and pride. Shame at my inability to \"get\" a girl ( sexist terminology, girls are not property, but thats how i was brought up to speak about it) and simultaneous pride at my apparent \"skills\" despite my lack of experience. I was happy to have lost my virginity.\n\nAt this point in my life I understand the violence, depravity and trauma that the \"industry\" is rife with and I want no further part of it. This girl wasn't a sex worker. She was 15 year old girl who was being trafficked by people I was close to. I'm not sure either of us had conscious awareness of it at the time. In hindsight this damaged my view of women and relationships even further. \n\nIn my head from that point on, that was a normal thing. It was what guys did, especially if they had money. I convinced myself of that. I listened to the media and people around me. \"It ain't tricking if you got it\". \"What's the difference between that and paying for everything in a relationship\" so on and so forth. As a 26 year old man I hear how pathetic and disgusting those sentiments are, but it's something I've only really understood disturbingly recently. \n\nI've had consensual sexual relationships between then and now, although few. None for more than several months. But I've continued to use escorts since then. I remember being around 20 and being addicted to it. I saw as many women as I could in one night. Eventually I stopped this because of purely financial reasons, that was totally unsustainable for a broke college kid. Then I graduated, moved away and started my career. Older now, but no wiser I moved to a new city and began the habit again. Off and on this time as I battled the shame. A shame that I never really was able to understand or reconcile. Until today. I guess I've probably understood it for longer, but today, as a write this, crystallizing the thoughts, I can only just now be certain. \n\nIt's been a few months since I've done it. I decided to go to therapy for my social anxiety. Turns out my first sexual experience wasn't the only childhood trauma I wasn't aware of. The same sister who helped set up that encounter was also the reason I felt I needed it. Her verbal abuse in our youth had convinced me that I was unattractive to my core. I was fat, ugly, and stupid. That was me. And no one would ever want someone like me. \n\nSince having this breakthrough, approaching women has become a lot easier. I AM a physically attractive man, I can finally say that I see that about myself, but I still struggle with romance, as is to be expected from someone essentially getting started at my age. Thankfully, I do actually have decent in person social skills. I suck over text. I'm pretty sure I come off as clingy or desperate or maybe boring or all of the above. I'm not sure when to start or end a conversation over text. I think I overshare. Whatever. Stuff I can work on. Like I said, I know that I'm the problem here and have to continue to work on myself. \n\nAll that said, I've been putting myself out there and introducing myself to women in social situations, and I've even gotten a few phone numbers in person over the past few weeks. I've been ghosted by 2 of them and been told by the third that she's just interested in being friends. I'll be honest and say in the moment of being ghosted by the last I woman I got angry. Partially because of being ghosted before the date we had set up that night but partially because I was already having an awful day when the cherry on top was getting ghosted and stood up. I had driven across the state to visit my brother in prison but had lost my ID and was rightfully turned away because of it. I then had to drive to a totally separate state because of work (I travel for work) only to get to my prebooked hotel and remember that I don't have an ID. No refund, of course. I threw my phone out of frustration after being hung up on by the customer service AI, which bounced off my dash and cracked my car window. Ended up paying out the ass for an airbnb. I was genuinely having a bad day. (And I hired a new therapist for anger management today) I am not angry at her. In hindsight, I definitely see the red flags I gave her. I can't reiterate enough that at the end of the day, I know I'm the one with the problem here.\n\nToday is the day after. I'm sitting here in a strip mall parking lot across from a cheap motel where there is an escort who expected me to show up 30 mins ago. I decided against it at the last moment. I started thinking about a future partner and what she might say. Then about the fact that one can never truly know the circumstances that drove a person to sex work and that i cannot allow myself to contribute to this kind of exploitation anymore. Then i started googling and reading and finally writing this post. I can't do this anymore. Not with everything I know as an adult. I'm ashamed it took me so long to realize why I shouldn't do it, but I finally have. \n\n\nI guess my question for you, assuming you make it this far is, do I even have a chance of ever being healthy and finding love? In your opinion? I guess I'm asking myself as much as I'm asking everyone else. After reliving all of this, do I feel like I deserve a chance with any well adjusted woman? I honestly don't know. But I can't keep doing this. That's for certain.",

I have been under severe unexplained circumstances for like 4 years now. \n\n**A quick historical background**\n\nI have always had a troubled childhood. A madman for a father who was almost wrestling with us all, most of the time. He was so violent domestically that I used to pray for his death, not gonna lie. Abandoned us when I was like 15. On top of that, when my mother could have been my go-to person, she always found ways to further ridicule me, torture me, and made me question my existence. I have 2 sisters and 3 brothers apart from me and the thing is, genetically all of them are more like my mom (fair-complexioned), and only I am the one genetically close to my dad (brown-complexioned). \n\nMaybe she saw my dad in me. I used to scrub my skin for hours and hurt myself just because my mom thought I didn\u2019t look as fair as others. To keep it short, it was a disastrous upbringing. My elder brothers used to hit me so bad when I was at max 8-10 and I don\u2019t claim to be Jesus, but what wrong could a 10-year-old possibly do? My mom used to hit me whenever she got the chance. \n\nTo keep it short, I have spent the first 18-20 years of my life worrying about things, being anxious all the time, in fight or flight mode, and questioning how I looked. In no way was I a failure as a kid. I was totally obedient, more than I should have been, ideally. I was exceedingly good at academics and got distinctions all my studying years. I was really good at sports. I won declamation contests in my childhood in my region with all that was happening around me. The only point I am trying to make here is that I was a very good child checking almost all the boxes.\n\n**The albuterol incident**\n\nNow I was never bothered much by whatever was happening around me until one day I had this huge huge overdose of Albuterol when I was trying to treat my asthma but filled the whole nebulizer chamber with the drug instead of mixing it up. So it must have been a stupidly high dose ranging up to 20 mg and that is a killer dose. Ideally, all the side effects should have vanished in around 5-6 hours. The effects included severe severe high BP, severe palpitations, severe heart pain, and vertigo and I felt like dying in short. \n\nHowever, the symptoms never actually went away. I started losing weight very quickly and went from 72 kg to 54 in a couple of months. Severe GERD came in, severe diarrhea, bloating, and a lot happening to my heart. I couldn\u2019t make sense of anything. I was having sleepless nights. Very rarely did I sleep those days. I started having blurry and kind of disturbed vision. \n\n**Situation now**\n\nTo this day, I have gone to several doctors including gastroentrologists and cardiologists and upon several visits nothing could be found out. \n\nThe cardiologists have cleared me on my ECGs, EKGs, cardiac ultrasound, CT angiography, 24-hour Holter monitor, Exercise Tolerance Test (though it said borderline positive for Ischemia). My blood sugar level tests, potassium level tests, thyroid level tests and even Renal Functions Tests have been examined but nothing was found.\n\nThe thing is, I have severe symptoms(which I will explain more later), which I seriously think are because of the Albuterol overdose becaue everything went downhill from there and I had nothing physically hurting me before that.   \n\nUpon my last visit to my cardiologist, he aslo consulted another general physician and they both told me that I was dealing with FIBROMYALGIA and that Albuterol event only played a trigger for everything that came in afterwards. \n\nI will start mentioning whatever symptoms I have and you people please help me find out if I really have it or not.\n\nFatigue: I have severe fatigue syndrome. I do not remember the last time I felt fresh. Probably 4 years ago. I am almost always severely drained out. I do not feel like doing things I once enjoyed. Not just I don\u2019t feel like doing them, I have zero energy to do them. It feels like I do not have an ounce of will to do things.\n\nHigh BP: My BP has been recorded touching 160/90 at multiple occurrences on different doctor\u2019s visits. Maybe some of it is due to the anxiety I have while visiting a doctor. But I know it for a fact that I am dealing with high BP. I have constant pressure in my head and sometime it feels like I will fall down due to eqarthquake-y feeling as BP seems to be touching high numbers.\n\nConstant headaches: Now the headaches might be due to high BP obviously but I have these constant headaches. Like something has been placed on my head for so so long.\n\nStiff muscles: My body always feels like its is imploding inwards. Everything feels so tight and not in rest. Like generally, it feels like tightening up. \n\nGeneral body pain: Apart from fatigue and everything, my body really hurts all over. I can never point out where the pain is but it just hurts. Especially my limbs (thighs even more)  hurt a lot. \n\nUnexplained dry, hardened and tingling lips: I drink a lot of water during the day but after the Albuterol incident, my lips are always dry and hard.\n\nSevere loss of libido: Before the incident, I did have a very high libido. Now I have zero. I'm not proud of it but it was very hard to control my libido and I've fapped 3, 4 times a day. But after the overdose, I hardly feel like doing it. Been months I felt the need to, tbh.\n\nNeedling in my limbs whenever I sit on ground for long: Whenever I rest my limbs under some pressure for some time, they start needling. Sometimes it's so bad that i can't stand. It's like my legs will sometimes go on a sleep and I won't be able to stand.\n\nChest pain and all cardiac symptoms: My chest at the left side hurts a lot. I have severe palpitations that I can feel all over my body. Like I can feel my heart in my legs and stomach. BP soares to unbearable numbers. \n\nGERD and stomach problems: The GERD was very bad a couple years ago and not that bad now. But I normally feel indigestion and never have a very good feeling after I eat.\n\nEarthquake-y feeling: My hunch is I feel it when I have BP rising high but whatever it is, it is horrifying. I feel vertigo and an earthquake-y feeling for several minutes multiple times a day. \n\nWeight loss: Although I have a good weight of around 67kgs (I am 5 feet 7) but I feel like losing my weight. I feel so weak at times that it seems like I am underweight by a margin. \n\nI have been dealing with all this shit for 4 years now and I have multiple times thought about ending it up once and for all. However, I somehow kept going I have no idea why. Please help me out a bit.",

Turns out that all of my issues I had during pregnancy, the cause of my son\u2019s stillbirth, and my chest pain and dizziness were all a result of Rheumatic Heart Disease.\n\nI ended up having a stroke and I thought that would change my urgency of care, but still I was dismissed by all of my providers. My cardiologist was very condescending and said my issues, specifically worsening issues, such as extreme chest pain, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, feeling a cold fluid feeling in my chest, my swollen abdomen and feet, and a hard cough, were just the result of stress and anxiety. I asked for an updated echocardiogram since I had one last year and much has change with my symptoms. I was denied and said an echo was absolutely not needed in my case. \n\nI went to my primary care who was also condescending and said it was anxiety. At the point of anger and tears I told her I felt like I\u2019m dying and I needed help. She said she was not a cardiologist but if it would help me feel better she would order an echocardiogram at the local hospital. \n\nMonday I had the echo. Wednesday I was diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease affecting both the mitral and tricuspid valves. There is still no urgency from my care team. I\u2019m being ignored by my PCP. My cardiologist gave a half-hearted \u201cwe\u2019ll request the echo records\u201d when I called them. I feel even worse. My chest pain now only ends when I feel a burst of fluid that feels like it fills my chest and neck. I\u2019m having trouble breathing all the time. But if I have a feeling if I traveled to the ER again, I\u2019d be dismissed right away just like I was before in pregnancy and earlier postpartum. I\u2019ve had this chest pain for months and especially when I was pregnant but for all the 6 times I went to Labor and Delivery I was discharged right away and never given an EKG or any cardiac work up. Same with my OB. \n\nSeparately, I\u2019m seeing a neurologist for my TIA. He\u2019s found something doing an EEG and multiple MRIs. He won\u2019t tell me the results until my follow up on 2 weeks but told me I absolutely cannot work or drive. \n\nI\u2019m truly at a loss of what to do. If I call the office I get attitude from both the nurses and receptionists. I can\u2019t even find good information on this disease because it seems like it\u2019s not common in developed countries. I live in the US, I\u2019m upper-middle class, I have always taken my full course of antibiotics when I\u2019ve had strep. I just don\u2019t understand how of the thousands and thousands of dollars I\u2019ve spent trying to get help over the past few months all I have to show for it is a permanent heart condition, a dead child, and no plan moving forward.",

I really thought I was imagining the smell, but it is really present in my nose to others as well \n\nThe reason I never went to the doctors with this problem is because whenever I go they shrug everything off.

(May 2022.) \n\n\\* Stepped on Rusty nail in filthiest shoes possible. Photo link below.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/vjtk4e8\n\nI am a teacher and I also enjoy woodworking. I am building a 'Buddy Bench' for our elementary school playground, and we have also been DIY renovating our home this entire summer. I managed to step on an extremely rusty nail that had been outside for weeks. This happened two days ago (on Wednesday.) I was changing the bit on my trim router without gloves (brilliant, I know) and then I clipped the side of my hand and started to bleed. I leaned over to grab a paper towel, tripped, hit the side of my house, bounced off of the siding, ran into the deck railing, and then somehow flipped over my bin of scrap wood/trim and dumped it all over and then landed straight on top of a piece of shoe molding with nails sticking straight up. I jammed my foot down pretty hard/suddenly and the nail blew straight through the sole of my garden boots and punctured a little more than 1/4 inch into my foot. It was enough to cause pretty sharp pain and I did have very minor bleeding. \n\nI went straight upstairs to my bathroom and my husband, who is on peritoneal dialysis here at home, grabbed a ton of his supplies and I immediately: \n\n1.) Washed my hands, put on gloves, and then washed the puncture wound with Hibiclens for about 2-3 minutes (we used a piece of gauze for this.) I let it sit for another minute and then rinsed it off. \n\n2.) New gloves, and then I opened a pair of surgical tweezers from a package and used these to remove a chunk of the sole of my boot from the wound. \n\n3.) Washed the wound again with Hibiclens. \n\n4.) Soaked gauze in the debriding/antimicrobial liquid called 'Except' that he uses to clean his exit site for his PD catheter. I let this sit on my foot for the suggested two minutes. \n\n5.) I applied his Gentamicin ointment to my foot and then covered with a silver alginate dressing and then closed it up with one of his island bandages. I put a new, clean sock on it and then went to urgent care pronto because I believe my last Tetanus shot was in 2013...I just wasn't sure and didn't want to take any chances at all. \n\nI let the P.A at the Urgent Care have a look and he said it definitely got me, but it sounded like I did a solid job cleaning it up initially. He didn't see any more shoe bits inside and put a clean bandage on it for me and then definitely agreed that I needed a tetanus booster, so we got that done and I left. \n\nHe didn't believe I needed any preventative antibiotics at that time but did tell me that if I noticed any signs of infection, increased pain, drainage, fever, etc...to come back immediately. \n\nVaccines can obviously cause you to feel gross for a day or two, and I started feeling like absolute crap last night. Body aches, fatigue, and a very, very sore foot, calf, thigh, and hip. I figured this is from limping/overcompensating and my muscles just hurt. It hurts to ball my foot up or move it much. \n\nMy question is this: Does this sound normal for this situation and is not giving a prophylactic antibiotic the right choice for me? I think the wound looks pretty good, but I'm not a medical professional so I don't trust my own assessment LOL.  I've been keeping it super clean and covered. I'm just worried about possible infection. I don't want/mean to be paranoid, I just don't want to develop any complications. As mentioned above...my husband already has ongoing health problems. We have two young children AND I'm a new teacher that's about to start back to work in two weeks. I do NOT want or need any problems that could have been prevented.\n\nThe P.A was a great guy and I trust him for the most part, I just wanted to see what someone else has to say about it. In the grand scheme of things, this isn't a very severe nail puncture wound, but what bothers me most is the pair of boots I had on. They are absolutely filthy and I have cleaned loads of cat litter, black mold, toilets, garages, been to the landfill repeatedly, and the list goes on. The thought of a chunk of the sole of those nasty things going into my foot (along with a rusty nail) just gives me the creeps :/ \n\nAs long as the wound looks OK and I am up to date on my Tetanus shot, I should be fine to just watch and wait, right? Please ease my mind. \n\n&#x200B;",

        "context": "Periodic inguinal lymph node swelling during pregnancy\nI\u2019m a 32F, generally very healthy, currently am 11 weeks 5 days pregnant with my first child.\n\nSo this actually started about a month before getting pregnant, so this past April. It was my first cycle off of my BC (Annovera) as we intended to start TTC for the first time the next month. I had a lot of fullness and and pain in my lower abdomen, like a combination of period pain and the type of pain from having a very full bladder, going on for about a week. I was also urinating very frequently. I was getting to the point of thinking I should make a doctors appointment (I recently moved and don\u2019t have PC doc in my area yet, which is why I didn\u2019t go sooner).  My thought was possibly I had a UTI, although it didn\u2019t particularly burn when peeing or anything like that.\n\nSo after about a week of this I was out shopping when I randomly went to rub the area that was hurting, and I felt a pretty prominent lump in my left groin area that definitely wasn\u2019t there before. Shortly after I got light headed and started to loose vision, and I had to sit down in the middle of the store (though I didn\u2019t totally loose consciousness). I believe that this was a vagal response (I\u2019ve had them before) probably to freaking myself out by feeling the lump and not passing out directly related to my condition, but obviously I can\u2019t be sure. \n\nSo I recovered from that spell and when I examined the lump some more at home, it seemed pretty obvious it was an inflamed inguinal lymph node. It was moveable and tender. The pain was pretty bad that night and the lymph node still swollen in the AM, so I went to urgent care. The doc there agreed I was feeling a lymph node and that it didn\u2019t seem particularly suspicious for anything like cancer, she examined me to look for any cuts or rashes on my body that might be causing an immune response and found nothing, so agreed it could be a UTI. She sent me home with antibiotics and sent my urine to the lab. I took the antibiotics and by the end of the course the swelling was mostly gone. The urine test came back negative, but I figured since the antibiotics helped it was likely some sort of infection somewhere causing the swelling. I also got my period a few days after the swelling started and my pain resolved after that.\n\nFast forward about a month and I got my positive pregnancy test. I had some bloating and soreness in my lower abdomen that my doc said was typical for early pregnancy, and again had urinary frequency but again, typical for pregnancy. The pain was no where near as bad as the episode a month before. A few weeks after the positive test I noticed my lymph node had swollen again. I did have some bug bites on my leg though on the same side as the lymph node so thought maybe that triggered it this time? It lasted  for a few days before the node felt normal again. The pregnancy has been normal aside for some very light spotting during the 6th week, but my blood work and US came back normal and right on track for where I am in pregnancy. \n\nHowever I am still concerned bc after the bug bites totally cleared, I noticed my lymph node still periodically became swollen and tender, with no apparent cause. It will only last for a day to a few days, then go down, sometimes going from very swollen completely normal overnight. I have noticed that taking Tylenol helps the swelling go away quickly. I mentioned this to my OB after the first time it got swollen in pregnancy, and she said she had no idea what it could be, but if it came back she could refer me to have it examined with ultrasound. But when it came back next, it was gone before I even got a chance to speak with her. The same thing happens every time, it doesn\u2019t stay swollen long enough to have it examined, but it makes me worry every time. What could this be? Could it be my body having a weird pregnancy reaction? If so, why did it first happen before pregnancy?\n\nIn terms of my medical history I had exercise-induced asthma as a kid and have OCD and anxiety (treated with Zoloft). No other chronic medical conditions. I had a CBC as well as infectious disease panel and urinalysis about three weeks ago at my OB and all was normal.",

We have chosen not to become legally married but consider ourselves in a domestic partnership (I mention this to note that while i consider him my husband and am dedicated to him as such, I don\u2019t have the legal rights a legal spouse might have).\n\nBackground details about him: He is white (non-Hispanic) and we live in the USA. He is a 37-year-old cisgender man. He has had long-standing mental health problems (mostly extreme anxiety) since getting sepsis at age 14 which he barely survived. He used to be a heavy drinker before we got together but rarely drinks now. He also used to smoke cigarettes (about 8 a day) and marijuana, but for the past month has cut back on both considerably. He drinks about one energy drink w caffeine daily. He doesn\u2019t do any other recreational drugs. He is prescribed vyvanse, gabapentin, and viibryd for daily use and he *says* he\u2019s been taking them, but I strongly suspect based on the pills he has on hand and his behavior that he hasn\u2019t been for probably 1.5-2 months. He also was prescribed Xanax for occasional panic attacks (so not for daily use) but I don\u2019t think he has taken any in probably 2+ months. He hasn\u2019t seen his psychiatrist in months either. The past year or so was an extremely stressful year for him at work, with the worst occurring about mid-spring of this year, and it was definitely rough for him considering his mental health problems. \n\nCurrent problem: for the past two months he has been declining in every way. He hasn\u2019t showered in at least a month and will only occasionally use bathing wipes I bought for him. He stopped going to work and won\u2019t get a job. He lost his phone for several weeks and had no interest in finding it, so he had to get a new one. He doesn\u2019t spend any time with me and was incredibly rude to his family when they visited last week. He sleeps a lot and spends much of his waking hours in a daze. But most concerningly, he\u2019s become increasingly difficult to converse with. Half of what he says doesn\u2019t make any sense or is filled with non-sequiters. When we went out to eat with his family, he couldn\u2019t even order for himself because he was in a daze. He makes strange jokes and doesn\u2019t remotely understand why me and his parents are concerned. Nor does he understand why he lost his job or why finding a job would be important. We have begged him to see a doctor and he won\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d need to. My husband used to be an extremely hard-worker, always kept up to date on cleaning the house, showered daily, and was very intelligent. We loved watching movies together and playing board games. Now he\u2019s a completely different person and I miss him so much.\n\nHis parents live in another state and the only reason they came here this past week was because I told them I was becoming very concerned. When they visited they agreed that something is wrong, and as the visit progressed they started to suspect, as I do, that despite my partner\u2019s mental health history, this may be something more than a psychiatric problem. It is genuinely hard to describe unless you interact with him, but to us his behavior may indicate something is neurologically, or possibly hormonally, wrong beyond mental illness.\n\nI have reached a point where I have no idea what to do. I have been googling advice and everything tells me either 1) do nothing bc he can make his own decisions, even though I don\u2019t think he\u2019s mentally well enough to do so, or 2) have him admitted to a psych hospital. I am open to the 2nd option if needed, however he is not suicidal or threatening harm to himself or others so idk if it would be an option and regardless, I really think he should be given a full medical evaluation before defaulting to psychiatric hospitalization. But I also don\u2019t know if I would be able to have him admitted to a regular hospital since this may not be an \u201cemergency.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m panicking at this point y\u2019all. It\u2019s hard to work, hard to sleep, hard to eat. And financially we\u2019re hurting. I am so afraid I\u2019m not only losing my husband as a partner, but that he could possibly be really sick. His parents are also confused about what steps to take going forward. Please, I really need advice on what, if anything, I can do to help him. Sorry if this is long or confusing, I\u2019m frazzled at this point.",

Recovery was uncomplicated, and I am happy with the results. Life changing, truly! \n\nHowever. I\u2019m experiencing some new pain and it\u2019s making really anxious. \n\nEarly last week I noticed my right breast was tender. I had purchased new bras (first that were not surgical bras or soft bralettes) and was wearing one that day. I assumed maybe it was too compressing, so took it off after a few hours and assumed that would resolve it. \n\nHow we the pain has persisted, with varying degrees of intensity for well over a week now. The breast looks and feels the same. No noticeable lumps or puckering. Just extremely extremely tender and sore to the touch to the point where my arm brushing against it can really hurt. Sleeping on my side can hurt. Hugging my daughter can hurt. Even bending over to tie my shoe. Bending over naked in the shower hurts. \n\nThis is not the zapping nerve pain I have experience on and off in my recovery. It\u2019s more like an extremely tender, sometimes somewhat burning sensation inside my breast that can be triggered by external touch or pressure. It also sometimes just hurts on its on. \n\nI have also recently been experiencing daily headaches but that might be unrelated. I have no other current issues other than on and off iron deficiency anemia.  I occasionally take prescribed stimulants for adhd. I had a clear mammogram and breast u/s in spring 2022. \n\nI have phoned my surgeons office and they are going to see me next week, I\u2019d just really like to be prepared with how concerning this might be. The pain is awful and has really degraded by quality of life these past 10 or so days. \n\nI\u2019d love any and all input or insight. \n\nThank you.",

Sometimes a decrease in WBC can be due to medication use (i.e antibiotics, antihistamines, autoimmune drugs, antacids), poor nutrition, vitamin deficiency, viral illness or anemia. This level will typically return to normal, but in severely and persistently low WBC, this can be related to infection, autoimmune disorders, or malignancy, and warrants follow-up care.  \nPlease schedule a Health Services/Blood Draw Only visit in one month with us to draw blood and recheck your complete blood count and a blood smear. I want to make sure any abnormal levels do not persist or warrant further evaluation.

(Carotid/brain/ear vascular issues)\n**About Me:** 39F, 5'7\" 122lbs, white\n\n**Medical Diagnoses:** Costochondritis (mild, comes and goes), major depression, OCD\n\n**Current Medications:** Prozac 20mg (started only a month ago), Xanax 0.5mg as needed\n\n**Current Supplements:** Vitamin D, Vitamin C, fish oil, CoQ10, Lipo Flavanoids (started a few days ago just to see if they help)\n\n**Lifestyle:** Never smoked, drink on occasion (only drink one when I do), active/exercise regularly\n\n**Primary Complaint:** Constant 24/7 high-pitched hissing tinnitus that is sometimes pulsatile. The constant tinnitus is in both ears, though the left ear is often louder and sometimes has an additional tone.\n\n**Details about the pulsatile tinnitus:** The tinnitus is usually constant, but becomes pulsatile when I:\n\n* **Bend over** \\- I'll get about 5 seconds of pulse-synchronous whooshing in both ears. It's not a low-pitched ultrasound noise, it's like my hissing tinnitus pulsing along to my heart (ssssSSSSsssSSSssSSSsssSSS)\n* **Stand up quickly** \\- Again, about 5 seconds of pulse-synchronous whooshing in both ears\n* **Turn my head all the way to the right** \\- Same, about 5 seconds of the whooshing\n\nIf I maintain the positions above, after the 5-ish seconds, the pulsing stops and the tinnitus hisses normally, non-pulsatile.\n\nOther times it is pulsatile is doing hard cardio **exercise**... this is when it pulses the most, I hear 3-5 seconds of whooshing (both ears) on every other exhale when my heart rate is raised and pumping hard. Otherwise, I feel GREAT when I exercise, my heart rate recovers quickly when I stop, no headaches or weakness, etc.\n\nSometimes, I hear the pulsing inside my tinnitus when I first wake up in the morning, or when I wake up from a vivid dream. This can sometimes take a little while to calm down and is sometimes louder in the left ear.\n\nThe constant tinnitus is extremely somatic. I can make it louder by turning my head to the right, bending my neck all the way back, pushing on my forehead, jutting my jaw out, etc. I can even 'fake' the exact sound it makes when it's actually pulse-synchronous by doing these movements... the sound is the same.\n\n**The weirdest thing:** during the times the tinnitus is pulsing, I can STOP the pulsing by closing my teeth together. I CANNOT stop the pulsing by pressing anywhere on my neck or throat (I know that's a common test for vascular PT) I also cannot make a recording of the pulsing, which tells me it is probably a subjective noise and not 'real'.\n\n**Duration of Complaint:** 2-3 years, I don't know exactly, but it's been going on for quite a long time.\n\n**Factors to Consider:** I have a history of going to air shows and concerts without ear protection. I also used to work wedding receptions. For the last several years I have been using AirPods on my 6-7 mile daily walks, and I definitely had the music up way too loud to hear over traffic/outside noise. I know this is why I have the constant tinnitus. What I don't understand is why it is sometimes pulsatile. I protect my hearing now.\n\n**Tests I have had:**\n\n* **Brain MRI, with and without contrast, with IAC protocol:** totally clear and 'normal'\n* **Blood tests:** not anemic, liver and kidney function fine, thyroid levels are normal. Vitamin levels were not tested.\n* **Blood Pressure:** runs low if anything, has never been elevated when measured\n* **Hearing Test:** All thresholds normal, symmetrical hearing, including some extended high frequencies tested\n* **LDL/Tympanometry:** Normal LDLs and normal pressures\n* **Vestibular tests:** found a slight unilateral hypofunction on the RIGHT side, which is my 'better' tinnitus ear.. test was done to diagnose 24/7 rocking dizziness for a few months post-COVID infection. I've since 'compensated' for this and no longer feel dizzy.\n* **Chest CTA/EKG/Echocardiogram:** These were done last month because of a bad septic pneumonia infection, not because of the pulsatile tinnitus, but everything was perfect so I'm including it here just to mention that there probably isn't a cardiac concern.\n* **Eye Exam:** included digital images of my optic nerves, no papilledema seen\n\nI never cared about the noise before until I started being anxious about it, but now it causes me a great deal of anxiety and I listen to it constantly. I feel like I can habituate to it again if I could remove the anxiety that something is really wrong, since Googling 'pulsatile tinnitus' leads you down some scary rabbit holes, which is why I started seeking a doctor to begin with.\n\nI've been seeing an ENT/Neurotologist specialist, who I thought would be the best person for this due to his hyper-specialty but he seems unconcerned about my specific symptoms? I had to push for even the standard contrast brain MRI. He thinks if my PT was anything super concerning it would only ever appear in one ear and would be a more constant 24/7 thing.\n\nI think all of you doctors on here are so generous with your time and expertise, and I'm hoping you can give me some basic advice... **with my specific symptoms should I just put this to rest, or should I be seeking more scans ( brain MRA or carotid ultrasound?) And how urgently should I be seeking this out?**\n\nI'm not really trying to hunt down a cause for the PT, but I DO want to make sure that there's nothing dangerous going on.\n\nI'm really, really struggling with the anxiety. It's led me to restart Prozac after saying, years ago, that I'd never go back on another SSRI.\n\n(edited to include eye exam info, fixed typos)",

Jesus Christ this is horrible and I really need some medical advice\nSo I (22F) was fine and normal until a couple days ago\u2026.I live in New York and a couple days ago, the air quality increased badly. I did not know this until I was already outside. The humidity was terrible and I myself was wondering why the air felt so bad. When I came back inside, I started to feel loopy, winded, lightheaded and kinda felt sick as well. I even got a bad headache. This is not the first time it\u2019s happened. I seem to always have similar reactions whenever I\u2019m exposed to bad air quality. After freshening up and washing my face then relaxing for a bit, all symptoms seemed to subside. \n\nBut then the next morning, I had an extremely dry throat. This was a first and has never happened before. It wasn\u2019t a soar throat at first but it felt like sand paper, parched throat, like there\u2019s ashes in the bottom. Pretty much feels like there\u2019s some rough material that\u2019s stuck at the bottom of my throat. Each morning it got worse. Until it eventually felt like I had an actual soar throat. I was able to subside the feeling throughout the day with home remedies, throat spray, etc., but each morning it always comes back in FULL FORCE. This morning was the worst of all. I am now at the stage where I\u2019m constantly coughing and it\u2019s not really about the uncomfortable feeling of a soar throat anymore. I basically got no kind of sleep\u2026.at all. Not only is there an intense tickle in my throat or very frequent ones, but I am unable to basically relax my throat. It feels like my airways are closing in and every millisecond I\u2019m coughing. It feels like there\u2019s a lump of sand paper in my throat that\u2019s blocking my ability to breathe properly and as a result, I\u2019m coughing every minute, like my airways have been narrowed down to the max. \n\nAlongside this I\u2019ve been taking antibiotics prescribed by my GI doctor and its Metronidazole. I\u2019ve had an on/off chronic cough for a couple years now and it flares up the worst whenever I get sick. I will end up having an after cough up to 2 months after being sick. It is suspected that my chronic cough may be induced by gastrointestinal issues which is why I went to see a GI specialist a couple weeks back. The point of the antibiotics is just to remove any existing bacteria that may be in my stomach. \n\nIn this specific case though, I don\u2019t feel sick. I don\u2019t have a fever or any other common cold symptoms. I\u2019m just losing a lot of sleep over this BS. So I\u2019m not sure if me having this cough is a result of being sick from the air quality or something else.\n\nI\u2019m also a little afraid that it could be the way I\u2019m taking the antibiotics? I haven\u2019t taken antibiotics in years and forgot if there\u2019s any health consequences to not taking them the right way. Sometimes I miss some days I\u2019m supposed to take it but I try to make it up the minute I remember in the next couple of days. So when taking Metronidazole, there were some gaps in my consistency of taking it properly. And because my cough was getting so bad, my mom though giving me a shot of lime, honey and rum would kill it off because of the acidity. But I don\u2019t know if it was a bad idea to take a shot with alcohol in it since I\u2019m still taking the antibiotics.\n\nI really need some help on this, any clue as to what could be going on?",

Or just something somatic?\nF28, 160 cm, 70 kg\r  \nMedication: 2x20mg omeprazole, 1 one billion unit probiotic, and 3x60 mg alverine and simethicone daily for a colitis flareup (prescribed for a month, I\u2019m starting the third week), plus 1x500 mg extended release metformin, 2 myo-inositol, 1 vitamin D supplement daily, and .025mg cabergoline weekly to treat PCOS and elevated prolactin levels (prescribed for three months before checkup, also starting the third week)\r  \n\r  \nOn January I went to a GP about another colitis flareup, my main symptoms were bloating and starting to feel some fatigue. The GP only did a physical checkup, didn\u2019t ask for blood tests or other analysis. I complained mostly about pain/discomfort on my right side, right under the ribcage, and she told me she was ruling out liver problems on the basis alone that the pain didn\u2019t worsen in the area while she was feeling around. She prescribed me a week-long treatment and I felt a lot better.\r  \n\r  \nAround May I began experiencing a lot of stress and noticed I began bloating again, but due to financial problems I could only ignore it. It worsened with time, albeit slightly, and just at the beginning of July I was able to invest in getting checkups again.\r  \n\r  \nI started with a gynecologist due to some discomfort on my breasts, which to be honest caused me to panic and stress even more over the fear of it being breast cancer, but after an ultrasound and blood test, the doctor explained it was only an increase on my prolactin levels, a vitamin D deficiency and a couple of hormones having inverted values, as well as my insulin resistance flaring up again. I must admit I spent almost everyday at home until very recently, and my diet is/was not the best, so the vitamin D deficiency didn\u2019t really come as a surprise (from a baseline of =<30, I had 9.43). Still, the almost three-week waiting period raised up hell in my already uncomfortable gut.\r  \n\r  \nI took those blood work results to a gastroenterologist in case they were useful to her, since I read that vitamin D and prolactin are metabolized through the liver, but she disregarded them quickly. My symptoms were the same as the ones in January: I was uncomfortably bloated, spicy and greasy foods, which I had been honestly abusing lately, weren\u2019t sitting right with me and I had occasional diarrhea, although with no blood on sight. I also felt discomfort on my right side, right under my ribcage, again. During the physical checkup she also semi-ruled out liver problems, but still asked for a liver and bile duct ultrasound and a 32-element blood work to make sure.\r  \n\r  \nThe ultrasound report says: \"Moderate grade fatty liver, cholelithiasis without bile duct dilation\", and recommended to check certain values, which are as follows (I\u2019ll include the lab baseline values in parenthesis next to my values, since I live outside the USA and don\u2019t know if they vary):\r  \nAlbumin: 4.80 (3.97-4.94)\r  \nAlkaline phosphatase: 75.1 (35.0-104.0)\r  \nBilirubin: 0.57 (<=1.20)\r  \nALT: 32.9 (<=33.0)\r  \nAST: 21.9 (<=32.0)\r  \nGGT: 16.4 (<=40.0)\r  \n\r  \nThe ultrasound also recommended to check TP, TPT and prothrombin time, but my initial blood work didn\u2019t include it.\r  \n\r  \nThe gastroenterologist said she would let me know if it was necessary to go see her earlier when I sent my results, otherwise she would see me in a month. She only confirmed she had received my blood work and ultrasounds and didn\u2019t add anything else, so I\u2019m assuming I\u2019ll see her at the beginning of August.\r  \n\r  \nNow, starting on the third week of all the medicine I have to take, I\u2019ve noticed only small changes: I\u2019m not as bloated, but I\u2019m still bloated. I\u2019m not really feeling hungry (but I have to admit, I\u2019m also a very anxious person and normally during elevated anxiety periods I lose appetite completely). I burp after eating anything, no matter how little it is (for example, I burped after having two peach gummies the other day). My bowel movements go from slight constipation to slight diarrhea and they are consistently a soft brown color (I wouldn\u2019t call it clay-colored, but it\u2019s definitely lighter than my normal bowel movements). The general discomfort under my right ribcage has improved considerably, although when I get nervous/anxious I feel it. But now, every now and then, I feel little, very defined stabby pains in that area, instead of just general discomfort/ache. I would describe them as someone poking me with a sharp object. The pain lasts a few seconds at most and then goes away, but it leaves me scared. I\u2019m also sometimes dizzy and slightly nauseous, but haven\u2019t really thrown up during the treatment (and even before that, in a long time).\r  \n\r  \nNow, the thing is I don\u2019t know if these could be gallbladder attacks or the fatty liver acting up. Even if I go to sleep feeling those discomforts, I always wake up without them. Sometimes symptoms start shortly after waking up, but I\u2019ve noticed that happens only on days when I\u2019m feeling overtly-anxious and obsessively scanning my body.

        "context": "Sinus pressure on palate after jaw surgery\nHi all,\n\nI am currently 32, male.  I am obese and take medications for blood pressure and anxiety.  I was born with an underbite and crossbite and so at approx. age 25 I started a two part orthognathic surgical process to correct this.  The first surgery, a SARPE (surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion) was uneventful, but the bone-borne palatal expander that was implanted in the roof of my mouth fractured a week after surgery (while being activated via the wrench provided) and was prematurely removed, while the doctors maintained the transverse width that I had achieved to that point and move forward with orthodontics in preparation for the second surgery.  The second surgery, a Le Fort I osteotomy, advanced the maxilla forward.  I then had several additional months of orthodontics.\n\nAfter the braces were removed it was clear that my crossbite remained, likely as a result of inadequate expansion of the maxilla because of the palatal expander failure.  I was recommended for a revision surgery which I had done in 2019.  The new surgeon removed the hardware (plates and screws) from the Le Fort I osteotomy and repeated the SARPE procedure from scratch.  \n\nAfter this repeat SARPE surgery, the upper right quadrant of teeth either shifted downward entirely or the teeth erupted downward and I suffered root resorption and gum recession on almost all right side maxillary as a result.  I also developed a burning sensation in the right side of the hard palate, and a sensation of fullness/inflation when I breathe through my nose.  If I perform a Valsalva maneuver and breathe into my nose I feel air pressure on almost all teeth on the right side of the maxilla (and not the left), and it feels as if something is \"inflating\" between my right-side hard palate/teeth and the floor of my right nostril.  Additionally, if I shift my mandible left to right it activates a sort of suction/popping that is both clearly audible but also felt in those same areas of the palate/nasal floor.  I do not believe this popping is coming from the jaw joints (TMJ).\n\nA recent CT scan at my periodontist showed fluid in the right maxillary sinus, but other than that my jaw surgeon (who did the revision) has offered no explanation, and neither has any orthodontist or the periodontist himself.  The periodontist has recommended seeing an ENT which I am doing next month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestions: \n\n1. Why did the right side of my maxilla/those teeth shift downward after the revision SARPE procedure?\n2. Why did the gums recede on those teeth at the same time as the downward shift?\n3. What is going on with the air pressure/popping/clicking in the palate/nasal floor?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy jaw surgeon has shrugged off my complaints and it has made me feel powerless over my own health.  Any advice is sincerely appreciated.",

She is generally a very active person( runs every morning, has completed marathons in the past) and leads a healthy lifestyle. Social drinker. It will be long but I would deeply appreciate some insight here.\n\nMedical history: \n\n-At 15 she experienced 2 sudden and unexplained tonic clonic seizures about 2 months apart. She was still seeing a neurologist when I began seeing her 8 years ago, and taking Keppra daily. She has had one brain MRI and two EEGs all clear. She never had any other 'loss of consciousness' seizures again, but did experience an episode once about 5 years ago where she suddenly while watching TV Island folding laundry in the evening where she became very pale and clammy, expressed she needed to sit, and then it was as if she lost muscle tone. She was conscious throughout this and I would say it lasted maybe 2 minutes total. She brushed it off as anxiety.\nAfter her second EEG and with no further issues she was weaned off the anticonvulsant at 25(3 years ago) no issues since.\n\n-2 uncomplicated vaginal births.\n\n-uses zoloft and escitalopram for anxiety and major depressive disorder. Has struggled on and off in short occasional periods since teens. \n\nIn the last year I have noticed my fiance physically and mentally change. \n\nShe has suffered from the odd migraine for as long as I've known her. She had discussed it with her prior neurologist and she didn't have them frequently enough to be considered chronic migraine. They were more the odd annoyance and she knew the triggers to avoid.\n\nShe started having them frequently. There have been 2 episodes in the last month where she has literally broke down in tears and told me she can't take it anymore. She says its the one sided behind the eye throbbing. It is very easy to tell she is in a lot of pain. I tried to convince her to go to the ER because I was concerned but she was adamant that's wasting their time and it would pass. Both times she ended up taking ibuprofen, trying to lay down, vomiting, then reporting the throbbing was a bit better and then she went go right to sleep.\n\nShe is extremely fatigued this last 6 months or so to the point she could easily sleep all day and never feel rested. She complains often that her joints are achy and sore and its just easy to tell shes uncomfortable physically a lot of the time.   She goes to physical therapy but doesn't seem to help much . \n\nShe has more frequent bowel movements/ trips to bathroom in general and complains of stomach pain and frequent diarrhea.\n\nStruggling with dry blotchy skin, rashes and acne.\n\nLately when I talk to her I notice strange things. There have been a few times now she has lost her train of thought in conversation. And no it's not like she blanks and has an absence seizure or something. She will stutter, repeat a word, or get stuck. It's like she's aware too but can't control it. She definitely has some brain fog going on. \n\nToday she had an episode where she went to pass me a cup and then gave me a weird look. I asked her what was wrong and she told me she couldn't 'let go' and it hurt. It was super weird I could tell how tense her arm had become. It was like the muscle tightened, then let go. This was definitely not something she was voluntary doing. The way her muscle suddenly tensed (20 seconds or so) and softened was strange. Only the arm and no other twitches or movement.\n\nShe feels nauseous and dizzy a lot and I just feel in my gut that something is not right and I can't chalk it up to depression like I could at first. I feel like she is drastically physically changing and looking unwell rapidly. She has lost 10-15 lbs over the last few months but she has always had a petite build. She's so damn stubborn she says because all of her blood work is good there can't possibly be anything wrong, and that her symptoms are vague and not uncommon. \n\nI realize you can't give me a medical opinion based on what minimal information I have given you here but am I going crazy? Necause I'm starting to question if I'm reading too much into it and developing health anxiety about her (No history of anxiety here BTW lol) \n\nIf you were a doctor and someone presented to you with similar issues would you be concerned or have suspicions? I just want her to take this seriously and press for more than blood work. ( she has had cbc, thyroid, iron, glucose, liver, CRP all basic blood work done and all perfect)\n\nAny advice or opinions to maybe help her take it seriously would be appreciated. Thank you",

I assume it\u2019s from all the mild trauma initiated by digital insertion, enemas, and occasional anal sexual activity (see below) but don\u2019t know for sure.\r  \n\\-I do \u201cbottom\u201d and use anal sex toys a few times a year and have done so since my early teens, but I frequently avoid such activities due to my GI issues.\r  \n\r  \nSorry for the long-winded post, but I have a physical w/ my PCP next month and hope to have some suggestions of what to explore/tell her and maybe some advice of what I can do on my own to help. This has been a major and shameful struggle in my life for well over a decade now, and I just want it to go away. Thank you in advance!\r  \n",

        "context": "Facial pain / osteoma (26m)\nHi guys. I\u2019ve had this chronic pain on the left hand side between my nose/sinus/teeth for years. The dentist ruled out a dental cause and suggested seeing an ENT.\n\nI had a scan done and the ENT said there was \u2018white\u2019 on the region of the scan and he didn\u2019t know what it was. So he referred me to another ENT department he thought could help.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t access his scan and to my recollection they ordered another one. They told me that they found an osteoma at the exact location of my pain, however they don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for an osteoma to cause facial pain. So they referred me to a pain clinic who said it was \u2018idiopathic facial pain\u2019 and probably neurological in origin. They said my best bet was seeing a \u2018pain psychologist\u2019 and taking nerve pain medication (which hasn\u2019t helped at all).\n\nI felt I wanted a second opinion on the osteoma and the pain, and finally got seen again by the ENT. They stated they couldn\u2019t access either of my scans, and had no record of the second scan and that it probably \u2018didn\u2019t happen\u2019 (it did). Nonetheless, he still was adamant that the osteoma couldn\u2019t cause facial pain and that pain psychology was the only treatment.\n\nNow, every study I have read states that sinus osteomas can and often do cause facial pain.\n\n\u2018The most common symptom of paranasal osteomas is pain including headache and facial pain (Atallah and Jay, 1981).\u2019 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319453411001044#:~:text=The%20clinical%20presentation%20of%20paranasal,Atallah%20and%20Jay%2C%201981).\n\nIt seems bizarre to me that there would be an osteoma at the exact location of the pain that\u2019s unrelated. What\u2019s even more bizarre to me is being told it can\u2019t cause facial pain when every study says it does.\n\nNow I\u2019m not certain this is the cause of the pain. However it confused me. Furthermore, I am not happy with the idiopathic/nerve diagnosis. They arrived at that from simply not finding another cause, and it really doesn\u2019t feel like a nerve problem to me (it feels very structural/physical, largely affected by pressure, I can feel/hear liquid/fluid opening closing etc).\n\nThey have stated they are going to try and locate the past scan, however that was from 4 years ago. I will pursue a new scan, but i am not convinced of whether the response will be any better.\n\nAny thoughts or advice would be useful!\n\nThanks",

I live in Southern California, I am a 5'7\" 140lb 27 Y/O Male who is very athletic. I eat clean, I exercise regularly, and take multivitamins. \n\nI was two months into the Sheriff academy when on the weekend of June 10th 2023 I got sick. Headache, nausea, chest congestion and an overall feeling of exhaustion. I've been sick before, so this wasn't alarming. I was coughing up yellow/green phlegm that following week, and was trying to dial it down but the intensity of the sheriff academy, my pride, and pushy instructors who don't \"allow you\" to be sick got the better of me, and I trained through it. Over the next few week I felt off but generally okay, all symptoms had subsided except I was coughing up green phlegm still, and I felt like I was operating at 70% capacity. I was still running 7-9 Miles at a 7 Minute flat pace, but I felt terrible doing it. At this time I was living in barracks housing, which was old, dirty, and there was mold present in some areas. \n\nFast forward a few weeks, I choose to remove myself from the academy for a variety of reasons, my wife and daughter needed me at home, my daughter is autistic and being away for weeks at a time was too hard on her, I was still sick, and ultimately I felt the job wasn't for me. Still coughing up green phlegm on Jun 26th I went to urgent care. The Physician I saw said I probably have bronchitis and prescribed the following:\n\ndoxycycline (MONODOX) 100 MG capsule (2 a day for 10 days)\r  \nalbuterol 108 (90 Base) MCG/ACT inhaler\r  \nmethylprednisolone (MEDROL DOSEPACK) 4 MG tablet (6-5-4-3-2-1 daily doses)\n\nI took 9 days worth of the antibiotic, but it was making me feel worse, and I skipped the last dose the 10th day. I took the steroid, as directed, with the exception of one day where I missed one of the four doses. \n\nAfter all that, I developed bad sinus pressure and nasal congestion, and the chest congestion was still present. I don't have the urge to cough, but when I exhale hard and deep, or \"Huff\" I can hear the crackling and can cough up the green mucus. Usually by the afternoon I feel halfway decent and most of my congestion has eased. But the next day I start all over again; plugged nose, green mucus, chest congestion, face pressure. I live at elevation and when I drive down the hill for work I get plugged up, ear pain, and sinus pressure. OTC stuff doesn't seem to help.\n\nI went back to the same urgent care on 7/14, the PA who saw me essentially told me to continue waiting it out, was very dismissive of me, and reluctantly ordered chest and sinus X-Rays of which I am still awaiting results.\n\nUltimately, as of today I am still sick, closing in on 40 days straight of CRAP! I have never been sick for this long in my entire life. Am I overthinking it? Do I just keep waiting? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nANY ADVICE IS GREATLY APPRECIATED, and I will promptly answer any questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks\n\n&#x200B;",

I have immediate family history of heart attacks so I try to be good about getting bloodwork etc. \n\nWent to a cardiologist today for high cholesterol, and when listening to my heart said he thinks I may have a very slight murmur.

I was undergoing testing for sleep disorders roughly 1 year ago, but stopped the testing/cancelled appointments due to developing a terrible fear of hospitals (MS diagnosis related- I know it was silly of me). At the point I ended testing, sleep apnea had been ruled out. But nothing else had been tested yet.

If I didn't have responsibilities I could sleep longer as I don't seem to have the 'wake up' urge that everyone else has. \n\n-I struggle to tell the difference between dreams and real life.

Pathology identified this as early balanitis xerotica obliterans. The most pressing concern for me was the increased sensitivity causing premature ejaculation, which I have never experienced before. After many visits to my PCP, a dermatologist, and two unsatisfying urologists, a family friend recommended a urologist who was compassionate and attentive. Since my condition was not improving, we decided circumcision was the best option. I underwent the procedure May 9. I now come to reddit with two concerns.\n\nFirst: it has been over two months since my surgery and I am still experiencing redness and irritation along the surgical scar. The increased sensitivity is still causing premature ejaculation during intercourse and pain in the area after sex.  It's also just generally sensitive and hurts if I pull on the shaft of my penis. I followed up with my urologist at the beginning of July, he says it appeared to be healing well. However, I am concerned that things are not going back to normal as expected. Is this healing timeline to be expected post circumcision?\n\nSecond: after my stitches dissolved and swelling began to subside, I noticed that the \"seam\" underneath the length of my penis was no longer centered. It seems when sewing everything up, they stitched things back together about a quarter inch rotated off center. Now the \"seam\" doesn't line up with where my frenulum was. Is this possible? Is this something I should be concerned about, and is it worth bringing up to my urologist who performed the surgery? Other than appearance it doesn't seem to be affecting the functionality in any way.",

Turns out that all of my issues I had during pregnancy, the cause of my son\u2019s stillbirth, and my chest pain and dizziness were all a result of Rheumatic Heart Disease.\n\nI ended up having a stroke and I thought that would change my urgency of care, but still I was dismissed by all of my providers. My cardiologist was very condescending and said my issues, specifically worsening issues, such as extreme chest pain, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, feeling a cold fluid feeling in my chest, my swollen abdomen and feet, and a hard cough, were just the result of stress and anxiety. I asked for an updated echocardiogram since I had one last year and much has change with my symptoms. I was denied and said an echo was absolutely not needed in my case. \n\nI went to my primary care who was also condescending and said it was anxiety. At the point of anger and tears I told her I felt like I\u2019m dying and I needed help. She said she was not a cardiologist but if it would help me feel better she would order an echocardiogram at the local hospital. \n\nMonday I had the echo. Wednesday I was diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease affecting both the mitral and tricuspid valves. There is still no urgency from my care team. I\u2019m being ignored by my PCP. My cardiologist gave a half-hearted \u201cwe\u2019ll request the echo records\u201d when I called them. I feel even worse. My chest pain now only ends when I feel a burst of fluid that feels like it fills my chest and neck. I\u2019m having trouble breathing all the time. But if I have a feeling if I traveled to the ER again, I\u2019d be dismissed right away just like I was before in pregnancy and earlier postpartum. I\u2019ve had this chest pain for months and especially when I was pregnant but for all the 6 times I went to Labor and Delivery I was discharged right away and never given an EKG or any cardiac work up. Same with my OB. \n\nSeparately, I\u2019m seeing a neurologist for my TIA. He\u2019s found something doing an EEG and multiple MRIs. He won\u2019t tell me the results until my follow up on 2 weeks but told me I absolutely cannot work or drive. \n\nI\u2019m truly at a loss of what to do. If I call the office I get attitude from both the nurses and receptionists. I can\u2019t even find good information on this disease because it seems like it\u2019s not common in developed countries. I live in the US, I\u2019m upper-middle class, I have always taken my full course of antibiotics when I\u2019ve had strep. I just don\u2019t understand how of the thousands and thousands of dollars I\u2019ve spent trying to get help over the past few months all I have to show for it is a permanent heart condition, a dead child, and no plan moving forward.",

She is generally a very active person( runs every morning, has completed marathons in the past) and leads a healthy lifestyle. Social drinker. It will be long but I would deeply appreciate some insight here.\n\nMedical history: \n\n-At 15 she experienced 2 sudden and unexplained tonic clonic seizures about 2 months apart. She was still seeing a neurologist when I began seeing her 8 years ago, and taking Keppra daily. She has had one brain MRI and two EEGs all clear. She never had any other 'loss of consciousness' seizures again, but did experience an episode once about 5 years ago where she suddenly while watching TV Island folding laundry in the evening where she became very pale and clammy, expressed she needed to sit, and then it was as if she lost muscle tone. She was conscious throughout this and I would say it lasted maybe 2 minutes total. She brushed it off as anxiety.\nAfter her second EEG and with no further issues she was weaned off the anticonvulsant at 25(3 years ago) no issues since.\n\n-2 uncomplicated vaginal births.\n\n-uses zoloft and escitalopram for anxiety and major depressive disorder. Has struggled on and off in short occasional periods since teens. \n\nIn the last year I have noticed my fiance physically and mentally change. \n\nShe has suffered from the odd migraine for as long as I've known her. She had discussed it with her prior neurologist and she didn't have them frequently enough to be considered chronic migraine. They were more the odd annoyance and she knew the triggers to avoid.\n\nShe started having them frequently. There have been 2 episodes in the last month where she has literally broke down in tears and told me she can't take it anymore. She says its the one sided behind the eye throbbing. It is very easy to tell she is in a lot of pain. I tried to convince her to go to the ER because I was concerned but she was adamant that's wasting their time and it would pass. Both times she ended up taking ibuprofen, trying to lay down, vomiting, then reporting the throbbing was a bit better and then she went go right to sleep.\n\nShe is extremely fatigued this last 6 months or so to the point she could easily sleep all day and never feel rested. She complains often that her joints are achy and sore and its just easy to tell shes uncomfortable physically a lot of the time.   She goes to physical therapy but doesn't seem to help much . \n\nShe has more frequent bowel movements/ trips to bathroom in general and complains of stomach pain and frequent diarrhea.\n\nStruggling with dry blotchy skin, rashes and acne.\n\nLately when I talk to her I notice strange things. There have been a few times now she has lost her train of thought in conversation. And no it's not like she blanks and has an absence seizure or something. She will stutter, repeat a word, or get stuck. It's like she's aware too but can't control it. She definitely has some brain fog going on. \n\nToday she had an episode where she went to pass me a cup and then gave me a weird look. I asked her what was wrong and she told me she couldn't 'let go' and it hurt. It was super weird I could tell how tense her arm had become. It was like the muscle tightened, then let go. This was definitely not something she was voluntary doing. The way her muscle suddenly tensed (20 seconds or so) and softened was strange. Only the arm and no other twitches or movement.\n\nShe feels nauseous and dizzy a lot and I just feel in my gut that something is not right and I can't chalk it up to depression like I could at first. I feel like she is drastically physically changing and looking unwell rapidly. She has lost 10-15 lbs over the last few months but she has always had a petite build. She's so damn stubborn she says because all of her blood work is good there can't possibly be anything wrong, and that her symptoms are vague and not uncommon. \n\nI realize you can't give me a medical opinion based on what minimal information I have given you here but am I going crazy? Necause I'm starting to question if I'm reading too much into it and developing health anxiety about her (No history of anxiety here BTW lol) \n\nIf you were a doctor and someone presented to you with similar issues would you be concerned or have suspicions? I just want her to take this seriously and press for more than blood work. ( she has had cbc, thyroid, iron, glucose, liver, CRP all basic blood work done and all perfect)\n\nAny advice or opinions to maybe help her take it seriously would be appreciated. Thank you",

I would poop an ok looking log, but it felt more was in there that did not want to come out.\n\nWednesday night I could feel bloating and that poop was backing up.  This happened again Thursday with my morning poop not getting everything to come out.\n\nI have been eating healthy, exercising, and loss a bunch of weight this year.  I cut out all Alcohol, candy, soda, junk food, milk, ice cream, and really revamped my whole diet to be healthy.  I don't smoke, do drugs, or on any kind of medication.   I try to keep good gut health drinking kombucha for the probiotics and all that stuff.\n\nRecently in the last few weeks I've been concentrating on eating more fiber to bulk up my poops a little bit more as I felt they were a touch loose.  I may have over did it as this may have caused my constipation as I was not drinking enough liquids to offset the increase in fiber.\n\nA side effect of this constipation seems to be the need to pee often, though when I pee not a lot comes out.  This usually happens at night after dinner and gets worst while I'm trying to sleep.  It's to the point that I'm try to pee, I feel like I'm done, go back to bed and 5 minutes later I have the I need to pee feeling again.\n\nSo I was talking with a friend yesterday about my constipation and they said a salt cleanse helped them in the past to get things moving.  So I read up on that yesterday and it seemed simple enough to try.  I did it first thing this morning and boy did lots of poop and sludge come out.\n\nI probably pooped water on and off for 30 minutes. At the end the water was pretty clear so I felt like it did it's job.  I did instantly feel better the rest of the morning.  I ate a egg and avocado sandwich for lunch, 5 hours after pooping water, to keep things light and have drank lots of water and a Kombucha today to rehydrate for all that lost water.\n\nOne thing in particular is the need to pee often with not much coming out has not gone away. I have had that pretty much all afternoon and still have it now as I type this post.  I'm been doing some Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles the last hour and that seem to have help things a bit.\n\nI still feel like I have to pee, but it's more an annoying feeling of something in the chamber then I have to pee right now.  I'm not sure if this matter, but it's a data point.\n\nSo now one thing I did Tuesday night, that may be important, was have some bedroom fun with my girlfriend.  So now I enjoy edging and she loves taking the dominate role at times.  So on this night we went at it where she basically controlled when and how I would cum.\n\nWe got to a point where I was rock hard riding the edge as she was stroking me.  At one point I felt the urge to pee and I said I have to pee.  She played her dominate role and say no peeing.\n\nHonestly I kind of liked it. The urge to pee while riding the edge, felt great.  So I went with it and didn't use our safe word to stop.\n\nIf anything I felt even harder having to pee and riding the edge.  My girlfriend was loving it, even commenting how much harder I was than normal.  This lasted for at least 45 minutes before I ejaculated and my penis had this vibrating feeling that was out of this world.\n\nAt that point I still had to great urge to pee but I was rock hard from all of the stimulation.  This made peeing pretty difficult, but I pushed it out.  I will say pushing out the pee was not smooth in the sense that t was kind of stop and start peeing.   In hindsight this may have not been the best move.\n\nThough I noticed \\~15 minutes later when I was completely soft that I felt like I had to pee again.  I went and only a dribble came out.\n\nI tell you all this because that urge to pee feeling I get now, feels pretty much the same as that urge to pee after 15 minutes I just mentioned.  If I do pee more the a dribble then it's has this stop and stop feel to it as well when I try to relax the muscle holding the pee back.  I don't know if they are related or just coincidence, but I felt it was worth a note.\n\nAnyways if anybody has some advice fore getting through the weekend that would be great.  I have no idea what tomorrow will bring and if all my issues will just go away with a night of sleet, but I'm looking for an opinion / some advice.\n\nMy doctor's office did not think this was an emergency, so I should not have much to worry about, but this urge to pee is pretty annoying.   It's been a little over an hour since I last peed as the Kegel exercises I talked about above seem to setting things down.  It's more of a tingle now then an all out I have to pee.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions and I apologize for any bad grammar or spelling.  Thanks for any help.\n\n&#x200B;",

Around two months ago I started experiencing chest pain it started off low and increased in severity.

I went to the ER and the ecg was normal but the attending physician heard my heart through a stethoscope and recommended seeing a cardiologist. \n\nAfter multiple tests with the cardiologist he said I had mild moderate mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation. However, he insisted that it has nothing to do with the chest pain and it is caused by stress and anxiety. He basically told me to go and speak to a psychiatrist. This was end of May, the pain has not gone away at all. I went to another cardiologist that said the same thing. I spoke to a third cardiologist and he said to take it easy and not move much but thats about it. The problem is that this pain is becoming debilitating and because it hurts I cannot stop thinking about it. \n\nThe pain can be described as a pressure in the heart or stabbing, my arm sometimes feels numb or sore. It is sometimes accompanied by nausea and lightheadedness as well as fatigue.

I went to the dentist and all they did was give my teeth a clean. This actually helped with the sensitivity. However, over the next two years, I recognized that every time I would wake up in the morning, my mouth was very sour still. During this same time, my mouth would also become quite sour immediately after eating (I'm talking minutes or sometimes seconds after even just eating a snack). \n\n  \nThe most alarming aspect of all of this though, was how I noticed that my teeth were seemingly eroding away: my canine teeth and premolars especially were getting increasingly shaper in angle (look more like a shark with how pointy they have become). Additionally, the spaces between my teeth are now much larger: before this period, it was slightly difficult to fit my dental floss between each tooth but now there is so much space so that there is no difficulty in fitting the floss between each tooth, highlighting the wear. \n\n  \nWith all this in mind, I was confident that I had acid reflux/GERD/GORD. I went to my dentist who was unsure if this actually was acid reflux but was more confident in this being bruxism (grinding). They made a night guard and told me to see if it gets worse. My erosion did get more noticeable and the sour taste was still there. \n\n  \nThus, I went to see a gastroenterologist who, over the course of a year, carried out a 24 hour pH test and then a 48 hour BRAVO pH test to see if I really did have acid reflux. These two tests showed that I likely did not have acid reflux. However, before these two tests, the gastroenterologist prescribed me with omeprazole (20mg, which didn't work for long before upping this up to 40mg). I have been on this 40mg dose ever since (just before bed as I normally wake up with a very sour taste and I have noticed that my teeth wear away the most over night), despite these negative GERD indications.\n\n  \nI also then went to see an oral specialist and told her my experience about how eating a Gaviscon antacid tablet is helpful in getting rid of the sour taste that I experience immediately after eating. They said if the Gaviscon helps, it probably is a stomach issue and that she cannot help with that. She then sent me to do some bloods which returned all normal except very low zinc levels, but I'm not sure if that's related.\n\n  \nNow, I am extremely anxious and confused about what I should do. I do think I have acid reflux because besides from the symptoms i've mentioned beforehand, the back of my throat does also feel more sensitive and irritable, especially with spicy food. There is no question that my teeth are not in good shape, and definitely not like how they were before this whole period of experiencing sourness began. \n\n  \nPlease, can someone give me a possible explanation for what has been happening and what I can do about this?  \n",

My father also has high BP, spoke with a co-worker a year ago who has been taking Mukta Vati ([this exact one\\)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O0R9S9I/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for a few years and it's eliminated the need for Rx. Dad consulted with his PCP, they were aware and supported trying it, it's been effective for him for the last 6-12 months for him. He was able to get off at least one of his meds per his doc now that he uses it. I like the concept of a more natural remedy, but curious to know thoughts? I'm also going to ask my PCP, but I'm curious if anyone has experiences. Side effects seem very minimal if applicable (congestion, upset stomach, maybe nausea).[ Another formulation seems to have Acorus calamus which some googling has shown is a possible carcinogen,](https://www.amazon.com/Divya-Mukta-Vati-120-Tablets/dp/B00MFY3RQS) but the [one that my father takes and that I am interested in](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O0R9S9I/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) doesn't seem to include that from all the searching I can find.\n\nThank you for your time!",

My question is, how exactly does constipation happen in the bowels? If my son takes high enough doses of stool softeners and laxatives, he'll have one or two mushy poops per day. If he misses a dose or gets a smaller dose, the next day he will still poop, but it will be hard and small. The next day pebbles, and the day after that, he stops pooping altogether. When he gets back on the laxatives, he will go back and forth between pooping water and pooping pebbles until his stool gets back to normal consistency & frequency. \n\nHow could he go from soft wet poops to hard poops within a day? Wouldn't it need to be in his colon longer to get that hard? Does it mean that too much water is being pulled from his intestines? He doesn't seem dehydrated - he wets diapers well, has a wet mouth, cries tears, and drinks water all day long as well as milk bottles. He also eats lots of fiber. \n\nThank you! ",

All of this has been accompanied by migraines or headaches as well. \nI\u2019m tired of feeling like garbage all the time but I keep getting told it\u2019s anxiety or my weight. Please give me something else. \n\nFigured I\u2019d mention that I also had an MRI done due to a high prolactin level (35) which has gone back down to 8. They wanted the MRI to check for a prolactinoma. I had a full brain scan as well as a pituitary scan and it was clean.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention. Also have been constipated for a good 3 weeks. I noticed on the 4th that I hadn\u2019t really been going much. Since then, same thing. Small amounts, always hard and unproductive. Drank 10oz of magnesium citrate two days ago, went a good amount up until like 6 last night. It lasted about 24 hours, but a vast majority of my BMs were pretty much clear. Like where is the stuff from the last 3 weeks?? Very confusing.",

Maybe I should go back to the Scopolamine patches 24/7.\r  \n\r  \n**Medications that did not help:**\r  \n\rPercocet\r  \n\r  \nTramadol\r  \n\r  \nFioricet\r  \n\r  \nNurtec\r  \n\r  \nQulipta\r  \n\r  \nAmlodipine\r  \n\r  \nTheophylline\r  \n\r  \nRizatriptan\r  \n\r  \nSumatriptan\r  \n\r  \nPepcid AC\r  \n\r  \nZyrtec\r  \n\r  \nMagnesium\r  \n\r  \nAdvil, Tylenol, Meloxicam, caffeine - didn't help but gave me rebound headaches\r  \n\r  \nTENS machine didn't help but maybe I should try it again. I was really trying to push it to the max I could tolerate but from what i've been reading (yea it hurts so bad I go back reading over the same old stuff hoping I find something I missed) thats really not the way to use it.\r  \n\r  \nEffexor - felt like a headache shift. If I had to guess I would say it helped my migraines but made the serotonin headaches worse (it was before adderall)\r  \n\r  \nmedial branch block c2:c3 - the procedure hurt insanely badly until the next day and they only injected a medicine that would numb occipital neuralgia for 2 hours **so I have no idea if it worked or not**. It seems like they should have anticipated I would be unable to articulate the different extreme pains so close to each other in the back of my head/neck.\r  \n\r  \n**A few more relevant notes:**\r  \n\r  \nI had a brain MRI, its fine. I had a neck MRI, they said I have some problems but they should not be bad enough to be causing any of my headaches:\r  \n\r  \nStraightening of cervical lordosis.\r  \n\r  \nMultilevel mild degenerative disc disease changes at C3-C7 with multilevel mild canal stenosis. There is no disc protrusion or cord compression.\r  \n\r  \nMild diffuse facet degenerative changes as described. I passed the caloric stimulation test but i do have tinnitus.\r  \n\r  \n**Trigger Point Injection day was frigging awesome**. For 2 hours I felt like a normal person. They said the fact that it was only 2 hours meant it failed. They said I had to be responding to the numbing medicine (Bupivacaine HCl (MARCAINE)) and not the real medicine they shot in there (triamcinolone acetonide (KENALOG-40)).\r  \n\r  \n**It looks like there are a lot of possibilities for what the remaining headache could be:**\r  \n\r  \nwhiplash damage - someone was driving a truck in the rain without windshield wipers and I was stopped at a red light. he hit me doing about 45 without trying to slow down at all because he couldnt see in the rain but that was 15 years ago and this has only been a problem for half that long\r  \n\r  \ncervicogenic headache - because its not a throbbing pain and the diagram showing pain from the top half the neck to the top of the head is perfect for me most of the time. But I went to physical therapy 8 times and a chiropractor 6 times.\r  \n\r  \nCraniocervical Instability - was suggested last time but the chiropractor would feel that right?\r  \n\r  \nchronic sub-occipital trigger point issues from bad posture - Another Aspie suggested this to me. Maybe we keep those flexed. I do lean my head forward an extreme amount. That is the area that hurts the most (when things are good and its not the whole back of my head this is actually the only area hurting).\r  \n\r  \nCFS leak - was suggested by the most people last time because of how much laying down for 30 minutes helps or how bad I feel shortly after getting out of bed in the morning. Laying down seems to help me considerably more than other people having a headache. However Theophylline didn't help so that seems to rule out CFS leak. I read CFS leaks cause \"postural headaches\" and you can can get postural headaches for other reasons than CFS leak. Perhaps I should be tested for those less common reasons.\r  \n\r  \nTension headache - But I think its tension headache even though the sides almost never hurt and I only have pain behind my forehead every once in a while. Adderall kills the migraines, makes the tension headaches worse, I take some tizanidine and the headaches go back to how they were before. Also, back before I had any issues resolved Propranolol helped me the most. And propranolol helps migraines and tension headaches. So if it was curing two different kinds of headaches that would definitely explain why it was the best (but it made me so tired I laid down more so that might be misleading me). I can't take Propranolol now. It completely nullifies the Adderall. I need a different muscle relaxer to test this further. Tizanidine ruins noradrenaline and makes me incredibly sleepy. I read there are muscle relaxers that don't change noradrenaline at all, don't significantly raise serotonin (if it raises serotonin more than Adderall's tiny bit I'd guess I can't tolerate it), and are less tiring than Tizanidine I just don't know if they are good for tension headaches.\r  \n\r  \nCould you suggest any tests or medications for me to request from my many doctors?

We have chosen not to become legally married but consider ourselves in a domestic partnership (I mention this to note that while i consider him my husband and am dedicated to him as such, I don\u2019t have the legal rights a legal spouse might have).\n\nBackground details about him: He is white (non-Hispanic) and we live in the USA. He is a 37-year-old cisgender man. He has had long-standing mental health problems (mostly extreme anxiety) since getting sepsis at age 14 which he barely survived. He used to be a heavy drinker before we got together but rarely drinks now. He also used to smoke cigarettes (about 8 a day) and marijuana, but for the past month has cut back on both considerably. He drinks about one energy drink w caffeine daily. He doesn\u2019t do any other recreational drugs. He is prescribed vyvanse, gabapentin, and viibryd for daily use and he *says* he\u2019s been taking them, but I strongly suspect based on the pills he has on hand and his behavior that he hasn\u2019t been for probably 1.5-2 months. He also was prescribed Xanax for occasional panic attacks (so not for daily use) but I don\u2019t think he has taken any in probably 2+ months. He hasn\u2019t seen his psychiatrist in months either. The past year or so was an extremely stressful year for him at work, with the worst occurring about mid-spring of this year, and it was definitely rough for him considering his mental health problems. \n\nCurrent problem: for the past two months he has been declining in every way. He hasn\u2019t showered in at least a month and will only occasionally use bathing wipes I bought for him. He stopped going to work and won\u2019t get a job. He lost his phone for several weeks and had no interest in finding it, so he had to get a new one. He doesn\u2019t spend any time with me and was incredibly rude to his family when they visited last week. He sleeps a lot and spends much of his waking hours in a daze. But most concerningly, he\u2019s become increasingly difficult to converse with. Half of what he says doesn\u2019t make any sense or is filled with non-sequiters. When we went out to eat with his family, he couldn\u2019t even order for himself because he was in a daze. He makes strange jokes and doesn\u2019t remotely understand why me and his parents are concerned. Nor does he understand why he lost his job or why finding a job would be important. We have begged him to see a doctor and he won\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d need to. My husband used to be an extremely hard-worker, always kept up to date on cleaning the house, showered daily, and was very intelligent. We loved watching movies together and playing board games. Now he\u2019s a completely different person and I miss him so much.\n\nHis parents live in another state and the only reason they came here this past week was because I told them I was becoming very concerned. When they visited they agreed that something is wrong, and as the visit progressed they started to suspect, as I do, that despite my partner\u2019s mental health history, this may be something more than a psychiatric problem. It is genuinely hard to describe unless you interact with him, but to us his behavior may indicate something is neurologically, or possibly hormonally, wrong beyond mental illness.\n\nI have reached a point where I have no idea what to do. I have been googling advice and everything tells me either 1) do nothing bc he can make his own decisions, even though I don\u2019t think he\u2019s mentally well enough to do so, or 2) have him admitted to a psych hospital. I am open to the 2nd option if needed, however he is not suicidal or threatening harm to himself or others so idk if it would be an option and regardless, I really think he should be given a full medical evaluation before defaulting to psychiatric hospitalization. But I also don\u2019t know if I would be able to have him admitted to a regular hospital since this may not be an \u201cemergency.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m panicking at this point y\u2019all. It\u2019s hard to work, hard to sleep, hard to eat. And financially we\u2019re hurting. I am so afraid I\u2019m not only losing my husband as a partner, but that he could possibly be really sick. His parents are also confused about what steps to take going forward. Please, I really need advice on what, if anything, I can do to help him.

I had a breast MRI this week and have been flagged for another in 6 months due to fibrocystic areas. \n\nI have had sporadic ocular migraines since I was a teen. My sister also gets them. \n\nI sometimes get tingling in my right hand but I think that's due to poor typing form and phone overuse. \n\nI sometimes experience tightness in my chest and elevated heart rate due to anxiety. \n\n**Meds:**\n\nI take concerta and buproprion daily along with a multivitamin and, now, extra vitamin D and b12. I also take magnesium at night to help me sleep. \n\n**Question:**\n\nMy doctor suggested I see a hematologist at the cancer center. Should I be overly concerned? I can't get an appointment there for 5 weeks. Should I push for something sooner? Are there any specific questions you think I should ask to make sure they are getting to the root cause of this?\n\nI'm about to take a 19 hour flight to Asia in a week, should I worry about this?\n\nThank you! \n\n&#x200B;",

However, I do not think the medication has anything to do with my loss of vision, but maybe the vomiting.\n\nThe other day, I was vomiting every 30 minutes for a couple hours (from 5PM-9PM), everything I ate, my body rejected it. I vomited a total of 7 times that day, this is very unusual for me because I have a pretty strong stomach and I haven't vomited in about 8 years.

I had a LOT of Hydralyte and took panadol about 4 times.\n\nI took a nap for about 45 minutes from really bad fatigue and a headache, and when I stood up at around 7PM, my vision began to blur really badly (I already have pretty bad vision). It started with random black spots appearing, then the spots incrementally grew. I couldn't see at all, except for the few outlines of light (like the light bulbs, faint outlines of certain object depending on where they were in the room). This lasted for about 30 minutes.\n\nI'm not sure if this is related, but every time I stand up (like almost EVERY TIME), I get incredibly dizzy and have even blurrier (than my regular) vision. I get frequent, intense headaches about once a week. I also don't eat that much on a daily basis because I don't feel hungry and I forget/am too lazy to eat.\n\nI've lost my vision due to not eating enough (albeit unintentionally) about twice at this point, can someone tell me what this is and if I should be concerned?

I bleed heavy, and cramp before, during, and after my period. I\u2019d honestly say half of my life is spent in pain due to my cycle. I have an appointment set up with a new gyno in the middle of august but I wanted to post and see if I could get any input before then. I\u2019ve been waiting for this appointment for four months, and I\u2019m super nervous. Before this, I mostly ignored my reproductive health out of fear. \n\nMy biggest concern is I have 2 masses of tissue (?) in my back that I have had for years. I can\u2019t honestly remember when I noticed them. They are right at hip level on my lower back, kind of where some people may have lower back dimples. They are in the same position on both sides. One side is significantly larger than the other. They change in size, and I\u2019ve noticed they seem larger around my period. The largest is the size of a golf ball in my back, but sometimes they\u2019re more penny-sized. They are moveable and you can manipulate them a bit but they never fully go away. Could these be some sort of gland becoming inflamed? The reason I think it\u2019s related to my period is because the majority of the pain on my period centers around those two areas and spreads. The pain in recent times has kept me from getting out of bed. I do TENS, heating pads, baths; no OTC painkiller gives any relief. I have tried everything. \n\nOther helpful info possibly: a fairly irregular cycle, sometimes 2 weeks in between periods, sometimes 3 or 4. I also have a history of ovarian cysts.

I am male, 35 years old, white, average height and build, no significant past medical history. \n\nYesterday I engaged in consensual BDSM sex for the first time. Something unexpected happened, in that my partner bit down on my penis mid-shaft and roughly squeezed my left testicle. This was startling and painful, but we were both more shocked by the small drop of blood that immediately appeared from my urethral meatus. We stopped, and I took the opportunity to go and empty my bladder. I kept my pants on the rest of the night, we made no further attempts to engage in oral sex nor any penetrative sex. \n\nI've seen no more blood since that initial single drop, not last night nor at all today, and it has not been painful to urinate today (last night it was just a bit sensitive the first time). On my penis, there's no swelling, redness, bruising or any other visible mark, no pain on urination, maybe the faintest general discomfort sort of localised towards the tip. My left testicle feels a bit tender and could be a little larger, or it might just be in my head, if it is swollen it is certainly subtle (my partner didn't know this but my left testicle has been aching on and off for over a year, for which my GP prescribed \"watch and wait\"). I haven't tried to get erect since last night so I don't know if that would cause any pain. \n\nThis has all been somewhat mortifying. Obviously the safe answer is \"go see a doctor\". I'd rather not, especially not if it will just be a wasted trip where they say \"you look fine, no obvious signs/symptoms, come back if it gets worse\". Not that it should matter, but I know it does - I'm in the UK, on the NHS. Is it fine to just skip the humiliation of a first trip and only go if anything changes? Or is there something I don't know about this kind of small injury that could come back to \"bite\" me later?",

(I\u2019m very careful with Q-Tips, I only clean the first cm of my ear canal to remove any wax which might damage my hearing aids.) The Q-Tip came out of my right ear covered in a brownish mixture of ear wax and blood. After several cleanings I was only seeing small amounts of fresh red blood. The area felt sore and swollen. Later checks showed small amounts of blood and wax and the soreness remained. The next day was only very small spots of fresh blood but the soreness and swelling were still there, maybe more so. For the last two days there has been no blood but it is still sore and the swelling may have increased slightly. I\u2019m not wearing my right hearing aid because of the soreness.  \nI\u2019ve never had this happen before and I\u2019m wondering what could cause it and if I should seek medical attention.

(1.5M)\nHello,\n\nMy son: 1 and a half year old male, 25lbs, 35 inches, white, no health issues other than constipation. \n\nI've posted before about my son's (1.5 year old) chronic constipation. My question is, how exactly does constipation happen in the bowels? If my son takes high enough doses of stool softeners and laxatives, he'll have one or two mushy poops per day. If he misses a dose or gets a smaller dose, the next day he will still poop, but it will be hard and small. The next day pebbles, and the day after that, he stops pooping altogether. When he gets back on the laxatives, he will go back and forth between pooping water and pooping pebbles until his stool gets back to normal consistency & frequency. \n\nHow could he go from soft wet poops to hard poops within a day? Wouldn't it need to be in his colon longer to get that hard? Does it mean that too much water is being pulled from his intestines? He doesn't seem dehydrated - he wets diapers well, has a wet mouth, cries tears, and drinks water all day long as well as milk bottles. He also eats lots of fiber. \n\nThank you! ",

More symptoms followed including,  blood (not much though) mucous, stabbing/aching pain in stomache. I did a abdominal x-ray, they said I had a big piece of stool stuck and I took laxative to help with it. I did a abdominal ultrasound, they said I was fine and perfectly healthy. My stools are also what I would describe as \"fluffy\" they looked broken, come out in small pieces, ragged and mushy and there's often undigested food pieces on it, sometimes very light in color. I get super nauseous randomly and will throw up, but I always end up dry heaving and throwing up a yellow bile acid, it feels like my body is trying to get rid of something.

Appreciated.\n\nI called my local Emergency and they said it was nothing alarming, but I'm honestly scared right now something wrong is evolving and they're blatantly ignoring it.\n\n**Rant:**\n\nIt's terrible to be told at the phone that I'm young & in great health when I'm telling them I have pale stools, chronic digestive issues, numbness, tingling and weakness in the feet and arms.\n\nI feel like I'm in the wrong country to begin with to get help? Or I don't speak correctly my native language, or am I too naive to try to stay rational at the phone and not being an hysterical mess... ?\n\n**Intro:**\n\nBeen a few days that I'm feeling a growing numbness and paralysis in feet, along with a heat wave, particularly when I eat, but then it goes away within an hour or two.\n\nIt appeared yesterday while eating my oatmeal as bedsnack, and it never went away until I went asleep, whereas **usually** it goes away within minutes.\n\nI've been having this issue at least for 2 weeks, it was happening every few days at the beginning and would last a few minutes at best. Looks like it's evolving to be every day now, almost like every meal...\n\n**What happened:**\n\nI just woke up a few hours earlier and went into eating my oatmeal like usual and :\n\n\\- Numbness, tingling in feet started to appear. No panic yet, I become used to it.\n\nI keep eating and :\n\n\\- I felt a very heavy weight on my mind and whole body, like something or me is going to collapse under something extremely heavy.\n\n\\- I also felt like my heart is going to stop. My body went super silent, I had a short breath and it felt hard to keep it up. It was incredibly scary, the scariest thing I've actually ever experienced for the past few years.\n\nAt this point I start to panic a bit, I called my local emergency for an opinion.\n\nI explain what's happening => Nothing alarming... \"I could send you a doc for checking your reflexes...\"\n\nI'm confused and I say I probably need a bloodwork right now and he answers with \"if the doc says so but your presence right now isn't justified at the emergency room...\". I deny sending me a doc, because I thought by the time he comes in, I'll be either dead or fine, pointless in both cases.\n\nAfter the call, things get worst, numbness goes into my face, then in my whole upper body...\n\nI could still talk (to myself) and laugh with effort, so I tell myself good, probably I won't die...\n\nThe numbness & tingling on my face felt like some kind of paralysis was taking over my body. I was 100% conscious the entire time, aside from the collapsing feeling I was 'trying' to go against.\n\nI felt like flu-like symptoms, weird muscles pains at every joint of my body and I was moving a lot like if I was trying to find a position to alleviate the pain.\n\nWhile going through that last point, I drank plenty of water.\n\nIt's been a while I had a suspicion of electrolytes imbalance, so I thought if it was hyperkalemia, water would wash the excess away,\n\nNow the numbness is almost gone, I have like 10% left in the feet, but it's still quite heavy on my whole body, not to mention the fatigue which is more extreme than usual (which is already quite bad).\n\n**IMPORTANT:**\n\nI took Bactrim 2 weeks ago for an UTI and I lost consciousness for a few seconds, I was paralyzed in my entire body. **I stopped taking it right after that.**\n\nThis was not an allergic reactions. Because the paralysis symptoms I've experienced just a few moment ago are almost identical to when I lost consciousness. Could this really be K related... ? The warnings of the med says Hyperkalemia risks, but considering my chronic digestive issues (SIBO) in that nutrients and calories are badly absorbed (bulky stools), I would be most likely low than high...\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI still feel like I'm going to collapse and very wary about what to do next.\n\nWhat's your opinion on this?\n\nI'm thinking about going for some simple salty rice meal, avoid potassium and calcium entirely for the time being, and drink plenty of water... maybe sodium bicarbonate?\n\nThank you.",

Wednesday, I made sure I was definitely hydrated and drank around 2L+ just in the afternoon, but still had that extremely strong urine smell and noticed it looked much darker than it should having just drank that much water over a few hours. \n\nThursday afternoon, still having the strong urine, I started to feel like my bladder was still full after peeing. This is when I caught on that something definitely was not right and suspected a possible UTI but had no pain at all. I had possibly used the bathroom a little more than usual that day, though nothing drastically noticeable, but as the afternoon progressed I was peeing small amounts quite frequently with a lot of discomfort around my bladder area. \n\nI went and saw my GP who used one of those dip sticks and said my urine looked fine and that the stick only showed a very small amount of white blood cells. She sent it off for a urine culture test and gave me a script for antibiotics but told me not to take them until they get the results back on Saturday and will call me if it's positive for a UTI, unless it gets worse. \n\nThat brings me today,  Friday. My urine smelled strong this morning but is ok now. Around noon, I started to experience pain on both my sides and my back. I've not got my results back but bought and started the antibiotics (Cefalexin 500mg, twice a day). \n\nI haven't been feeling the bladder fullness since this morning or needing to pee since around noon. Throughout this whole experience, I've experienced no pain while urinating at all and have had no blood in my urine and I don't have a fever. \n\nAt the moment I'm mostly experiencing a sharp pain on my left side, with occasional pain on the right side. There is pain when I press on my left side. It gets worse when I walk and move around. \n\nWhile the pain started by being there pretty consistently on both sides while at work (mostly driving and standing), its now an on and off stabbing pain that lasts a few seconds while sitting or laying down, or consistently there when walking. \n\nThe pain isn't unbearable, if I get a bad stab it's maybe gotten to a 6 or so and makes me jump. It's mostly just really uncomfortable and annoying. \n\nOriginally I thought my UTI may have turned into a kidney infection but now I'm wondering if I have stones. I also started Aspen Dexamphetamine about 9 days ago, prescribed my by Psychiatrist for ADHD. No other medication or medical conditions other than PCOS.\n\nMy plan is to continue the antibiotics and go back to my doctor if it doesn't go away or to ER if the pain gets severe. \n\nAny thoughts? I'd love to have a better idea on what I may be dealing with. Thanks!!",

I was undergoing testing for sleep disorders roughly 1 year ago, but stopped the testing/cancelled appointments due to developing a terrible fear of hospitals (MS diagnosis related- I know it was silly of me). At the point I ended testing, sleep apnea had been ruled out. But nothing else had been tested yet. The Dr said Narcolepsy was possible, though I doubt this, as I don't think I would 'pass' an MSLT.\n\nI am aware that many of these symptoms are normal, but I thought I would add everything in case it's relevant. \n\n\nAs a teen and an adult:\n\n-I sometimes don't sleep for 48ish hours, for seemingly no reason.\n\n-I sometimes sleep for 18+ hours. If I didn't have responsibilities I could sleep longer as I don't seem to have the 'wake up' urge that everyone else has. \n\n-I struggle to tell the difference between dreams and real life. I very often think that my dreams actually happened, and recently missed a dental appointment as I dreamed that I'd changed the date.

She did have diabetes after the surgery but that has also resolved. Now, 3.5 years later, my mom is facing the prospect of a kidney transplant. Apparently the anti rejection drugs are very toxic and as such, her kidney function is severely compromised. She had 1 hospitalization in march 2022 for kidney failure (it was terrifying)which kept her in the hospital an entire month. \n\nIn the last 3 months she has lost 30 pounds and weighs 97lbs now, about 5\u20195. The stress levels for our family have been huge, so that is definitely playing a huge role. \n\n6 weeks ago she was told dialysis is imminent with kidney functioning levels at 18. \n\nShe met with her care team on Wednesday this week and they said her kidney function is up to 30 now and they aren\u2019t looking at dialysis on the same timeline. They were quite shocked at the recovery. \n\nShe\u2019s supposed to meet with a vascular surgeon anyways so they can assess her for a port, as they feel it is inevitable she will eventually need dialysis. \n\nMy mom is in discomfort all the time. Her headaches, the horrible leg cramps every night, bowel issues, all of it is so much to endure for 1 person, her medication is life sustaining but it\u2019s also slowly killing her. Her kidney issues make it difficult for her to eat because her diet is so restricted. I\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t want the kidney Transplant because life is already so difficult with transplanted lungs. I\u2019m hoping to be the one to donate a kidney if she will proceed. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1.  Is it unusual for her kidney function to go up and down so much? \n\n2. if the situation Becomes acute, can she get dialysis right away or will they try to do a transplant immediately? \n\n3. Will the kidney transplant be physically easier to recover from than the lung transplant? \n\nSorry if this post is scattered, things are very difficult right now. \n\nMy mom is the centre of my world\u2026thank you very much for taking the time to read this.

I treated my chronic back pain mostly with chiropractor and acupuncture, guided hypnosis sleep meditation...  Anything and everything I could do to keep off meds while pregnant.  \n\nI had Gestational Hypertension which just started to turn to Preeclampsia same day they induced me at 37 weeks (had run preeclampsia test 24 hours before and was fine). After 24hrs induced and on magnesium I kept telling the nurses and Drs that magnesium was making me very sick, they kept saying it was normal and blaming preeclampsia, and it wasn't until I could barely speak and kept checking myself for stroke signs that they finally listened to me and cut the dose in half, I think it was 2mg to 1 mg but I don't know for sure, but it water being on it for 24 hours before dose was cut in half. Started feeling better but still almost paralyzed heavy and blind from magnesium.  Another 24 hrs.later they were getting ready to do a C-section cause baby was getting D cells and stopped progressing at 8cm.  They ran my blood and I was 3X the level of Magnesium toxicity (I think it was 2.5 was high and I was almost at an 8, but don't quote me, I just remember the travel nurse saying \"wow you're 3X the level of toxicity\" or something like that and she gave me numbers), even after they cut my levels in half and 24 hours later.  I ended up being manually dilated, baby was twisted wrong way so they manually twisted her and I delivered vaginally.  Immediately after birth I had a flash pulmonary adema, then had a latent post partem hemorrhage at about 13hrs PP once they got my breathing stabilized.\n\nWhat would cause me to have such bad magnesium toxicity and would magnesium toxicity cause a flash pulmonary adema?  I believe the Pitosin caused my hemorrhage, but just odd so long PP.  I had hemorrhage before but only on deliveries that were induced.\n\nI want another baby so bad.  But having that much go wrong with that delivery terrifies me.  Is there something I can do ahead of time?  What would cause me to get magnesium toxicity?  Is there other options, other things I should do that my body wasn't processing the magnesium, or was this most likely a malpractice and someone was screwing up the doses?

I moved recently, I am on a waiting list for Neurology in my new area, but have no formal Neurologist yet. My insurance changed so I can\u2019t see the old Neurologist. \n\nI feel helpless.

I haven\u2019t changed my diet, or physical routine(until recently where I\u2019ve been in bed because of the head pain/light sensitivity).

[26M]\n**Me**\n\n26 M white male, no other health issues, nonsmoker, nondrinker\n\n**Symptoms**  \n1. Constant tension headaches for 8 months which feel like pressure around my ears, my forehead, and my temple region. Little if any pain, but lots of tightness that is severely uncomfortable.\n\n2. Ear fullness that I can \"pop\" away but consistently returns  \n**What I've tried**\n\nIt's unclear what the cause is, which is infuriating. Here are the things that I've tried.\n\n1.

CT Scan of TMJ joints \u2014 Normal\n4. Sleep Test: AHI of 5.6, RDI of 20.0 (mild-moderate sleep apnea)\n   1. I'm quite skinny and I sleep on my stomach, so maybe more likely UARS?\n\n**What makes it worse**\n\n1. When I bite together, I feel a muscle around my ears being triggered and they instantly get more \"full\". I'm not sure whether this is related to my tension headaches, but the ear fullness I feel when doing this is the same as the symptom I outline.\n\n**Important Notes**\n\n1. I have very little stress. I really manage stress well. Beyond stress *caused by* this, it's not stress. I am retired. I have a great life. I meditate and exercise. No mental health issues. \n\n**My theories**\n\n1. TMJ\n   1. I don't *currently* clench my teeth while sleeping or awake. However, this did begin 3 months after a stressful period where I was clenching a lot. I wonder if this messed up a disc.\n      1. My bite jerks to one side at a certain point during mouth opening, which it didn't used to. **However, a TMJ specialist (regarded as one of the best in NYC and referred to me by my orthodontist, who thought my disc could be messed up) believed that this could not be caused by my disc.** \n      2. I do not have pain or visible TMJ issues on CT scan, so according to specialist, this is unlikely.\n2. UARS/OSA \n   1. I'm getting a CPAP machine to try because I'm desperate. But I don't think that it will help me very much. I don't really suffer from any fatigue. But who knows.\n   2. This was put forth as the main theory by the TMJ specialist after seeing my sleep study\n\n**My questions**\n\n1. Could I have a disc issue based on the above? I don't have pain in either TMJ at all, and the CT was normal, but I'm not sure this jerking motion is as \"normal\" as it was made out to be by the specialist. **Should I push for an MRI of that disc?**\n2. If this is related to UARS/OSA, **does that explain the chronic ear fullness?** This is a very distinct symptom that started exactly at the same time\n3. What else am I not thinking of? Is it really true that these headaches can just randomly appear and my best hope is trying random stuff?",

I am male, 35 years old, white, average height and build, no significant past medical history. \n\nYesterday I engaged in consensual BDSM sex for the first time. Something unexpected happened, in that my partner bit down on my penis mid-shaft and roughly squeezed my left testicle. This was startling and painful, but we were both more shocked by the small drop of blood that immediately appeared from my urethral meatus. We stopped, and I took the opportunity to go and empty my bladder. I kept my pants on the rest of the night, we made no further attempts to engage in oral sex nor any penetrative sex. \n\nI've seen no more blood since that initial single drop, not last night nor at all today, and it has not been painful to urinate today (last night it was just a bit sensitive the first time). On my penis, there's no swelling, redness, bruising or any other visible mark, no pain on urination, maybe the faintest general discomfort sort of localised towards the tip. My left testicle feels a bit tender and could be a little larger, or it might just be in my head, if it is swollen it is certainly subtle (my partner didn't know this but my left testicle has been aching on and off for over a year, for which my GP prescribed \"watch and wait\"). I haven't tried to get erect since last night so I don't know if that would cause any pain. \n\nThis has all been somewhat mortifying. Obviously the safe answer is \"go see a doctor\". I'd rather not, especially not if it will just be a wasted trip where they say \"you look fine, no obvious signs/symptoms, come back if it gets worse\". Not that it should matter, but I know it does - I'm in the UK, on the NHS. Is it fine to just skip the humiliation of a first trip and only go if anything changes? Or is there something I don't know about this kind of small injury that could come back to \"bite\" me later?",

It's not something I could live with until recently and made plans to kill myself many times in the past 2 years because of it. I never followed through with the plans though. I've heard about depression induced pseudodementia and it sounds like a possible cause for my failing mental state. The shame and stress caused from confronting that part of my identity also made me physically sick for months and made my skin hypersensitive to touch and temperature as well.

Turns out that all of my issues I had during pregnancy, the cause of my son\u2019s stillbirth, and my chest pain and dizziness were all a result of Rheumatic Heart Disease.\n\nI ended up having a stroke and I thought that would change my urgency of care, but still I was dismissed by all of my providers. My cardiologist was very condescending and said my issues, specifically worsening issues, such as extreme chest pain, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, feeling a cold fluid feeling in my chest, my swollen abdomen and feet, and a hard cough, were just the result of stress and anxiety. I asked for an updated echocardiogram since I had one last year and much has change with my symptoms. I was denied and said an echo was absolutely not needed in my case. \n\nI went to my primary care who was also condescending and said it was anxiety. At the point of anger and tears I told her I felt like I\u2019m dying and I needed help. She said she was not a cardiologist but if it would help me feel better she would order an echocardiogram at the local hospital. \n\nMonday I had the echo. Wednesday I was diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease affecting both the mitral and tricuspid valves. There is still no urgency from my care team. I\u2019m being ignored by my PCP. My cardiologist gave a half-hearted \u201cwe\u2019ll request the echo records\u201d when I called them. I feel even worse. My chest pain now only ends when I feel a burst of fluid that feels like it fills my chest and neck. I\u2019m having trouble breathing all the time. But if I have a feeling if I traveled to the ER again, I\u2019d be dismissed right away just like I was before in pregnancy and earlier postpartum. I\u2019ve had this chest pain for months and especially when I was pregnant but for all the 6 times I went to Labor and Delivery I was discharged right away and never given an EKG or any cardiac work up. Same with my OB. \n\nSeparately, I\u2019m seeing a neurologist for my TIA. He\u2019s found something doing an EEG and multiple MRIs. He won\u2019t tell me the results until my follow up on 2 weeks but told me I absolutely cannot work or drive. \n\nI\u2019m truly at a loss of what to do. If I call the office I get attitude from both the nurses and receptionists. I can\u2019t even find good information on this disease because it seems like it\u2019s not common in developed countries. I live in the US, I\u2019m upper-middle class, I have always taken my full course of antibiotics when I\u2019ve had strep. I just don\u2019t understand how of the thousands and thousands of dollars I\u2019ve spent trying to get help over the past few months all I have to show for it is a permanent heart condition, a dead child, and no plan moving forward.",

I think it would be classified as normotrophic? The scar's not raised or textured, but noticably darker and looks similar to when I get minor wounds and after they've completely closed up, but are still visible as temporary scars (lasting maybe a few months). \n\nI have had this scar for my whole life, have never had a surgery relating to anywhere on my torso or reproductive parts, and never sustained severe injuries in this region. My bellybutton has no irregular scarring or shaping, so I don't think it's a result of umbilical cord removal.\n\nHere's where the interesting stuff comes up. I was abandoned as an infant in China during the one-child policy. I have all the reproductive parts and functions of a female (breasts, periods, reproductive parts), and I am apathetic to my own gender expression. Because of this gender apathy, one time when I mentioned the mystery scar to my friend, they sarcastically said \"maybe you were a hermaphrodite and your chinese parents cut your penis off so that you'd get adopted.\" that sounds ridiculous, and I know that intersex people don't simply have both sets of genitalia (at least not fully functioning), but honestly in my mind it's not an impossibility, and I can't help but wonder if I am actually intersex, but my bio family or whoever was there for my birth, to remove any irregular genitals so that I would have a better chance at getting adopted. \n\nThere is a rumour that floats around the Chinese-Adoption sphere that sometimes abandoned children would have a strange and unique scar so that if need be in the future, the bio parents could identify their child. I've heard a lot of mixed things about the reality of this, but it is true that when I was adopted, I had a scar on my leg that looked like a messy burn scar from a metal brand. It stayed visible on me for the first 12 years of my life before eventually fading. In China, the orphanages usually house children with disabilities or birth defects more than any other demographic because \"normal\" babies are sent out for adoption (like what happened to me).\n\nMy current family doctor's earliest records of me are from when I started the immigration process, so the first year of my life has no medical record of what could have been done. It is also possible that my actual date of birth is incorrect since the orphanage assigned a predicted date when finding me abandoned. \n\nIn blood tests, I have the following irregularities:\n\n* elevated RBC\n* below average MCV\n* elevated triglycerides\n* extremely low ferritin\n\nMy doctor has diagnosed me with thalassemia, and other than that, I have no other official diagnosis or treatments. Is it actually possible that I was born interssex? If not, what could this scar be from?",

        "context": "Need advice for my partner (37M)\n\nNote: using a throwaway account.\n\nI have been with my partner for about seven years. We have chosen not to become legally married but consider ourselves in a domestic partnership (I mention this to note that while i consider him my husband and am dedicated to him as such, I don\u2019t have the legal rights a legal spouse might have).\n\nBackground details about him: He is white (non-Hispanic) and we live in the USA. He is a 37-year-old cisgender man. He has had long-standing mental health problems (mostly extreme anxiety) since getting sepsis at age 14 which he barely survived. He used to be a heavy drinker before we got together but rarely drinks now. He also used to smoke cigarettes (about 8 a day) and marijuana, but for the past month has cut back on both considerably. He drinks about one energy drink w caffeine daily. He doesn\u2019t do any other recreational drugs. He is prescribed vyvanse, gabapentin, and viibryd for daily use and he *says* he\u2019s been taking them, but I strongly suspect based on the pills he has on hand and his behavior that he hasn\u2019t been for probably 1.5-2 months. He also was prescribed Xanax for occasional panic attacks (so not for daily use) but I don\u2019t think he has taken any in probably 2+ months. He hasn\u2019t seen his psychiatrist in months either. The past year or so was an extremely stressful year for him at work, with the worst occurring about mid-spring of this year, and it was definitely rough for him considering his mental health problems. \n\nCurrent problem: for the past two months he has been declining in every way. He hasn\u2019t showered in at least a month and will only occasionally use bathing wipes I bought for him. He stopped going to work and won\u2019t get a job. He lost his phone for several weeks and had no interest in finding it, so he had to get a new one. He doesn\u2019t spend any time with me and was incredibly rude to his family when they visited last week. He sleeps a lot and spends much of his waking hours in a daze. But most concerningly, he\u2019s become increasingly difficult to converse with. Half of what he says doesn\u2019t make any sense or is filled with non-sequiters. When we went out to eat with his family, he couldn\u2019t even order for himself because he was in a daze. He makes strange jokes and doesn\u2019t remotely understand why me and his parents are concerned. Nor does he understand why he lost his job or why finding a job would be important. We have begged him to see a doctor and he won\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d need to. My husband used to be an extremely hard-worker, always kept up to date on cleaning the house, showered daily, and was very intelligent. We loved watching movies together and playing board games. Now he\u2019s a completely different person and I miss him so much.\n\nHis parents live in another state and the only reason they came here this past week was because I told them I was becoming very concerned. When they visited they agreed that something is wrong, and as the visit progressed they started to suspect, as I do, that despite my partner\u2019s mental health history, this may be something more than a psychiatric problem. It is genuinely hard to describe unless you interact with him, but to us his behavior may indicate something is neurologically, or possibly hormonally, wrong beyond mental illness.\n\nI have reached a point where I have no idea what to do. I have been googling advice and everything tells me either 1) do nothing bc he can make his own decisions, even though I don\u2019t think he\u2019s mentally well enough to do so, or 2) have him admitted to a psych hospital. I am open to the 2nd option if needed, however he is not suicidal or threatening harm to himself or others so idk if it would be an option and regardless, I really think he should be given a full medical evaluation before defaulting to psychiatric hospitalization. But I also don\u2019t know if I would be able to have him admitted to a regular hospital since this may not be an \u201cemergency.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m panicking at this point y\u2019all. It\u2019s hard to work, hard to sleep, hard to eat. And financially we\u2019re hurting. I am so afraid I\u2019m not only losing my husband as a partner, but that he could possibly be really sick. His parents are also confused about what steps to take going forward. Please, I really need advice on what, if anything, I can do to help him. Sorry if this is long or confusing, I\u2019m frazzled at this point.",

(May 2022.) \n\n\\* Stepped on Rusty nail in filthiest shoes possible. Photo link below.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/vjtk4e8\n\nI am a teacher and I also enjoy woodworking. I am building a 'Buddy Bench' for our elementary school playground, and we have also been DIY renovating our home this entire summer. I managed to step on an extremely rusty nail that had been outside for weeks. This happened two days ago (on Wednesday.) I was changing the bit on my trim router without gloves (brilliant, I know) and then I clipped the side of my hand and started to bleed. I leaned over to grab a paper towel, tripped, hit the side of my house, bounced off of the siding, ran into the deck railing, and then somehow flipped over my bin of scrap wood/trim and dumped it all over and then landed straight on top of a piece of shoe molding with nails sticking straight up. I jammed my foot down pretty hard/suddenly and the nail blew straight through the sole of my garden boots and punctured a little more than 1/4 inch into my foot. It was enough to cause pretty sharp pain and I did have very minor bleeding. \n\nI went straight upstairs to my bathroom and my husband, who is on peritoneal dialysis here at home, grabbed a ton of his supplies and I immediately: \n\n1.) Washed my hands, put on gloves, and then washed the puncture wound with Hibiclens for about 2-3 minutes (we used a piece of gauze for this.) I let it sit for another minute and then rinsed it off. \n\n2.) New gloves, and then I opened a pair of surgical tweezers from a package and used these to remove a chunk of the sole of my boot from the wound. \n\n3.) Washed the wound again with Hibiclens. \n\n4.) Soaked gauze in the debriding/antimicrobial liquid called 'Except' that he uses to clean his exit site for his PD catheter. I let this sit on my foot for the suggested two minutes. \n\n5.) I applied his Gentamicin ointment to my foot and then covered with a silver alginate dressing and then closed it up with one of his island bandages. I put a new, clean sock on it and then went to urgent care pronto because I believe my last Tetanus shot was in 2013...I just wasn't sure and didn't want to take any chances at all. \n\nI let the P.A at the Urgent Care have a look and he said it definitely got me, but it sounded like I did a solid job cleaning it up initially. He didn't see any more shoe bits inside and put a clean bandage on it for me and then definitely agreed that I needed a tetanus booster, so we got that done and I left. \n\nHe didn't believe I needed any preventative antibiotics at that time but did tell me that if I noticed any signs of infection, increased pain, drainage, fever, etc...to come back immediately. \n\nVaccines can obviously cause you to feel gross for a day or two, and I started feeling like absolute crap last night. Body aches, fatigue, and a very, very sore foot, calf, thigh, and hip. I figured this is from limping/overcompensating and my muscles just hurt. It hurts to ball my foot up or move it much. \n\nMy question is this: Does this sound normal for this situation and is not giving a prophylactic antibiotic the right choice for me? I think the wound looks pretty good, but I'm not a medical professional so I don't trust my own assessment LOL.  I've been keeping it super clean and covered. I'm just worried about possible infection. I don't want/mean to be paranoid, I just don't want to develop any complications. As mentioned above...my husband already has ongoing health problems. We have two young children AND I'm a new teacher that's about to start back to work in two weeks. I do NOT want or need any problems that could have been prevented.\n\nThe P.A was a great guy and I trust him for the most part, I just wanted to see what someone else has to say about it. In the grand scheme of things, this isn't a very severe nail puncture wound, but what bothers me most is the pair of boots I had on. They are absolutely filthy and I have cleaned loads of cat litter, black mold, toilets, garages, been to the landfill repeatedly, and the list goes on. The thought of a chunk of the sole of those nasty things going into my foot (along with a rusty nail) just gives me the creeps :/ \n\nAs long as the wound looks OK and I am up to date on my Tetanus shot, I should be fine to just watch and wait, right? Please ease my mind. \n\n&#x200B;",

        "context": "Sinus pressure on palate after jaw surgery\nHi all,\n\nI am currently 32, male.  I am obese and take medications for blood pressure and anxiety.  I was born with an underbite and crossbite and so at approx. age 25 I started a two part orthognathic surgical process to correct this.  The first surgery, a SARPE (surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion) was uneventful, but the bone-borne palatal expander that was implanted in the roof of my mouth fractured a week after surgery (while being activated via the wrench provided) and was prematurely removed, while the doctors maintained the transverse width that I had achieved to that point and move forward with orthodontics in preparation for the second surgery.  The second surgery, a Le Fort I osteotomy, advanced the maxilla forward.  I then had several additional months of orthodontics.\n\nAfter the braces were removed it was clear that my crossbite remained, likely as a result of inadequate expansion of the maxilla because of the palatal expander failure.  I was recommended for a revision surgery which I had done in 2019.  The new surgeon removed the hardware (plates and screws) from the Le Fort I osteotomy and repeated the SARPE procedure from scratch.  \n\nAfter this repeat SARPE surgery, the upper right quadrant of teeth either shifted downward entirely or the teeth erupted downward and I suffered root resorption and gum recession on almost all right side maxillary as a result.  I also developed a burning sensation in the right side of the hard palate, and a sensation of fullness/inflation when I breathe through my nose.  If I perform a Valsalva maneuver and breathe into my nose I feel air pressure on almost all teeth on the right side of the maxilla (and not the left), and it feels as if something is \"inflating\" between my right-side hard palate/teeth and the floor of my right nostril.  Additionally, if I shift my mandible left to right it activates a sort of suction/popping that is both clearly audible but also felt in those same areas of the palate/nasal floor.  I do not believe this popping is coming from the jaw joints (TMJ).\n\nA recent CT scan at my periodontist showed fluid in the right maxillary sinus, but other than that my jaw surgeon (who did the revision) has offered no explanation, and neither has any orthodontist or the periodontist himself.  The periodontist has recommended seeing an ENT which I am doing next month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestions: \n\n1. Why did the right side of my maxilla/those teeth shift downward after the revision SARPE procedure?\n2. Why did the gums recede on those teeth at the same time as the downward shift?\n3. What is going on with the air pressure/popping/clicking in the palate/nasal floor?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy jaw surgeon has shrugged off my complaints and it has made me feel powerless over my own health.

My cardiologist was very condescending and said my issues, specifically worsening issues, such as extreme chest pain, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, feeling a cold fluid feeling in my chest, my swollen abdomen and feet, and a hard cough, were just the result of stress and anxiety. I asked for an updated echocardiogram since I had one last year and much has change with my symptoms. I was denied and said an echo was absolutely not needed in my case. \n\nI went to my primary care who was also condescending and said it was anxiety. At the point of anger and tears I told her I felt like I\u2019m dying and I needed help. She said she was not a cardiologist but if it would help me feel better she would order an echocardiogram at the local hospital. \n\nMonday I had the echo. Wednesday I was diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease affecting both the mitral and tricuspid valves. There is still no urgency from my care team. I\u2019m being ignored by my PCP. My cardiologist gave a half-hearted \u201cwe\u2019ll request the echo records\u201d when I called them. I feel even worse.

Now 2023 just got routine blood work back and there it is hypercalcemia again fueling my anxiety.

We have chosen not to become legally married but consider ourselves in a domestic partnership (I mention this to note that while i consider him my husband and am dedicated to him as such, I don\u2019t have the legal rights a legal spouse might have).\n\nBackground details about him: He is white (non-Hispanic) and we live in the USA. He is a 37-year-old cisgender man. He has had long-standing mental health problems (mostly extreme anxiety) since getting sepsis at age 14 which he barely survived. He used to be a heavy drinker before we got together but rarely drinks now. He also used to smoke cigarettes (about 8 a day) and marijuana, but for the past month has cut back on both considerably. He drinks about one energy drink w caffeine daily. He doesn\u2019t do any other recreational drugs. He is prescribed vyvanse, gabapentin, and viibryd for daily use and he *says* he\u2019s been taking them, but I strongly suspect based on the pills he has on hand and his behavior that he hasn\u2019t been for probably 1.5-2 months. He also was prescribed Xanax for occasional panic attacks (so not for daily use) but I don\u2019t think he has taken any in probably 2+ months. He hasn\u2019t seen his psychiatrist in months either. The past year or so was an extremely stressful year for him at work, with the worst occurring about mid-spring of this year, and it was definitely rough for him considering his mental health problems. \n\nCurrent problem: for the past two months he has been declining in every way. He hasn\u2019t showered in at least a month and will only occasionally use bathing wipes I bought for him. He stopped going to work and won\u2019t get a job. He lost his phone for several weeks and had no interest in finding it, so he had to get a new one. He doesn\u2019t spend any time with me and was incredibly rude to his family when they visited last week. He sleeps a lot and spends much of his waking hours in a daze. But most concerningly, he\u2019s become increasingly difficult to converse with. Half of what he says doesn\u2019t make any sense or is filled with non-sequiters. When we went out to eat with his family, he couldn\u2019t even order for himself because he was in a daze. He makes strange jokes and doesn\u2019t remotely understand why me and his parents are concerned. Nor does he understand why he lost his job or why finding a job would be important. We have begged him to see a doctor and he won\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d need to. My husband used to be an extremely hard-worker, always kept up to date on cleaning the house, showered daily, and was very intelligent. We loved watching movies together and playing board games. Now he\u2019s a completely different person and I miss him so much.\n\nHis parents live in another state and the only reason they came here this past week was because I told them I was becoming very concerned. When they visited they agreed that something is wrong, and as the visit progressed they started to suspect, as I do, that despite my partner\u2019s mental health history, this may be something more than a psychiatric problem. It is genuinely hard to describe unless you interact with him, but to us his behavior may indicate something is neurologically, or possibly hormonally, wrong beyond mental illness.\n\nI have reached a point where I have no idea what to do. I have been googling advice and everything tells me either 1) do nothing bc he can make his own decisions, even though I don\u2019t think he\u2019s mentally well enough to do so, or 2) have him admitted to a psych hospital. I am open to the 2nd option if needed, however he is not suicidal or threatening harm to himself or others so idk if it would be an option and regardless, I really think he should be given a full medical evaluation before defaulting to psychiatric hospitalization. But I also don\u2019t know if I would be able to have him admitted to a regular hospital since this may not be an \u201cemergency.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m panicking at this point y\u2019all. It\u2019s hard to work, hard to sleep, hard to eat. And financially we\u2019re hurting. I am so afraid I\u2019m not only losing my husband as a partner, but that he could possibly be really sick. His parents are also confused about what steps to take going forward. Please, I really need advice on what, if anything, I can do to help him. Sorry if this is long or confusing, I\u2019m frazzled at this point.",

After I finished wiping, I immediately started to feel discomfort down there. It started itching a couple of hours later and now its straight up burning! It's been a few days already and it feels worse by the day that I currently have an ice pack in my underwear and that seems to be the only thing calming it down. It is very red and irritated and now it burns when I pee.\n\nI had zero of these symptoms before I used that bathroom and it has been over a month since I had a (safe) sexual encounter. I bought some Monistat cream that comes in tomorrow morning that I plan on using, but I'm wondering if I should make a doctor's appointment instead? There is no other symptoms other than the itching, burning, and burning pee. I also should be starting my period in the next 2 days, but I don't think that's related.",

        "context": "Need advice for my partner (37M)\n\nNote: using a throwaway account.\n\nI have been with my partner for about seven years. We have chosen not to become legally married but consider ourselves in a domestic partnership (I mention this to note that while i consider him my husband and am dedicated to him as such, I don\u2019t have the legal rights a legal spouse might have).\n\nBackground details about him: He is white (non-Hispanic) and we live in the USA. He is a 37-year-old cisgender man. He has had long-standing mental health problems (mostly extreme anxiety) since getting sepsis at age 14 which he barely survived. He used to be a heavy drinker before we got together but rarely drinks now. He also used to smoke cigarettes (about 8 a day) and marijuana, but for the past month has cut back on both considerably. He drinks about one energy drink w caffeine daily. He doesn\u2019t do any other recreational drugs. He is prescribed vyvanse, gabapentin, and viibryd for daily use and he *says* he\u2019s been taking them, but I strongly suspect based on the pills he has on hand and his behavior that he hasn\u2019t been for probably 1.5-2 months. He also was prescribed Xanax for occasional panic attacks (so not for daily use) but I don\u2019t think he has taken any in probably 2+ months. He hasn\u2019t seen his psychiatrist in months either. The past year or so was an extremely stressful year for him at work, with the worst occurring about mid-spring of this year, and it was definitely rough for him considering his mental health problems. \n\nCurrent problem: for the past two months he has been declining in every way. He hasn\u2019t showered in at least a month and will only occasionally use bathing wipes I bought for him. He stopped going to work and won\u2019t get a job. He lost his phone for several weeks and had no interest in finding it, so he had to get a new one. He doesn\u2019t spend any time with me and was incredibly rude to his family when they visited last week. He sleeps a lot and spends much of his waking hours in a daze. But most concerningly, he\u2019s become increasingly difficult to converse with. Half of what he says doesn\u2019t make any sense or is filled with non-sequiters. When we went out to eat with his family, he couldn\u2019t even order for himself because he was in a daze. He makes strange jokes and doesn\u2019t remotely understand why me and his parents are concerned. Nor does he understand why he lost his job or why finding a job would be important. We have begged him to see a doctor and he won\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d need to. My husband used to be an extremely hard-worker, always kept up to date on cleaning the house, showered daily, and was very intelligent. We loved watching movies together and playing board games. Now he\u2019s a completely different person and I miss him so much.\n\nHis parents live in another state and the only reason they came here this past week was because I told them I was becoming very concerned. When they visited they agreed that something is wrong, and as the visit progressed they started to suspect, as I do, that despite my partner\u2019s mental health history, this may be something more than a psychiatric problem. It is genuinely hard to describe unless you interact with him, but to us his behavior may indicate something is neurologically, or possibly hormonally, wrong beyond mental illness.\n\nI have reached a point where I have no idea what to do. I have been googling advice and everything tells me either 1) do nothing bc he can make his own decisions, even though I don\u2019t think he\u2019s mentally well enough to do so, or 2) have him admitted to a psych hospital. I am open to the 2nd option if needed, however he is not suicidal or threatening harm to himself or others so idk if it would be an option and regardless, I really think he should be given a full medical evaluation before defaulting to psychiatric hospitalization. But I also don\u2019t know if I would be able to have him admitted to a regular hospital since this may not be an \u201cemergency.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m panicking at this point y\u2019all. It\u2019s hard to work, hard to sleep, hard to eat. And financially we\u2019re hurting. I am so afraid I\u2019m not only losing my husband as a partner, but that he could possibly be really sick. His parents are also confused about what steps to take going forward. Please, I really need advice on what, if anything, I can do to help him. Sorry if this is long or confusing, I\u2019m frazzled at this point.",

How can I fix this so I get better qulaity sleep? I read online flonase could help, which I luckily have in a cabinet and will begin trying to use. Are there any other suggestions? Is it the sleep thats causing me to feel like this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nI believe my nasal cavities closing/swelling up when laying down is causing me to struggle to breathe when asleep, causing extreme fatigue throughout the day. Not sure what a good solution would be, or why this is happening. ",

My proximal phalanx of my right middle finger hurts most and almost always lately. Sudden obvious hole in chest.\n\n\nHave been willingly losing weight intermittently since june 2022, around -12 kg max. went from 1.76 and 70kg to about 58. Very low muscle mass. Stopped having sex  since August 2022 (breakup with long term partner) and my periods have become irregular around that time, following it it seems. Also had period abnormalities following all 3 covid shots, last one being in April 2022. Seemingly acquired asexuality and disinterest in love in the past couple of months, I have always lacked in this aspect but I can tell I have completely drifted away from that whole concept of sexuality.\n\nMy life has been getting way better since I stopped having periods, at first I had some terrible anxiety episodes like I never experienced, and overall bad mental health out of nowhere, terrible ups and downs. But after a few weeks I was more stable than ever and thrived and I still do. I am in a way avoiding getting checked because I love riding this wave so much. Problem is I have begun getting these bone symptoms which I figured might be due to my possible lack of estrogen. \n\nBigger problem at the moment: I have always had weird bones, had an inflamed sternum at some point a few months ago but I evaluated it and it all seemed fine. Yesterday I looked in the mirror and noticed I have a weird shape to my ribcage, realized I have a whole hole in my chest, exact definition of pectus excavatum. But I am fairly certain I didn't have it before, despite my ribcage flare and scoliosis+hyper lordosis+cyphosis. The hole hurts when I press on it.\n\nI was wondering if it's possible to have become accentuated just now and I just had a very mild version beforehand, or if I could have literally acquired it due to my hormonal imbalances. If you have longer explanations I'm all for it. Also curious about my amenorrhea. Will finally be seeing an endocrinologist sometime these weeks, but my concerns are massive just now.",

There is a cluster of lymph nodes on the right side of my neck (tonsil area) that are swollen. I have seen general doctors and specialists about it but have no answer yet.\n\nThey're painful to the touch and become sore if I manipulate them too much. Some days, I cannot feel them and they don't bother me. Other days, they're sore and the discomfort radiates to my ear and makes it uncomfortable to move my head a certain way and to swallow.\n\nDuring exams, doctor said that my throat and tonsils look fine and not inflamed.\n\nOn blood tests, there is no apparent issue:\n- Blood cells are fine\n- Thyroid is fine\n- CRP is high but has always been high since I have endometriosis\n- Negative for Epstein-Barr, CMV, toxoplasmosis, Basedow  \n- Negative for STIs\n\nDuring cervical ultrasound, specialist noticed that the lymph nodes were enlarged (+ a 4mm cyst on my thyroid that didn't worry me because I've had 10+cm cysts on my ovaries) but said it looked noncancerous so I shouldn't worry. \n\nI've seen the doctor again and have done multiple blood tests, all showing the same results.\n\nI have no other swollen lymph nodes on any part of my body (that I know of). I have night sweats and chronic fatigue but those are likely related to endometriosis because I've had them since before the nodes appeared.\n\nI am on dienogest and ethinylestradiol (daily) to manage endometriosis stage 4 (+ I take painkillers like paracetamol, NSAIDs, codein depending on pain level, not daily).\n\nI am 22F, located in France, don't smoke, don't drink, eat healthy and exercise regularly. \n\nHas any of you ever seen a case like this? The doctors I see keep telling me that I ''shouldn't worry and there isn't anything going on''. I wouldn't worry if those lymph nodes didn't bother me almost everyday since they are sometimes painful.\n\nWhat tests should I ask for to find out what issue it could be? What more research can I do?\n\nThank you in advance, please don't hesitate to ask any information I might have forgotten to add.",

I originally suspected I had Multiple Sclerosis, due to demyelinating lesions in my corpus collosum, cerebrum, and brain stem. I had symptoms that accompanied the lesions, primarily balance and dizziness, urinary incontinence, dysarthria, vitamin D and B12 deficiency, muscle weakness, and fatigue. \n\nI have had a brain MRI every year for the past 3 years, and a full spinal MRI 2 years ago. The brain MRI showed lesions 3 years ago and have remained unchanged since. The spinal MRI showed 0 lesions.\n\nI recently had a lumbar puncture that revealed 0 oligocolonal bands, which drops the chance of it being MS to 5%. I reevaluated my symptoms and had a bilateral xray of my hips done that revealed marked sclerosis of my sacroiliac joints, causing sacroiliitis. \n\nMany of my symptoms come and go in what feels like flares that can last from days to weeks. I had a particularly bad flare in January of this year and began medication afterwards to help manage symptoms. Prior to the flair I was only taking a multivitamin.\n\nSome markers that suggest to me that it may be Lupus instead is:\n\n* I tested positive on my ANA \n\n* I tested positive for my dsDNA\n\n* I have low creatinine levels\n\n* I have protein in my urine\n\n* I have a sudden abundance of petechiae with unknown cause, primarily in areas that are exposed to sunlight - specifically my chest and forearms\n\n* Bright lights cause my eyes to hurt and a headache\n\n* Joint pain, stiffness, and tenderness in my left leg and knee. \n\n* Itchy scalp, and sensation of bugs crawling under my skin - no rash or dry skin present \n\n* Insomnia overcome only by trazadone\n\n* Wicked night sweats. I get drenched. Not pre-menopausal\n\n* Lesions in mouth and nose \n\n* Easily bruised and frequent nose bleeds\n\n* Iron deficiency anemia\n\nI have a full spine MRI with and w/o contrast this Sunday. I also have a follow up with my Neuro afterwards, and my PCP. I suspect my neuro will say I don't have MS based on the spinal tap coming back negative. I'm going to ask my PCP for a new CBC and ANA panel, and a referral to a Rheumatologist. \n\nI suspect I may have lupus, but wanted to get the opinion of someone more educated than me.

I woke up with terrible dizziness, nausea, stomach pain and had diarrhea on the toilet right after. Never had this before. The nausea and stomach ache disappeared around 9 to 11 am. I had a very hard time getting anything down for breakfast, was constantly retching while eating, but without throwing up. I mostly had \u201cnormal consistency\u201d- stool in the afternoon. When I was able to sleep in I had almost no pain and normal stool consistency.\n\nThis went on like that, until November, when I switched my ADHD meds over to Elvanse. Things immediately got better, mainly the pain and the nausea. They were still there, but not nearly as bad. Yes, I know, I should probably have talked to a doctor at that point.  Things went on until I stopped taking ADHD meds all together, which again improved the situation, albeit only slightly this time. This takes us to where I am now.\n\nA typical day for me currently looks like this:\n\nWaking up around 6 to 7 feeling more or less normal with no pain, although the urge to have a bowel movement. This wakes me up every day now, I\u2019m not able to sleep in anymore. My stomach feels completely normal. However as soon as I\u2019m done having the bowel movement the pain starts. It\u2019s not constant, more like waves, worse on some days, better on other days. It lasts for 1-2 hours, then disappears and very rarely returns in the afternoon. I\u2019ve stopped eating breakfast because of this, I just don\u2019t have any appetite.  Appetite only really comes at lunchtime. My appetite also isn\u2019t as big as it once was, although I attribute this to the marijuana.\n\nThere also are those very rare (once or twice a month) days where I don\u2019t have any pain at all and my morning bowel movement goes as smooth as it possibly could. I was not able to link this to any specific diet or behavior on the previous day, it seems to just happen at random.\n\nSomething interesting I noticed:\nWhen I don\u2019t smoke marijuana I have very thin diarrhea and quite a lot of flatulence, when I smoke the flatulence disappears and my diarrhea becomes a little more firm, although it kinda seems \u201cairy\u201d, as if the gas previously excreted with the flatulence is now incorporated into the stool.\n\nAny ideas as to why this could be are greatly appreciated!\nMy suspicion is that the Medikinet somehow destroyed my intestinal flora.",

I have been a hard worker since 16 years old, put myself through college, ate healthy, 5\u20199\u201d, 130lbs, ran 5-10 miles/day, often on sand. I didn\u2019t have any major health issues other than very heavy, often long, menstrual cycles from endometriosis and ovarian cysts. I have led a fairly good life until a few years ago.\n\nI was not able to have children due to endometriosis and adenomyosis, so I had a total hysterectomy on 09/05/2020 (in NYC at one of the best hospitals at the height of COVID. My surgeon was department head, so I imagine that\u2019s the only reason it was approved). \n\nSince then, my health has rapidly declined. I have cervical spinal stenosis, moderate osteoarthritis in thoracic and lumbar regions, went from size 2 to 12 in 16 months, developed hypothyroidism (my thyroid was frequently tested for HYPERthyroidism due to how thin I was until I was 43), major depressive disorder, panic disorder, severe migraines (at least 1-2/week, vomiting if I move, can\u2019t keep down liquids). Because of this, I\u2019m not able to work. My neurologist has prescribed every medication; nothing works. The last resort is (Botox). It has been over two months and the person in charge of authorizations hasn\u2019t even contacted my insurance company.\n\nA recent MRI showed smooth dura thickening over the left hemisphere of my brain. According to my neurologist, it\u2019s very thick and only on the entire left hemisphere. She spoke with colleagues (there is apparently a reality show about how these are the best neurologists in New York). No one has seen it before and therefore, don\u2019t know the cause. My neurologist said we\u2019d repeat the MRI in six months and go from there. I said absolutely not; it is my brain. I am scared to death, particularly when no one knows what it is or causing it. She agreed to three months. This was 06/07. Even though she doesn\u2019t know what it is, she\u2019s somehow certain it isn\u2019t related to my migraines. \n\nMy bloodwork has been coming back wonky, but the one constant is low platelets, so my PCP referred me to a hemo-oncologist. My results are on the portal; thrombocytopenia and Pseudothrombocytopenia. \n\nDoes anyone have any idea what the MRI or blood results could possibly mean? I\u2019m not going to scare the hell out of myself and google for info, but I\u2019m freaking out. I am afraid because I don\u2019t have great insurance, I\u2019m not a priority.

History of total proctocolectomy with IPAA (03/2015) and adhesion-related  SBO requiring laparatomy x3 (10/2018, 10/2019, 07/2022). Currently presenting with symptoms indicative of partial SBO and consistent with prior pattern of high grade SBO formation. \n\nMy doctor has advised me that my current symptoms are consistent with another problematic adhesion forming and ordered me to stick to a rigid low residue diet indefinitely, with the assumption that I will eventually likely need further surgical intervention if it progresses to complete SBO. \n\nMy general question is what is the long term viability of a jpouch if this pattern continues? From my understanding,  repeated laparotomies every 1-2 years will only continue to make the situation with adhesions exponentially worse. Is there anything that could be done non-operatively to help prevent further repeated laparotomies from adhesion-related SBO? \n\nAlso, I couldn't seem to find a clear answer in the literature: if further operations and adhesions are more or less guaranteed either way, could I be any better off returning to a permanent ileostomy?   I've tried to research the rates of SBO after ileostomy vs ipaa, but there doesn't seem to be a clear consensus and little research specifically on the ileostomy side of it to begin with. \n\nI realize it may be a dumb question, but figure it can't hurt to ask since I am willing to try almost anything if it improves my quality of life. I feel like my life is currently just alternating between recovering from abdominal surgery or suffering the pain of recurrent partial SBO that eventually ends in abdominal surgery and it is not a sustainable way to live.

My symptoms currently are as follows: stomach pain, cramping, **watery/mucusy diarrhea (10+ times a day)**, GERD, excruciating joint pain, bloating, muscle pain, chronic fatigue, nausea (all day, every day), **bowel incontinence** (3-4 times a week), face flushing (very rarely), swelling in hands/fingers, chronic dehydration (bc i cant drink (nausea) enough to sustain the fluid loss (diarrhea)), random rash on the back of my head, and random episodes of **vomiting** (2 times per episode average). I also get random stomach bugs quite often like campylobacter, Hepatitis A, and C. Diff ( I dont cook meat in my house lol) that show they come and go with stool tests and antibiotics. I\u2019ve had a colonoscopy and endoscopy which didn\u2019t find anything other than mild gastritis in my stomach. HIDA scan was normal and so was PillCam Endoscopy. I\u2019ve had CT with contrast and ultrasound which also found nothing. Most of my bloodwork is normal other than high gastrin and chromogranin A, and some liver counts are slightly off. I am not celiac and my diet is mostly safe foods right now like toast and rice with bland chicken.

Curious for opinions on if I need to take this more seriously. 33 male.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed the last few days that I am having some periodic upper left back pain. This has also gone to my left arm. The pain feels \u201csciatic\u201d in nature, as I already have a herniated L5 S1, so leg sciatica is normal to me.\n\nI\u2019ve also woken up with some jaw pain on the same side.

Turns out that all of my issues I had during pregnancy, the cause of my son\u2019s stillbirth, and my chest pain and dizziness were all a result of Rheumatic Heart Disease.\n\nI ended up having a stroke and I thought that would change my urgency of care, but still I was dismissed by all of my providers. My cardiologist was very condescending and said my issues, specifically worsening issues, such as extreme chest pain, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, feeling a cold fluid feeling in my chest, my swollen abdomen and feet, and a hard cough, were just the result of stress and anxiety. I asked for an updated echocardiogram since I had one last year and much has change with my symptoms. I was denied and said an echo was absolutely not needed in my case. \n\nI went to my primary care who was also condescending and said it was anxiety. At the point of anger and tears I told her I felt like I\u2019m dying and I needed help. She said she was not a cardiologist but if it would help me feel better she would order an echocardiogram at the local hospital. \n\nMonday I had the echo. Wednesday I was diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease affecting both the mitral and tricuspid valves. There is still no urgency from my care team. I\u2019m being ignored by my PCP. My cardiologist gave a half-hearted \u201cwe\u2019ll request the echo records\u201d when I called them. I feel even worse. My chest pain now only ends when I feel a burst of fluid that feels like it fills my chest and neck. I\u2019m having trouble breathing all the time. But if I have a feeling if I traveled to the ER again, I\u2019d be dismissed right away just like I was before in pregnancy and earlier postpartum. I\u2019ve had this chest pain for months and especially when I was pregnant but for all the 6 times I went to Labor and Delivery I was discharged right away and never given an EKG or any cardiac work up. Same with my OB. \n\nSeparately, I\u2019m seeing a neurologist for my TIA. He\u2019s found something doing an EEG and multiple MRIs. He won\u2019t tell me the results until my follow up on 2 weeks but told me I absolutely cannot work or drive. \n\nI\u2019m truly at a loss of what to do. If I call the office I get attitude from both the nurses and receptionists. I can\u2019t even find good information on this disease because it seems like it\u2019s not common in developed countries. I live in the US, I\u2019m upper-middle class, I have always taken my full course of antibiotics when I\u2019ve had strep.

We went to Urgent Care where they prescribed a topical steroid that we can't remember the name of and they told him to see an eye doctor if it gets worse. Well, it got worse, so he saw an ophthalmologist on Monday (7/17) who prescribed him the valacyclovir but never actually told him what he thought it was. It was a \"try this, let me know if it doesn't work\" sort of deal.\r  \n\r  \nThis morning we woke up and it's spread more to his eyelid, it's almost like it's following the hollow around the outside of the eye.

Weed is illegal in my state, so I typically smoke the delta blend vapes but I will partake in occasional Marijuana and will rarely take hits off of someone's weed pen or take edibles to help me sleep. No history of chronic illness. I take some vitamins and melatonin. 3 months ago, I was diagnosed with adhd and was prescribed 15mg Adderall and the last month added on another 15mg quick release D-methamphetamine salt combo to try to balance out my days better. I have been sick and coughing for a month now, but during the time of my drug test, I had been sick for probably around a week and was taking over the counter cough/cold medicine. My doctor was a cool guy, and told me my prescription would get declined if I didn't submit a drug test within the month.  He was fine with me being positive for thc. I called on the 11th and scheduled it for the very next day. The next week I am called by my nurse and told I tested positive for methamphetamine (not the Adderall, like street meth) and Benzos. To say I was shocked was an understatement because I had done neither of those drugs. I was ignorant to the fact that the decongestants in my cough syrups can give me a false positive for meth. I honestly have no idea where the positive for benzos came from. Obviously, my doctor will no longer prescribe me any controlled medication, ever,  and I'm devastated. To say my quality of life has improved greatly after going on medication is an understatement. I have never done meth, and the last time I did a benzo was 4 years ago to see if it would help me sleep (mild insomnia). I don't like them. I understand the presence of benzos is more of a mystery for a drug subreddit, but I am wondering what my options for future care is. Would any doctor even touch me?

I asked my current doctor for referrals which they claim will take a little while and I'll have to go from there. Is there any way to advocate for myself better? They denied allowing me to retake the drug test. What questions should I ask a new doctor without sounding like a drug seeking piece of shit? Or should I just give up for a long time? I've been struggling with life for a long time so a few more years won't kill me but to say I feel stupid and cheated is an understatement. Feel free to offer suggestions on where the benzos came from. (I had only taken one hit off of someone's vape pen the previous week. No edibles. I had gone out to bars, but I didn't take anything from anyone that wasn't poured by the bartender). Thank you in advance for any advice.",

I got my wisdom teeth out just over a week ago and was going fine until last Saturday, where my wisdom tooth extraction sites were fine but the FRONT. It felt like my teeth were being ripped from my jaw. It hasn't gotten any better and I'll take Panadol around 9/10pm and 4 hours later will wake up in excruciating pain and have to take it again, and can't sleep for hours (such as last night when I woke up at 1:15 and fell asleep at 4 after taking it 9pm the night before). After about 3 hours the pain begins to come back and I can't last more than 4.5 before it begins feeling like it'll soon be unbearable again.\n\nI've been taking 2 capsules every 4 hours due to this pain, and while I was originally gonna be fine and stick to the 8 per day because night time, that's no longer the case.

I however am an anxious mf so advice and the level of danger I'm in would be much appreciated (it might be super low for all I know but better safe than sorry).

Thc edible usage is about 2 times a month to help me sleep off migraines. \n\nOn-and-off for about 4 years I have been having these strange full-body vertigo pulses. They happen when I am moving and still but seem to be aggravated by fast body and head movements. When I am having them, they will last for a few days up to a couple weeks. The intensity of the \"pulse\" can vary. \n\nThe \u201cpulses\u201d feel like a big, warm jolt through my body, though mostly in my torso and head and are only a second or two long but can happen in quick succession. Accompanying the pulses is the sensation of losing where my body is in space, a very brief disconnection from my vision and hearing, and the feeling of being very aware of my heartbeat, though my pulse is normal. Usually when I\u2019m having a flare-up anxiety is also very much present as the experience is disorienting, though I do my best to calm down. \n\nI have only had one or two instances of completely losing my balance completely. Usually, I am just a bit woozy and fairly nauseated. Also, my ears have had a perpetual feeling of fullness since this has started happening though I am unsure which came first. I also notice that along with my usual tinnitus I have had pulsatile tinnitus as well during flare-ups and moments where there is a defining ring and the world around me goes quiet. Usually this is in one ear, but can be in both and my hearing always returns to normal. \n\nA few months ago I talked to my primary care provider about these pulsing episodes. She prescribed a nasal spray steroid for the feeling of fullness in my ears, ondansetron for the nausea, Epley maneuver for vertigo, and ordered an MRI and MRA of the brain without contrast. No unusual findings popped up on the imaging and I haven\u2019t noticed a change in the frequency of the \u201cpulsing\u201d episodes after a month on the steroids. The Eply maneuver can help the vertigo. Curiously, she described the loss of sensation of my body in space as brief moments of out-of-body experiences/dissociation. \n\nFor some context I have chronic daily migraines that are about 50% controlled by Ajovy. Pain has lessened, though I still have the migraines daily. Occasionally I will take a half tablet of rizatriptan for the migraines.  also have generalized anxiety, depression, and ADHD and have been trying venlafaxine recently to help manage these conditions. I take vitamin D to prevent deficiency as I am prone to it. \n\nWhat do you think? Should I get a full dizziness evaluation or do some other course of action?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0",

Father died in 2013 of cancer, had very difficult years after in which I didn\u2019t grieve his death. Also had a very manipulative girlfriend from 2013 tot 2018. Been also having OCD since I were a kid.\n\nWhen that relationship ended I started to develop a cough and bowel issues. I saw that my stools were thin and weird. Saw my GP for both issues, but she assured me it would be nothing. Health anxiety started to get worse and I started getting panic attacks. Years passed and the symptoms didn\u2019t go away. Went to my GP so many times to get reassurance about my health..\n\nLast year in april I moved to a new place with my new girlfriend who is my fianc\u00e9e today! Around that time I felt a very hard immovable lump in my neck that freaked me out. Started worrying about cancer and convinced myself I had it. Went to my GP who referred me for an echo, but nothing weird. Could be an extra rib they said in the hospital. Anyhow, that lump freaked me out to the MAX and I developed an one sided headache at that time. It\u2019s more of like a head pressure around my right temple that sometimes radiates to the neck. It\u2019s literally always there from waking up to going to sleep. Doesn\u2019t wake me up tho. Developed (in my imagination) one sided weakness on the left side, which suddenly went away. The cough I had for years disappeared out of nothing but now I\u2019m left with this one sided head pressure that\u2019s constantly there for 14 months now. Also since a couple of months occasionally a weird smell. For some hours my smell gets distorted and then out of nothing (usually after sleeping) it resets. Bloods are perfect and did some neuro tests (reflexes, pupils etc) and everything is OK. GP doesn\u2019t see a need for an MRI because if it were a brain tumor she\u2019d likely see something in the tests and the symptoms would\u2019ve gotten waayy worse over the course of a year. Also still left with bowel issues. Never a solid stool, always gassy and stools smell bad. Thought I had blood in my stool but my GP said it was undigested foods. Also a constant pressure in my lower left abdomen. Don\u2019t know what to do now, doc says it\u2019s all because of high amounts of stress I put my body to.\n\nIs it really possible that I have this one sided constant pressure because of something psychomatic for so long? It didn\u2019t get worse over time. Also the bowel movements, could this really be stress for so many years? Doc also said bowel cancer usually gives anemia, which i don\u2019t have. Also have strong depersonalization issues for some years which worsened A LOT the last couple of weeks.. no one notices anything. \n\nI sometimes think I developed bowel cancer some years ago and last year it metastized to my brain and have it there also since. Is this something realistic or am I not being sober in this? Is my heavy derealization from a tumor or more likely the anxiety and trauma\u2019s. Last weeks everything feels very fake.\n\nSorry for my english btw, I\u2019m dutch.",

It\u2019s not an intense pain, but does vary in intensity. The only thing I can think of that could be the cause was once bending my penis down too far and feeling a little pop. This happened about eight years ago. Can\u2019t recall if I had the pain already before that event, or if the pain started after. \n\n\nI generally have full erections every morning and seem to have no problem getting one when aroused. My penis has a bend halfway going upwards, I\u2019d say about 40 degrees. When fully erect it points upwards, making it impossible to get it horizontal. As a result I am never fully erect during penetrative sex, which results in me never orgasming. This is mildly frustrating and anxiety inducing when meeting new people. \nWhen orgasming from masturbation, I often get pain in the shaft of my penis. This can last for a few hours. \nI experience no pain urinating and the frequency seems normal. \n\n\nI am a bit ashamed to visit a doctor, because it involves such an intimate thing.

Every night they'd get worse as the sun set. On New year's day I went to the ER terrified I was having a heart attack. That began a many months long journey through various doctors offices and specialist's clinics to find if anything was wrong. Here's the details:\n\nI'm 22, FTM trans man. I have trouble keeping consistent with my hormone therapy but my hormone levels have never changed dramatically from that. My heart never speeds up or slows down, I do get frequent skips (multiple a day) from various triggers like breathing a certain way or moving certain ways. It's mostly a near constant pounding. I can feel my heartbeat in my fingers and torso and head at all times, and it gets much worse as the day goes on. All tests done by doctors came back with only good healthy results (had a 2 week heart monitor, many months of blood pressure monitoring, multiple tests to make sure I hadn't had a heart attack, metabolism checks and other blood tests, and probably a couple more I don't remember. None of them showed anything abnormal. In fact, I am extremely healthy according to those tests.\n\nIn spite of that my heart still behaves this way. I have made significant efforts to be more hydrated, get exercise in, eat correctly, and it's not going anywhere. I was also treated and have recovered from an unrelated anxiety disorder that worsened my emotional response to my heart at the beginning of it all.\n\nOh, and the last thing is I have Tourette's syndrome, and one of my biggest tics is to take very deep breaths rather frequently. I've been doing this since I was 8, I take deep breaths every 10 seconds to every 10 minutes or so depending on various factors. I know it's the partial cause of the chest pain that also scared me into thinking I was having a heart attack many times, but I don't know if that breathing is somehow affecting my heart. My oxygen levels have always been perfect so I don't know.\n\nShould I be concerned? Is there something I'm missing? Is this just the way I am now?\n\nIt's pretty difficult to get to sleep because of this, since laying down makes it pound much louder. I worry my heart is working too hard.\n\nFeel free to ask further questions, I have a hard time explaining myself sometimes, and I will be more than happy to answer them in the comments.",

Ever since I\u2019ve been experiencing \u201cfreezes\u201d and difficulty processing. Waiting for neurologist appt.\nLast Tuesday, I had a filling done at the dentist and they gave me laughing gas the first time. It hit me pretty hard - I was given oxygen for 10 mins after and could still barely walk or talk. It took several hours for it to wear off.\nWednesday morning, I felt completely fine. Around 1pm, I suddenly felt really bad - extremely nauseous, hot, and faint. Starting writing a simple email and just could not make sense of any of my thoughts or even string a sentence together - very strange feeling of nothing making sense, like I was in a dream. Had real difficulty moving my hands on the keyboard and could not coordinate my fingers to even type properly. My head kept falling back involuntarily. I was going to tell my boss I felt bad, next thing I know I\u2019m sitting on the floor hyperventilating. According to my coworkers, I slammed my hands down on my desk and pushed myself backwards in my chair against the back of my cubicle, and was taking big loud gasping breaths as if I was choking. They helped me to the floor - I don\u2019t remember this. They called 911 because they thought I was having a seizure. I was on the floor for 20 mins hyperventilating - I was aware of others around me but could not shift my gaze from the corner of the ceiling. I also could not move or talk. Paramedics came and took vitals and everything was fine apart from elevated heart rate. Went to the ER, they took bloods, EKG and head CT and all came back clear. Dr said it could be seizure but unlikely, or just a bad reaction to the laughing gas. He referred me to a neurologist for more testing.\nBasically every day since, I\u2019ve had daily moments of \u201cfreezing\u201d which last 10-20 secs. One time I was eating a sandwich, talking to my husband and my body just froze up and I was unable to speak and just felt completely blank and frozen - unable to speak and shift my gaze. Another time we were walking through target and my legs got really weak and locked up, and I felt an \u201caura\u201d feeling, was unable to speak and just felt completely stuck and removed from reality.

        "context": "Mysterious Stomach Pain\nI\u2019m 33/f with no diagnoses currently. I was a heavy smoker most my life until I quit a few years ago. I am a non-drinker. I have been on a daily medication of 12mg Suboxone for the last 10 years, no vitamins or OTC meds. \n\nI had a case of a really bad stomach ailment that lasted almost 2 years. Doctors kept brushing it off. It started October 2020 and lasted until January 2022 when it very suddenly went away completely. I went from 120 pounds to 83 pounds in that time. I gained back some and am at 100 pounds now. The stomach issue seems to have came back, and I am seeing a GI doctor next month but was hoping for some insight. \n\nDuring that time, I was in moderate pain daily and severe pain occasionally that would last days. The pain was localized to my stomach only. It would feel as if my stomach would suddenly start producing a ton of gas; and I would have to forcefully burp it up in order to get any relief.  It felt like my stomach was being blown up like a balloon, even having a high pain tolerance the pain would cause me chills. \n\nWhen it would start, I would press something against my stomach really hard, and half the time doing so for an hour would cause it to ease up. Laying on my back made it worse, I had to be on my side or stomach. \n\nOccasionally it would get so bad I would end up in the hospital. I had to go to the ER about 5 times in 2021 because of this. I would try the pressure against my stomach during these times, but the pain would just get worse and then a burning sensation would start. After awhile it would go on for so many hours that I would begin to get nauseous and begin vomiting. Once I would vomit, things would go downhill fast. These incidents would happen like clockwork lasting almost exactly 3 days. I would vomit every 15 minutes the first day, every 30 minutes the second day, every hour on the 3rd day until it would suddenly stop later that day. \n\nI would not be able to get out of bed, eat, or drink because it would immediately come up. Normally on the 3rd day I would go to the ER for fluids. They would shrug and say \u201cMight be the flu? Something you ate? Gastritis?\u201d I didn\u2019t have insurance at the time so couldn\u2019t follow up with a specialist. \n\nThe pain would happen whether I ate or didn\u2019t eat, but almost always worse if I did eat, which is what caused the weight loss. I began to fear eating. I had no diarrhea or constipation. Everything else was normal except the stomach. \n\nI kept a food diary, and came to the conclusion it was not specific foods causing it. \n\nMy family does have a history of GI problems. My grandma has Diverticulitis, Chrones, and IBS. My mother has Chrones and IBS. My fathers side has no GI issues. I myself have never had GI issues until 2020. Unfortunately the pain came back a week ago. \n\nThings to note: I normally feel fine in the morning and through the afternoon, pain from the gas suddenly coming on seems to happen towards the end of the day. I have also noticed it happens exactly 2 hours after I eat a meal. \n\nI thought I could rule out Chrones because I always assumed I would have bathroom issues if that were the case, until I read recently that it\u2019s possible to have it without those symptoms. I\u2019m really worried because I lost so much weight last time around and it affected my quality of life badly. I\u2019m really hoping to get some answers this time. Any thoughts?",

I got my period when I was around 13 and it was understandably light and irregular for a couple years, but stabilized around 16. I also got on birth control around this time, not sure if aging or BC was the cause. Pretty much ever since I\u2019ve had my period though, when I take my tampon out, the blood is only ever on the left side of it. Only on rare heavy days will it coat the right side. I always thought this was strange. Additionally, I have to tilt my tampons when I put them in, or it hits a wall and gets stuck/hurts and won\u2019t go in all the way. Again, I tend to have to tilt them to the left. My boyfriend says he\u2019s never noticed anything during sex, though. I was wondering if this means anything? I\u2019m curious if it\u2019s just a normal variation or if it means I have some form of uterine tilt or something. Thanks!",

I can't afford going to a private hospital too,so the best I can do is ask here.Why does this happen?\n\nEDIT:Thanks for all the responses.I'll be going to the private hospital this wednesday.I'll be selling my guitar for the fees,but at this point I don't care as long as I can breathe normally again.I will keep you guys updated on wednesday.\n\nEDIT 2:For those who are telling me to immediately go to the hospital,if I could,I would.The nearest public hospital is a fucking joke,even the patients who's lying on the floor half-dead are ignored by the \"doctors\".Even if you get in,it's a merely 1 minute examine,since there's always a 1000 people in line.The private hospital costs around a minimum wage,which I don't have any at the moment.So in order to go,I have to wait for the buyer to buy my guitar at wednesday.Turkey is in a crisis right now,so you can't \"immediately\" go to a hospital unless you are way well off.Sorry for the blast off,it's only meant for the higher ups in this shithole.\n\nEdit 3:For those who are asking that I should ask my parents for money,yeah that is NOT an option.My father and I are not in touch for a really long time,and my mom is already in a lot of debt,and I can't work due to the obvious reason.That's why I am waiting for wednesday, to get my guitar sold.",

I also have never been diagnosed with any serious illness. I have no history of drinking (only a couple times a few years ago), drugs, or any major medications.\n\nI have always had pretty vivid visual hallucinations when I wake up or am going to sleep, usually swarms of insects, random shapes or indiscernible things, and occasionally people. They tend to go off out of my vision then disappear, but I am almost always aware it's a hallucination. I talked to a doctor about this only once and he seemed surprised that I get them both waking up and going to sleep, he asked me to keep a record of this and come back but I never did and never went to see him again. I get these primarily when I wake up, probably 50% of the time, they are very common.\n\nRecently, within the last two weeks I have had two visual hallucinations while wide awake in the middle of my day. One was a man walking down the sidewalk while I was biking. While I sometimes think I see something out of the corner of my eye, this time I stared straight at him for a while and I thought nothing of it other than it being a strange place to walk. I glanced away for a moment and he was no longer there. I had another similar situation, both of these I'm certain were hallucinations, based on the situation there is no realistic alternative. The hallucination did not persist for more than 20 seconds either time. Now having looked it up I'm thinking this is something to be concerned about, I haven't cared much about my sleep-related hallucinations in the past since this seems at least not uncommon.\n\nSome more information:\n\nI am at the least stressful point of my last 4 years so I don't think this is causing it. I don't get delusions, I don't think I have any obvious mental illness and definitely not schizophrenia. The only thing I can think of is my sleep pattern. I have never as far as I can remember had a consistent sleep schedule for more than a week or two at a time, I am very commonly up the entire night and will go to sleep at any hour. When I have responsibilities during the day it often means I go a long while without sleep but usually ends up improving my sleep schedule. My job recently has enabled this quite a lot, although I am about to have a more consistent work schedule.\n\nIt feels like this issue is completely out of place for me when hallucinations are the only real problem I have. I'm worried this is an indication of something like Parkinson's. I'm hoping it won't happen again, but I am worried because it seems like even one occurrence of this is not normal even for people who get sleep-related hallucinations. I'm mainly just wondering if I am right to be concerned about this and if it's something urgent or not. I would rather not see a doctor, especially since it seems like most diseases this could be a sign of are incurable anyway and I don't want to take medications to treat hallucinations.\n\nAnyway, if anyone actually reads this I would appreciate any insights, thanks.",

I was prescribed meds and never took them because I refused to believe I needed them. Then that kind of resolved itself, or didn't bother me I guess and life went on.\n\nIn 2021 I was again diagnosed with depression and anxiety by a different doctor while I was in an unhealthy relationship - at that point I knew something was wrong because I was afraid to go to sleep due to the fear of waking up to a panic attack. I didn't take those meds either as my ex convinced me not to.\n\nSince 2017 I've had unfounded severe joint and muscle pain and stiffness. I have a rheumatologist keeping an eye on me but so far through numerous tests has found nothing wrong with me. A month ago I was at the point again where the depression was bad enough to make an appointment and this time I'm actually taking the meds. This time instead of normal depression, she said it's major depressive disorder. Prior to that my therapist had mentioned that she finds me to be severely depressed.\n\nWhen googling the difference I noticed one of the symptoms of MDD is unexplained illness. Is that was contributed to the diagnosis? Or is it because I've had these depressive bouts over and over for so many years? When this happens to me is it called a depressive episode?

        "context": "Half of fingertip is numb after it got pressed into by a hood filter\n[22M] 5'8, 140 pounds.\n\nMy left hand pointer finger tip has lost sensation on the right side of it after it was pressed into by a hood filter. For context at my work I work at a restaurant and we clean out these vent/hood filters every so often. Here's a link of what they look like:\n\n [link](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/14823/exhaust-hood-filters-and-accessories.html?filter=type:hood-filters). \n\nKeep in mind these things are somewhat heavy and hot/warm sometimes. Essentially what happened was that I had stacked around 3 of these things together and while trying to carry them over to the sink to clean them I underestimated how heavy they would be and nearly dropped them. I managed to recover from it however due to the fact that my fingers were holding the stacks in a rather awkward way (my left hand pointer finger was pressing against the edge/wall of one the filters which is this thin metal about a couple millimeters thick). It was pressing around right where the bend of the fingertip is on the right side where the lines on your skin are. When I had initially picked them up it hurt but I figured I could just quickly move them over to the sink and deposit them and then my finger would be fine. However due to me nearly dropping them I put alot more weight on that finger then if I were to just hold them and carry them across and my fingertip then just lost sensation completely. I quickly then dropped the filters into the sink and assessed my finger. There was no skin breakage (I was wearing latex gloves at the time) but it felt like the thin metal wall may have dug into my finger somewhat. Initially it felt to me like my finger had been lopped off because I completely lost sensation in it but the feeling started to slowly return after a couple of minutes, except for the side that got most of the weight. The aftermath is this red mark/line that kinda blends in with the skin lines on my fingertip.\n\n[Picture](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZePY3S8) \n\n It's still numb now (with the pins and needles/electric sensation if I touch the area near around it) and feels about the same as the first few hours after it recovered (no improvement). It's been about 12ish hours since the initial incident. Just not entirely sure what to do from now. Should I just wait longer to see if feeling returns to my fingertip? or should I go get it looked at?",

But yesterday afternoon (around 12:30pm) I noticed my upper left hamstring was red, tender and swollen around a small raised bump. It wasn\u2019t itchy at all, so I thought maybe it was a pimple. Within a few hours, I developed severe lower back pain, muscle aches and a mild fever. I noticed the red splotch on my leg had drastically increased in size and the whole area was raised and hot to the touch so I went to urgent care. After I arrived, I started to feel worse by the minute. My fever was rising, my back pain and body aches were increasing and it hurt my upper rib cage area to breathe. The doctor there gave me an IM pain medication injection, a dose of Benadryl and started me on antibiotics (cefalexin). He diagnosed me with cellulitis caused by an insect bite, outlined the infected area in marker and told me if it continues to spread overnight or if your fever worsens, go to the ER.\n\nAll night, my fever continued to rise (up to 102.7F) and my heart rate was high for many hours on end (120-140 bpm while I was just laying in my bed). Around 8am this morning I realized the infection had spread well outside of the outlined area, I had a headache and stiff neck, and I was starting to feel a little nauseas on top of my existing symptoms, so I went to the ER. At the ER, they gave me Tylenol and an IV for fluids, ran blood tests, and changed my antibiotic to clindamycin. All the doctors were able to conclude was that I had an infection caused by an insect bite, they had no insight as to what species. The general consensus is some kind of spider based on my symptoms, the appearance of the bite, and the fact that we have TONS of spiders on our property.\n\nFor several hours after I got back home, my fever continued to rise (just over 103F) and my symptoms were still severe. I have barely moved all day but have burned 4,700 calories (as of 11pm) from the fever and tachycardia. I\u2019m finally starting to feel a little better but would really like to know what species of spider bit me so I can watch out for them going forward. My family is especially concerned by the idea of venomous spiders in our house/yard because my 11-year-old sister is highly special needs, nonverbal and immunocompromised. \n\nThank you in advance!",

She was only really sick with rhinovirus, everything else was mild. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI took her to the gp on the 18th and he said to keep a log and referred me to a pediatrician. (I would just like to point out here in Australia its not common for a child to see a pediatrician unless there's a bigger problem. Its not routine for a child to have a pediatrician they see, they just go to a gp.) That appointment is coming up on the 2nd of Aug.   \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo far she has had a headache every single day since that appointment to varying degrees She doesn't need painkillers everyday. There's no pattern to the time of the day. Last night she started complaining of a headache around 7pm, so I gave her some paracetamol, at 8pm she was crying about the pain so I gave her some ibuprofen, at 8:45pm she was still in a lot of pain and I got her a wet face washer to place on her forehead, she eventually fell asleep but woke me at 6am with a headache again, I gave her some panadol and right before school at 8:30am I gave her some ibuprofen as she said it was still hurting, but she seemed ok. Due to all our recent illnesses they have had a lot of time off school so didn't want to keep her home unless it was necessary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt 10:30am the school rang me to collect her as she was complaining about her headache and couldn't concentrate on school work.  They asked if there was anything underway to sort out her headaches as her teacher has noticed how frequent they have become. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe has no balance issues, no other symptoms at the time of the headaches that she can articulate, she says the pain is in the same spot everytime, she points to her forehead and the top of her head. She can't describe the type of pain she's feeling just that it hurts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing that concerns me is that panadol and nurofen together do not seem to reduce the pain for her. Could it be migraines? What can they do for that for a child? Is there something else that should be on our radar to get checked? I do find the drs can be quite dismissive sometimes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/tSK61oN",

But yesterday afternoon (around 12:30pm) I noticed my upper left hamstring was red, tender and swollen around a small raised bump. It wasn\u2019t itchy at all, so I thought maybe it was a pimple. Within a few hours, I developed severe lower back pain, muscle aches and a mild fever. I noticed the red splotch on my leg had drastically increased in size and the whole area was raised and hot to the touch so I went to urgent care. After I arrived, I started to feel worse by the minute. My fever was rising, my back pain and body aches were increasing and it hurt my upper rib cage area to breathe. The doctor there gave me an IM pain medication injection, a dose of Benadryl and started me on antibiotics (cefalexin). He diagnosed me with cellulitis caused by an insect bite, outlined the infected area in marker and told me if it continues to spread overnight or if your fever worsens, go to the ER.\n\nAll night, my fever continued to rise (up to 102.7F) and my heart rate was high for many hours on end (120-140 bpm while I was just laying in my bed). Around 8am this morning I realized the infection had spread well outside of the outlined area, I had a headache and stiff neck, and I was starting to feel a little nauseas on top of my existing symptoms, so I went to the ER. At the ER, they gave me Tylenol and an IV for fluids, ran blood tests, and changed my antibiotic to clindamycin. All the doctors were able to conclude was that I had an infection caused by an insect bite, they had no insight as to what species. The general consensus is some kind of spider based on my symptoms, the appearance of the bite, and the fact that we have TONS of spiders on our property.\n\nFor several hours after I got back home, my fever continued to rise (just over 103F) and my symptoms were still severe. I have barely moved all day but have burned 4,700 calories (as of 11pm) from the fever and tachycardia. I\u2019m finally starting to feel a little better but would really like to know what species of spider bit me so I can watch out for them going forward. My family is especially concerned by the idea of venomous spiders in our house/yard because my 11-year-old sister is highly special needs, nonverbal and immunocompromised. \n\nThank you in advance!",

She was immediately taken to hospital, where she was admitted for 3 weeks. She become lil alright but during the stay she lost appetite, began taking random things and forgetting, lost the bowel control. She basically couldn\u2019t do any task on her own. After being released from hospital she did seemed improving little.\n\nFor a month she improved a lil but she became very much reserved and didn\u2019t liked to talk much but the bowel and  urinal control didn\u2019t improved. She could walk only with the support.When we contacted neuro doctor he said that\u2019s its Parkinson disease. The grandmother i had seen walking faster than girls of my age couldn\u2019t walk in front of eyes. I know old age is inevitable but why it had to happen so abruptly for her. This just tears me out, the lady could carried a 20kg load in front of me was now not in control.\n\nFew days later she developed some rashes which looked painful. Doctor said it\u2019s herpes and steroids needs to be stopped.2 days later she became completely unconscious. Couldn\u2019t even open her eyes. Again she was taken to the hospital. \n\nIt had been a week that her condition didn\u2019t improved although she does become conscious for 1-2 hours a day, but nothing significant improvement despite all the care she is being given in ICU. \n\nDoctor suspected fever is not stopping although herpes rashes have recovered almost. They said it might be some cancer. Her ultrasound revealed tumor in her uterus and also some kinda infection in lungs that might be cancer. Tumor sized 6mm * 6mm  in her uterus might be advanced stage of uterine cancer but they can\u2019t confirm as her body cant deal with biopsy.In 2017, she did had pain but the tumor was 1.5*1.5 her doctor said nothing to worry about.\n\nAfter suspected cancer it has been a week it breaks me within seeing her what\u2019s happening to her. I can see tears in her even she can\u2019t talk with me. Sometime she doesn\u2019t  say a word and sometimes she say unrecognisable words which i make her believe in can understand.It is such a shame i can\u2019t do anything. I tried to make her and was somewhat successful in doing that. But i am afraid these are her last days today her HB dropped to 7. I just can\u2019t imagine myself without her other than trips it is not a single day i havent talked with her.\n\nDoctors say they can\u2019t even  confirm if it\u2019s cancer and even if they confirm it is she has like 10% chance of recovery. It read a blog online on end stage of cancer, her condition truly matches with that. I really miss her i can\u2019t stay overnight with her in ICU, i just want her to be alright again and eat chocolates with me. I know we all are eventually going to day, but why in this way.\n\n\nHas anyone faced such a issue?\nIf there is some doctor in the sub can you please guide me a little in this case?\n\n\nTlDR: my 75 year old grandmother has a suspected stage 4/last stage cancer. In 2017 her tumor size was 1.5*1.5cm (doctor said it is not cancer) and now doctor are saying it\u2019s cancer.",

I feel it could be MS but no doctor could ever confirm. Been to many doctors and 4 neurologists over the years. Looking for suggestions as to if I should see a different type of doctor or if doctors might be overlooking something.\n\nI am adopted so I do not know my family history. Also want to note that two years ago I was 275 lbs and I am still having a lot of the below symptomsSymptoms (Bolded the most important)\n\n**Finger numbness** \\- Have had this since '09/10 and has gotten progressively worse. No pain but numbness. Had EMG done in 2015 and 2022, both the same results.\n\n**Penile Numbness** \\- This is a huge issue. Since around 2007/2008 my penis head and testicles have gotten progressively numb to the point I can barely feel it at this point. Can barely feel urination and ejaculation. Oddly enough sex drive has not take a hit one bit since I was teenager.\n\n**Erectile Dysfunction** \\- Have had this since 2008 has gotten slightly worse over the years. ED meds help.\n\n**Throat numbness** \\- Starting in fall of 2021 my throat has become numb. Hard to explain but I can't feel the vibration in my throat when I speak and when I swallow it feels different than it used to. No additional coughing or trouble speaking or eating (that I know of). I have had a swallow study and it came back fine as well as the ENT looking down my throat into my vocal cords.\n\nBurping / GERD - Had an endoscopy done in Feb 2022 and everything was normal and no cancer or tumor. Also saw nothing wrong with my vocal cords / throat.\n\nEars - low grade tinnitus\n\nEyes - loss of sensitivity. I could touch the white of my eyes and I wouldn't have a huge reaction to it. Optic nerve cup big but multiple opthamologists did MRIs and no glaucoma. Increased floater the last two years but have stabilized now I feel. No major vision loss.Tests:Blood work has been done countless times. All within range, no sign of diabetes. Testosterone maybe on the lower end but the doctor said not enough to give me testosterone therapy.\n\nBlood test was recently done for Neuromyelitis Optica. Came back negative.MRIs: brain (Jan 2022), cervical spine, thoracic spine, lumbar spine. Only thing found was a small demylenating lesion where the cervical spine meets the thoracic spine. This was found in Oct 2022. Doctor diagnosed it as transverse myelitis.I had a stress test two years ago and that came back normal.\n\n**My doctors do not seem to have an answer for me and it seems the symptoms get worse as the years go by. I am here to see if there is any suggestions that you can provide or maybe conditions that could be overlooked? Is there some other type of doctor that I should maybe be seeing?**",

I would like to try a half dose to see if I tolerate it better.\n\nI know the boilerplate suggestion is that \u201cno, you can\u2019t break it up because of the extended release mechanism\u201d but I\u2019m thinking as long as there is some way to distinguish the different types of beads within the capsule, I could roughly equally divide them into two smaller doses without messing up how the extended release is intended to work. \n\nAs far as I understand there are two types of beads inside, one type that dissolves instantly and another water-insoluble type that takes ~4hours to dissolve. As long as I separate the contents into two doses with proportional quantities of each type of bead in each, it should effectively create two half doses with the same intended release mechanism right? As long as the gel capsule doesn\u2019t play an integral role in the release mechanism (I don\u2019t have an extra capsule and would have to take one of the doses with only the beads), it should just be like taking a prescribed dose for half as much?\n\nI guess worst case scenario I get a lopsided dose with more immediate or more extended release but that dosage would still not exceed my current dose at any time.

This was taken at 3pm when it didn't look so bad:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/q93vkpg\n\nAnd then, around 9pm, it's begun forming 3 black dots in the center.  \nhttps://imgur.com/a/0A6vGfD\nIt's a bit hard to see, but they're definitely dark dark purple/black dots in the middle forming.  \n\nIn between 3 and 9, she was \"banging it around\" while cooking a hot dinner and she accidentally hit it against the doorframe too.  It hurts but she's moving it around feeling normal otherwise, no fever, no sick feeling, though her headache returned tonight at 10. But she's worried because it's getting worse quite quickly.  She's trying to ice it and has put hydrocortisone on it but neither seem to be making a big difference in color or size.  She does tend to react and swell like crazy over other kinds of big bites in general, but she's never had the blister form or the black dots in the center.\n\n She's wondering if she's needing to go in to be seen over this or if it's something she could ride out?  We live in California, near Nevada.  Does anyone know what can cause this?  She's concerned it might be a brown recluse spider.\n\nThanks!",

I\u2019m now mostly OK and have learnt to deal with it and most of the time I\u2019m either completely fine or it\u2019s very mild and I don\u2019t need any medication for it.  The only time it gets very intense is on a plane and the reason is because I randomly had a panic attack on a flight once and since then I hate flying. My doctor prescribed me diazepam to take when I fly and this was a miracle drug for me! I would usually take 4mg and it just made me so relaxed during the flight and I never had any side effects until last night\u2026 I took my normal dose 1.5h before the flight and it made my anxiety worse. I had to get off the flight last minute because I started feeling faint and like I was going to get sick. The fear was also very intense. This was quite a traumatic event for me because I was very embarrased about the whole thing and I was on my way to see my family so I\u2019m gutted I won\u2019t see them now. \nI\u2019m wondering if anyone knows if this could have been caused by a drug interaction? I also take 40mg of esomeprazole as I have quite bad stomach problems (functional dyspepsia). I used to take pantoprazole and then when I took valium the same day it seemed to work fine. So I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s the esomeprazole as that is the only thing that changed. I read that diazepam does not have any in interaction with pantoprazole but it does with esomeprazole although it says that if anything it should just cause stronger sedation. I also took an antihistamine yesterday 10mg cetirizine maybe that had some kind of effect? \nOne more other thing that I can think of is that i had quite a stressful few months at work and have not been sleeping that well plus I also had a keyhole surgery 1.5months ago to remove a cyst from my ovary. I have a felt a bit run down but other than that I can\u2019t think of anything. I\u2019m very worried now that the same thing might happen to me. I have to be able to fly as I live abroad but I can\u2019t do it without meds! I tried therapy as well but it wasn\u2019t really helping. I would be grateful for any advice",

My GP did say my ears are quite full of wax, or at least more-so than normal. Which can lead to a bit of hearing loss just due to the congestion. I can still breathe out my nose during the day, and am primarily a nose breather except for when i sleep as i get more congested at night, which then leads to me having awful sleep quality. \n\nFor context health wise, i eat rather healthy, 90% of my diet is whole foods, fish, beef mince, vegetables, with the odd processed snack here and there. I supplement the basics like zinc, vit-d, vit-c etc. and weight train often. I do consume a decent amount of dairy, although as organic as i can find, i have also heard this can effect sinusitis, please correct me if im wrong  \n\nI have no other real health issues im aware of, other than heart Premature Ventricular Contractions. I have been tested for thyroid issues and all seems good in the blood work, and all my other general blood tests have come back fine. \n\n1. I have been noticing a bit of hair-fall etc in period of having sinusitis, could this be a side effect to the horrible sleep quality Ive had for so long? Obviously genetics can come into play, but its been quite slow progression hair-fall wise and despite a bit of it being around the hairline, overall thickness i perceive to be a bit less, no crown thinning\n2.

If there is a risk, is there a few ways to assist or negate the chances of anything happening.\n3. I have tried Nasal prescription sprays, and the stronger steroid tablets, combined with nasal washes. This provided some relief for about a week, until for some reason it no longer was effective. Why does it lose effectiveness in my case? For that week breathing felt unnaturally good, and my gym performance literally almost doubled in terms of how much i could lift and energy to do so, likely due to much better sleep. Is there any other techniques i could use to provide some relief like that in the meantime, or am i basically just strung out until i get surgery?\n4. Although Ive been dealing with this for a while now (I initially just thought it was all in my head), what actually causes this? I understand there is allergies, and inflammation but Ive never been allergic to anything. So what are the most common background causes for this, or can this just happen randomly to anyone? As i understand, its possible that i got sick once, and my sinus cavities may be too narrow for it to drain effectively, causing the reoccurring congestion?\n\nThank for reading the wall of text.

Normally she get 3-4 days rest between the flights, so in theory she should have enough time to rest. The thing is that she sleeps 12+ hours a day, even when she is awake she is just laying down, barely doing anything and watching tik tok and YouTube.\n\nNow I know that on your time off you'd want to do leisure stuff but it is a constant thing for the past 3 months we've been together. When I ask her she says she is tired. I haven't ruled out depression as it has been a think my whole family has gone through for various times in our lives (some diagnosed, some not but the symptoms were the same).\n\nMy question is, is there anything I can do to help with at least the physical part? Any good that might help her or anything to look out for?\n\nI just want her to be healthy and happy and not waste away (her words not mine). And no she won't go to a professional, she is terrified of the doctor, I tried many times to either suggest or help her in any way I can think of.\n\nIn the end she is an adult and will have to care for herself, I just want to help as much as I can in a non invasive way.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any ideas. Thanks!\n\nP.S. She is 23-24 and I am 27 if that helps in any way.\n\nEdit: For the smart bot, she is female and 24 years old.",

Ever since I\u2019ve been experiencing \u201cfreezes\u201d and difficulty processing. Waiting for neurologist appt.\nLast Tuesday, I had a filling done at the dentist and they gave me laughing gas the first time. It hit me pretty hard - I was given oxygen for 10 mins after and could still barely walk or talk. It took several hours for it to wear off.\nWednesday morning, I felt completely fine. Around 1pm, I suddenly felt really bad - extremely nauseous, hot, and faint. Starting writing a simple email and just could not make sense of any of my thoughts or even string a sentence together - very strange feeling of nothing making sense, like I was in a dream. Had real difficulty moving my hands on the keyboard and could not coordinate my fingers to even type properly. My head kept falling back involuntarily. I was going to tell my boss I felt bad, next thing I know I\u2019m sitting on the floor hyperventilating. According to my coworkers, I slammed my hands down on my desk and pushed myself backwards in my chair against the back of my cubicle, and was taking big loud gasping breaths as if I was choking. They helped me to the floor - I don\u2019t remember this. They called 911 because they thought I was having a seizure. I was on the floor for 20 mins hyperventilating - I was aware of others around me but could not shift my gaze from the corner of the ceiling. I also could not move or talk. Paramedics came and took vitals and everything was fine apart from elevated heart rate. Went to the ER, they took bloods, EKG and head CT and all came back clear. Dr said it could be seizure but unlikely, or just a bad reaction to the laughing gas. He referred me to a neurologist for more testing.\nBasically every day since, I\u2019ve had daily moments of \u201cfreezing\u201d which last 10-20 secs. One time I was eating a sandwich, talking to my husband and my body just froze up and I was unable to speak and just felt completely blank and frozen - unable to speak and shift my gaze. Another time we were walking through target and my legs got really weak and locked up, and I felt an \u201caura\u201d feeling, was unable to speak and just felt completely stuck and removed from reality. I\u2019ve also noticed difficulty processing people talking to me - I\u2019ve been having about 5 second \u201clags\u201d which isn\u2019t normal for me. \nAny idea what this could be?\nFYI no personal history of panic attacks or any anxiety, no family history of seizures, neurological issues etc.",

Caucasian, live in Australia.\n\nBeen unwell since December last year and had a lot of symptoms presumably unrelated to this. Gradually got better and recently had surgery to remove nasal polyps.\n\n2 weeks after the surgery and I was really noticing feeling clogged in the throat and tightness in the chest. Feels like I'm not getting a full breath of air when I breathe. No issues swallowing things down, although it is common to cough up a bit of stuff after eating a meal when clearing my throat (this isn't new). These symptoms aren't entirely foreign - I was experiencing chest tightness among many other things earlier this year and I have often had that feeling of something clogging up my throat (I always presumed it was postnasal drip caused by my polyps but am now thinking otherwise), but never so persistently. Of note, I definitely did feel a bit like this in the week leading up to my surgery (nowhere near as badly though), so I don't think it is a case of the surgery directly causing anything.\n\nI have been eating super healthily, eating considerably less, exercising daily for the last few weeks and have started on PPI's + antacids as prescribed by my doctor. He said to come back in a few weeks if nothing improves. I feel like my appetite is considerably diminished and I feel like the meds are minimising \"heartburn\" (I did experience a couple of cases of feeling like I wanted to vomit before going on the meds, so they definitely might be helping in that case). But I can't shake the \"stuck in my throat\" feeling. Tightness in the chest is largely always present, although never acute.\n\nExperiencing extreme difficulty sleeping, essentially only able to sleep when I am too tired to stay awake. Closing my eyes just makes my breathing issues extremely salient. I feel like symptoms do get worse after meals, but the throat symptoms especially never fully clear. It has also been a thing in the past where I struggle to sleep, jolting awake with a \"fluttery chest\" when approaching sleep. I wouldn't be surprised if this is directly correlated as I did notice this happening when I was experiencing chest tightness earlier in the year, but seemed to subside when the chest tightness did as well.\n\nI rarely drink and never smoke. Diet and exercise regime were admittedly poor in the preceding months, but living healthily for a few weeks hasn't had a demonstrable effect as of yet. Am doing nasal irrigation + steroid spray as part of my post-surgery treatment. Otherwise my medication is just PPI (one tablet a day) + antacid (2-3 times a day after meals).\n\nOnly other relevant thing I can think of is that I primarily breathe through my mouth as I have struggled to breathe through my nose.\n\nIs this likely just prolonged acid reflux or should I be more concerned? My doctor said an endoscopy would be a last resort, but reading up I feel like I should get booked in asap in case it is something more sinister (e.g. esophegal tumour).

I was told I have mild edema of the bone marrow in my tibias and swelling accompanying it. I was told that basically my bone is becoming brittle due to some form of stress (probably due to my walking gait posture) \n\nI sought the ortho to rule out things that would be causing pain in the upper back side of my calves which makes it hard for me to stand very long at all.\n\nAfter a lengthy conversation we came to the treatment process. Insoles - two levels to try, neither covered under insurance. \n\nAnd a walking boot which we were told was the most aggressive option to tackle this, and covered by insurance thanks to the MRI, so we obviously went that route. \n\nThis doctor was so amazing and didn\u2019t make me feel like my several plus year long pain was being invalidated.

        "context": "How concerning/likely is serotonin syndrome when taking multiple serotonin-affecting medications?\nTLDR: is it okay to take all four of these medications together - amitriptyline, ondansetron, sumatriptan, and duloxetine? Given that all four increase your risk for serotonins syndrome. \n\nI (23F) have been in treatment for a concussion/PCS for the last two years with basically no improvement/change. My primary symptoms are headaches, migraines, muscle pain and sensitivity, twitches/tremors, nausea, dizziness, vertigo, light/noise/smell sensitivities, \u201csensation\u201d sensitivity (really sensitive to the temperature), a variety of sleep troubles, increased anxiety/depression, and so on. Pretty much all of the common PCS symptoms, and a few of the more rare ones. \n\nWe\u2019ve tried a variety of medication with little improvement and I\u2019ve tried every clinical treatment we can think of - PT, OMT, SP, Cranial Sacral Therapy, Mental Health Therapy, and so on. \n\nMy only other health issues are a few skin conditions (mild eczema, mild psoriasis, and HS), low vitamin D levels, and abnormal periods (very heavy and painful, and irregular - managed by taking oral BC). \n\n\nThe only medications I\u2019m currently taking unrelated to this post is meclizine, doxycycline, estrogen/progesterone BC, iron, vitamin d, vitamin b12, a probiotic, a daily women\u2019s supplement, melatonin (sometimes), and a few topicals for my skin conditions. \n\nI\u2019m currently taking a few medications which interact with serotonin and increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. But I\u2019m wondering if thats *actually* a concern, ya know? \n\nSo I\u2019ve been taking amitriptyline off label to aid with headaches and sleep. It doesn\u2019t affect my headaches at all but it does improve my quality of sleep a tiny bit, as I\u2019ve had what seems to be some type of sleep disorder (although hasn\u2019t been formally diagnosed) from the concussion. I\u2019m currently taking 25mg daily before bed, but we\u2019ve tried doses as high as 75mg before with no benefit. \n\nI also take ondansetron 4mg ODT as a PRN for nausea, and take it about 5-8 times a week. \n\nBoth of these increase Serotonin Syndrome but I wasn\u2019t too worried about it before since my amitriptyline is a relatively low dose and I\u2019m not taking ondansetron multiple times every day. \n\nBut two months ago my doctor also prescribed me Sumatriptan 25mg PRN to abort migraines when they first start. *My doctor did not tell me that this medication can also increase risk for serotonin syndrome.* But since I take it infrequently (1-6 times a month) I brushed it off. It\u2019s weird that he didn\u2019t talk to me about it but I chalked it up to my anxiety and forgot about it, giving him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThis week however he also prescribed me Duloxetine HCL 60mg off label to aid my muscles - I have daily pain in most muscles but especially in my neck and shoulders. They\u2019re very tense, spasm regularly, have extremely tender areas, twitch constantly, and so on. I\u2019ve tried OMT and PT for them and neither help. I\u2019ve also tried a muscle relaxer which didn\u2019t help. \n\nI was excited to give this Duloxetine a try because I really hope it gives me some relief. I have muscle pain everyday, always fairly severe, with the worst days being me literally crying and trying to avoid puking from the pain. I asked my doctor point specifically if Duloxetine interacts with any of my medicines, specifically the Amitriptyline given that both are antidepressants. He told me that they do not interact and the only side effect I should get from the Duloxetine is a sensitive stomach for a few days while my gut flora gets use to it. \n\nCome to find out it also increases my risk of serotonin syndrome. It also increases risk of intestinal bleeding. I take NSAIDs basically everyday unfortunately because of the PCS pains, so I feel like duloxetine making me more susceptible to stomach issues from NSAIDs should\u2019ve been discussed\u2026\n\nSo, am I being paranoid or is this a lot of risk factors? It seems like *a lot* to me. I appreciate that he\u2019s still trying to help me, to find something that will work, rather then give up. But serotonin syndrome can be so serious that I feel like he should\u2019ve at least talked to me about it. Given me a heads up or warning of what to look out for. Or allowed me to decide for myself if that is a risk I\u2019m willing to take, and if not help guide my care in some other direction. \n\nI have the bottle of duloxetine but I\u2019ve decided to not start taking it till I can talk to my doctor about serotonin syndrome. I\u2019ll leave a message for him tomorrow but it might be a day or two until he gets back to me, which is why I\u2019m putting the question here. And because I want an honest direct answer, not someone trying to save face or protect my feelings. \n\nI\u2019m particularly skeptical of this doctor\u2019s prescriptions because twice before he\u2019s prescribed me medications that have bad interactions without telling me. For my HS he prescribed me Doxycycline without telling me that it can affect my BC. If I had known that I wouldn\u2019t have agreed to try it. Staying Not-pregnant is far more important then the unlikely potential that doxy would slightly reduce my HS symptoms. I know it\u2019s rare for them to interact, but it should\u2019ve been discussed as I\u2019ve always been very direct with my care team that staying Not-pregnant is the absolute most important part of my care and Goal #1. And I recently found out that my niece was a whoopsie that came about when her mom mixed doxy and her BC soooo\u2026 it can\u2019t be that rare lol. \n\nAnother time he prescribed me a muscle relaxer to try and get my muscles to calm down without checking to see if it interacted with a medication I was taking at the time, which it did. When the head doctor person at his office caught the mistake she frantically called me to make sure I hadn\u2019t taken it yet...",

Waiting for neurologist appt.\nLast Tuesday, I had a filling done at the dentist and they gave me laughing gas the first time. It hit me pretty hard - I was given oxygen for 10 mins after and could still barely walk or talk. It took several hours for it to wear off.\nWednesday morning, I felt completely fine. Around 1pm, I suddenly felt really bad - extremely nauseous, hot, and faint. Starting writing a simple email and just could not make sense of any of my thoughts or even string a sentence together - very strange feeling of nothing making sense, like I was in a dream. Had real difficulty moving my hands on the keyboard and could not coordinate my fingers to even type properly. My head kept falling back involuntarily. I was going to tell my boss I felt bad, next thing I know I\u2019m sitting on the floor hyperventilating. According to my coworkers, I slammed my hands down on my desk and pushed myself backwards in my chair against the back of my cubicle, and was taking big loud gasping breaths as if I was choking. They helped me to the floor - I don\u2019t remember this. They called 911 because they thought I was having a seizure. I was on the floor for 20 mins hyperventilating - I was aware of others around me but could not shift my gaze from the corner of the ceiling. I also could not move or talk. Paramedics came and took vitals and everything was fine apart from elevated heart rate. Went to the ER, they took bloods, EKG and head CT and all came back clear. Dr said it could be seizure but unlikely, or just a bad reaction to the laughing gas. He referred me to a neurologist for more testing.\nBasically every day since, I\u2019ve had daily moments of \u201cfreezing\u201d which last 10-20 secs. One time I was eating a sandwich, talking to my husband and my body just froze up and I was unable to speak and just felt completely blank and frozen - unable to speak and shift my gaze.

Got pregnant on my 3rd transfer and the pregnancy was traumatic as I had rare neurological symptoms (facial numbness, retinal migraines, auras) and the most severe nausea to the point where I had to go to the ER because I was severely dehydrated. Miscarried and had a D/C April 21st.\n\nFor most of May I was able to function as usual with some heightened anxiety. Early June, I just kind of fell apart. Debilitating nausea, severe anxiety, diarrhea daily, unable to eat. I know part of this was/is trauma and grief. Started therapy and medication (lexapro 15mg; trazadone 50mg). \n\nI felt like maybe I was doing better a bit until this week leading up to my 2nd period since my miscarriage. Yesterday I honestly thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown and had thoughts of self harm and suicide because I feel like my body is not in my control. I just keep wondering if hormones have to play a role in this. Prior to IVF and the pregnancy I had super regular periods and mild PMS. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what kind of doctor I should be seeking out to see what role hormones play in this? \n\nAny guidance would be wonderful because I am at the end of my rope and can\u2019t do this anymore. Prior to this I was emotionally stable and a functional human being. To be this debilitated is honestly tearing my soul apart.",

But when I was 15 I took 47 coricidin cough and cold pills and was not breathing by the time EMS arrived. I was intubated for about three weeks and once I began being able to breathe on my own it was clear I was in some form of psychosis. I was ripping IV's out, biting nurses, running down the halls and a lot more crazy shit. My dad recorded some of these breakouts and its actually horrifying to see because for me it is all black. I don't remember any of it. I simply took the pills and woke up 2 months later in a mental hospital confused as shit. I believe I had dextromethorphan toxicity. Anyway fast forward 6 months and I had my first seizure. I have grand Mal seizures where I full on flop. They usually last about 2 minutes and my Husband (he saw my first seizure and pretty much every one since then) says that before I start full on seizing I become real quiet and look up to my left. After doing all of the tests (sleep test, EEG & MRI) my neurologist explain to me that there was a lesion in my brain with secretions firing off and if they fire off at the right time I have a seizure. Then more recently I had a newer MRI done where my neurologist said there was only a tiny possible lesion? I dont understand how it would get smaller? I still have seizures if I do not take my medication. I actually think I have more now because if I miss one dose Ill have a seizure, whereas as a teenager I was shit about taking my medications and did not have near as many seizures. \n\nSo my questions is could my lesion be shrinking and if so would my seizures stop?

By the time I have the appointment the swellings gone and I don\u2019t have any symptoms. It also never hurt. She referred me to a urologist for an ultrasound. I go to the office and when asked for a urine sample I had shy bladder, the office was loud and noisy and really close quartered, coupled with my anxiety but anyways.

They then asked me for another sample and again I couldn\u2019t go, not once in the swelling or any situation up until then did I not pee when I had to or just have an issue in general. My new doctor goes into freak out mode and says that I might have a urethral stricture so I offered to go again just so they would have the urine for the analysis but he denied it.

That's my only current med. \n\nAt that time she ordered an assortment of labs and they looked good. The only notable number was the 295 total cholesterol. High cholesterol but with good ratios runs in my family -- when I was a normal weight, my cholesterol was still in the low 200s. Other than my weight and the cholesterol, nothing else is wrong with me, but if I stay this weight, I'm concerned I'll develop other health problems.\n\nLike many obese people say, I hardly eat anything -- and despite the fact that many doctors don't seem to believe that it's true, it is quite true. I count and weigh and measure and track.\n\nBefore Mounjaro, I was losing about a half-pound a week on keto alone:\n\nmid Sept 2022 - early May 2023 (very strict low-calorie keto, careful tracking revealed about 1000 calories/day, no meds) 16 lb lost in 7 months: roughly half a pound a week.\n\nWith Mounjaro, I'm losing about a pound a week, for about 2.5 months (tracking reveals closer to 700-800 calories/day now):\n\nearly May 2023 - late July 2023 (Mounjaro) 12.8 lb lost in 11.5 weeks: roughly a pound a week.\n\nLeaving aside the issue of \"you need to eat more to be healthy\" (yes I agree, and I also need to lose about 90 more pounds to be healthy, so pick your poison, right? I can maybe maintain on 1200-ish calories, so \"eating more\" won't work), **my question is this:** \n\nEveryone I have heard of taking Mounjaro (whether T2D or not; obviously I'm not: my A1C was 5; my non-fasting blood sugar was 100) has had a bunch of labs done every 3 or 4 months. Some of the ones I remember mentioned are A1C, blood sugar, blood lipids, kidney function, liver enzymes, thyroid... I might not be remembering them all, but to hear people talk, it seems pretty standard and consistent?\n\nSince I'm coming up on three months, I asked my MD when I should go to have labs drawn and she said \"Your labs looked good in May \\[before beginning Mounjaro\\] so you don't need any.\"\n\nThat doesn't seem to match the experience of everyone else I've heard of? I feel OK but some people when they have their labs done after 3 or 4 months are surprised to discover their liver enzymes are through the roof, or their thyroid is way off. It's a newish drug, and it seems wise to be cautious with it. Are there some standard guidelines for this, and can someone help me find them, so I can share them with my doctor? Thanks.",

        "context": "Complete ATFL tear from fibular insertion - Can this injury heal without surgical intervention?\n**Background/Symptoms:**\n\n25 year old White Male, 6ft2 inches, 190lbs, healthy and physically active. Experienced ankle inversion injury playing tennis approximately 3 weeks ago. Had an MRI done 1 week ago, the results show most of the anatomical parts of the ankle were intact or show basic signs of edema/sprain, but here is the result of interest: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. The anterior talofibular ligament is \\***torn from the fibular insertion\\*** with moderate adjacent edema.\n\n**Attending Physician's input:** \n\nThe orthopedic surgeon I followed up with confirmed the wording on the MRI report, a grade 3 rupture with the ligament being torn off of the bone (fibular insertion). \n\nHis recommendation was physical therapy, stating that it is possible for the ligament to heal on its own without surgery. \n\n**Questions/Concerns:** \n\nMy main concern is that I don't quite understand how it is possible for a complete rupture, where the ligament is no longer physically connected to the fibula, can somehow heal on its own to re-attach to the insertion point. \n\nI've seen a bit of literature/information on the internet that also says it's possible, but there are very few results that discuss this specific injury, and none of them actually give a mechanistic explanation of how a detached/completely ruptured ligament can heal to reattach to its insertion. I've seen some reference to a notion that 'if the ligament is not retracted after tearing off completely, then it can heal itself', but very few details beyond that. \n\nIs it actually possible for it to heal and reattach to its insertion without intervention, or will it 'heal' the edema and damage in the tissue but leave me without a structurally intact ATFL for the rest of my life? Most importantly, can anyone explain mechanistically how it would heal to that endpoint? \n\nIt doesn't make much sense to me as it stands. Using an ACL tear as an example, if someone has a complete ACL rupture it is virtually always treated with surgical intervention as they say it is not possible for the two disconnected ends of the ACL ligament to reattach themselves. This makes perfectly logical sense, as the problem is not just 'damage' to the tissue which can heal (even if imperfectly) but rather an actual structural deformity. If that's the case, how is it any different to this scenario where the ATFL is torn completely off the bone? Would it not require surgery to actually reattach it to its insertion?  \n\nI am not a doctor, but I have a background in healthcare and studied pre-med in college and am overall fairly medically literate as far as non-doctors go. I would like an explanation that goes beyond what a doctor would typically say to a patient/laymen. ",

This year my mental health deteriorated and I've had to spend alot of time with numerous mental health workers who individually had different opnions on medication and no one seems to be communicating with each other about it.  I was prescribed sertraline and told to stop my dose of 200mg lamotrigine so I did and that's where I'm convinced all of this has gone wrong.\n\nSince May I've had constant heart palpitations, I was telling them it feels like I've been injected with adrenaline, but this was just met with them rolling there eyes telling me it's just aniexty and to splash cold water on my face and breathe.  I then finally came off sertraline and was told to go back onto 100mg of lamotrigine after about 5 weeks of not being on it.  I was then put on an extra 125mg making that 250mg a day altogether over a week ago.\n\nFor over a week ive been experiencing severe dizziness and neasuea and racing heart.

        "context": "Extremely fast metabolism/digestion rate with other issues.\nIn 2019 I began to have consistent diarrhea. I went to a free clinic doctor who sent me for some blood tests. For whatever reason, he did not do the blood test for a gluten allergy, but told me I was allergic to gluten. I began to maintain a gluten free diet, and my diarrhea and loose stools subsided. My stools remained rather thin, which always concerned me about colon cancer. \n\nIn late 2021 I accidentally ate very glutenous meals two days in a row, and had no symptoms whatsoever. I maintained a gluten free diet with very few incidents where gluten was eaten, then I decided to test it again and ate a lunch of a chicken sandwich with regular bread, and a spaghetti and meatballs dinner with regular pasta. I had no change to my bowel habits that I noticed after that, so I went to my new doctor about this and also the somewhat common thin stool.  He ordered a blood test in Q3 2022 and it was revealed I was not allergic to gluten. My new doctor at the time ordered an abdominal ultrasound, some other blood tests which I forgot what they were, and a HIDA scan. I completed the tests in early 2023 and it was revealed on my HIDA scan that i had an ejection fraction of -2%. I asked my doctor how it was negative and he didn\u2019t have an answer, just that it appeared my gallbladder was bad. He sent me to a gastrointestinal surgeon, presumably to have my gallbladder removed. \n\nThe gastro. Surgeon talked to me and asked me questions such as if I had pain in my right side. When I told him I had very little/very occasional pain, he immediately changed his tone regarding a gallbladder removal and explained that he usually doesn\u2019t have to remove someone\u2019s gallbladder that isn\u2019t experiencing pain. Immediately he ordered both and upper and lower scope (colonoscopy) which I have scheduled in a few weeks. \n\nI am 28, overweight since 2017, was fat as a child but in 2009 got extremely fit in freshman year of high school. Six foot two inches tall. In 2009 I lost about 50-60 pounds in only 2-3 months, potentially causing gallstones within my gallbladder. \n\nRecently I have been eating well and have lost about 20 lbs of body fat and gained some small amount of muscle mass. My current weight is 267 lbs. \n\nWhile many things regarding this concerns me,   What concerns me today/what prompted this post is The quickness in which some/many food seem to pass through my system at times. \n\nSaturday, I had chicken kebabs for dinner. (Chicken, onions, peppers) yesterday I had two homemade tacos with 90% lean beef as my main meal. This was 2pm yesterday. \n\nBy 7pm yesterday I was pooping some stool with diarrhea, but there was beef chunks in it. It smelled like the tacos I had just eaten earlier, there is a near zero chance it wasn\u2019t the tacos I had eaten a few hours earlier.\n\nToday I did not have to work so I slept in until 9am. I woke up pretty hungry, so I ate a serving of grapes. Maybe two. Two fists worth of grapes. That was my breakfast. Then, I went to the gym to lift weights. I came back, and upon arriving home I start to feel a small urge to use the restroom. When I do, a bunch of loose stool is there, but I notice what looks to be a white/clear thing in the stool. If you are easily disgusted, don\u2019t go on with this next part, but anyway, so I fish the thing out of my stool and confirm that it is one of the grapes skins that I had eaten just 4 hours earlier. I have not eaten grapes for at least a week, and I have 100% confirmed that this is a grape skin. \n\nWhy does this happen? I know there is a lot here, and it\u2019s pretty disorganized or unclear of what exactly I\u2019m asking I guess, but ANY input on this situation would be warranted. My friend who is a nurse says that she\u2019s never seen a negative ejection fraction on a HIDA scan and that is very weird, while both my doctor and my gastro. Surgeon seemed un-phased by this value. Again, literally any input is appreciated. Thanks. Also I will quickly add any detailed if you want anymore. Thanks again.",

Then January 16th developed this pain in my left calf, it is constant and consistent, it changed a lot over the last few months - now it\u2019s like a stiffness in my shin constantly can mainly only feel it when I\u2019m walking. I got a MRI of leg and back, so many blood tests and an EMG and NCS - nothing!! Now I developed it in my RIGHT hip and it\u2019s recently spread to my back - not as severe as how my leg was from jan to ending of may I could barely walk without a lot of pain and walking slow now I can walk but the constant stiffness feeling is there and I can\u2019t walk as much as I used to (I was very active). If I lay my leg down on a particular side it feels heavy - same with my hip. I\u2019ve been trying to put it down to stress even though I\u2019m starting to feel like it\u2019s not possible but tbh I was VERY stress and anxious (would book a doctor appointment every week at that point). And I took a break from university and working but all from home (big change for someone who was always active)!so there\u2019s a pretty big life change - I know it probably has nothing to do with this but I\u2019m just trying to make sense of why I think I\u2019m dying or something.

At one point my feet were going red and warm every night and my little toe was red all the time, this has reduced a lot my feet don\u2019t often go red and warm anymore which is good bc it made me so anxious - they could\u2019ve been related to chilblains.\n\nNow with it kinda being in my back, it doesn\u2019t feel painful more so annoying - however, when I lay down it feels like I\u2019m being squeezed slightly / nauseous.

I ended up Doordashing for 3 months or so. During that time, I noticed this pain on the left side of my body, notably right at the shoulder and going under my armpit and to the left of my left breast. I noticed that my posture wasn't great when I was driving, and I almost always used my left arm. It always seemed to happen when I was driving. I made efforts to sit up straighter and use my right arm instead. Both methods made the pain subside and sometimes go away completely. \n\nWhen I was finally able to quit driving all the time for work, the issue went away for a while. But now, it's back and it's starting to worry me. I have a doctors appointment on Monday. But I wanted to post here in the hopes of maybe getting some knowledgeable information until then.\n\nSome other information: it goes away when I lay down to sleep at night. When I wake up in the morning it's like it never happened, but as soon as I stand up it starts again. Straightening my posture helps, as well as keeping my hands and arms either at my sides like a superhero, or above my head. (think how people are arrested sometimes). No shortness of breath. No dizziness. No strange lumps. When I exercise (walk/run) it feels a lot better but when I stop it comes back again. Taking ibuprofen or Tylenol doesn't really seem to do anything. I'm also making an effort starting today to quit smoking marijuana (I smoke extracts with a dab rig) as it's just making me more anxious about the situation and I've been wanting to quit for awhile anyway. \n\nToday I bought an arm sling so I can keep my arm and shoulder as immobile as possible until my doctors appointment. Until then I'm trying to pretend I'm a soldier and keeping my back and chest as straight as possible. \n\nMore additional information: Back in October I suddenly developed multiple food allergies I never had before. Nothing major like shock inducing, but foods that otherwise wrecked my insides and made me sleepy all the time. These included potatoes, tomatoes, corn, wheat, garlic, Oranges, rice, soy, shelfish, walnuts, peanuts, and a few others I can't remember right now. Doctor thinks it could be related to long covid. I have since changed my diet drastically and these issues aren't as debilitating. I also started going on a long walk/run every day for the past 4 weeks. (haven't missed a day yet)",

I have been given various cortisone creams, antihistimines, anti fungals and anti bacterials. Elidel, protopic, lydocain/amytriptline cream and prednisone. I have also had Botox injected under my armpits and glycopyrol in case I had become allergic to my sweat. \n\nUnfortunately none of the above treatments have helped and I pretty much live each day uncomfortable at best and in agony at worst. \n\nI have not used antiperspirant or anything on my armpits for the last year.

She was immediately taken to hospital, where she was admitted for 3 weeks. She become lil alright but during the stay she lost appetite, began taking random things and forgetting, lost the bowel control. She basically couldn\u2019t do any task on her own. After being released from hospital she did seemed improving little.\n\nFor a month she improved a lil but she became very much reserved and didn\u2019t liked to talk much but the bowel and  urinal control didn\u2019t improved. She could walk only with the support.When we contacted neuro doctor he said that\u2019s its Parkinson disease. The grandmother i had seen walking faster than girls of my age couldn\u2019t walk in front of eyes. I know old age is inevitable but why it had to happen so abruptly for her. This just tears me out, the lady could carried a 20kg load in front of me was now not in control.\n\nFew days later she developed some rashes which looked painful. Doctor said it\u2019s herpes and steroids needs to be stopped.2 days later she became completely unconscious. Couldn\u2019t even open her eyes. Again she was taken to the hospital. \n\nIt had been a week that her condition didn\u2019t improved although she does become conscious for 1-2 hours a day, but nothing significant improvement despite all the care she is being given in ICU. \n\nDoctor suspected fever is not stopping although herpes rashes have recovered almost. They said it might be some cancer. Her ultrasound revealed tumor in her uterus and also some kinda infection in lungs that might be cancer. Tumor sized 6mm * 6mm  in her uterus might be advanced stage of uterine cancer but they can\u2019t confirm as her body cant deal with biopsy.In 2017, she did had pain but the tumor was 1.5*1.5 her doctor said nothing to worry about.\n\nAfter suspected cancer it has been a week it breaks me within seeing her what\u2019s happening to her. I can see tears in her even she can\u2019t talk with me. Sometime she doesn\u2019t  say a word and sometimes she say unrecognisable words which i make her believe in can understand.It is such a shame i can\u2019t do anything. I tried to make her and was somewhat successful in doing that. But i am afraid these are her last days today her HB dropped to 7. I just can\u2019t imagine myself without her other than trips it is not a single day i havent talked with her.\n\nDoctors say they can\u2019t even  confirm if it\u2019s cancer and even if they confirm it is she has like 10% chance of recovery. It read a blog online on end stage of cancer, her condition truly matches with that. I really miss her i can\u2019t stay overnight with her in ICU, i just want her to be alright again and eat chocolates with me. I know we all are eventually going to day, but why in this way.\n\n\nHas anyone faced such a issue?\nIf there is some doctor in the sub can you please guide me a little in this case?\n\n\nTlDR: my 75 year old grandmother has a suspected stage 4/last stage cancer. In 2017 her tumor size was 1.5*1.5cm (doctor said it is not cancer) and now doctor are saying it\u2019s cancer.",

Only daily medications are 10mg loratidine (claritin d), 5mg minoxidil, and daily vitamin pill.\n\nprimary complaint/issue: Over the past few weeks/months I've noticed that I've been sweating very easily. I've always kind of run warm in the past, but not to this extent. It takes virtually nothing to get my armpits sweating and soaking through my shirt, and not much more to get my face beading slightly. Sometimes even just sitting at my desk, or walking across the room is enough for me start feeling some beads of sweat form in my armpits. I haven't really changed anything in my routine, and I've been using the same deodorant I've been using for years.\n\nI finally established a primary physician about a year ago (since I had gotten lazy about it and going to the doctor during college) and he had me do a blood test/physical to establish a baseline and he said everything looked good at the time. \n\nI don't really know what could be different, I've tried changing the amount of deodorant I'm using (in case I've subconsciously been using less) but that hasn't changed anything. I don't exercise too much, but I do go to a climbing gym about once a week, and commute to my job 3 days a week (work from home at my desk the other 2 days). Also this amount of exercise has also been constant for a while too, so while I am still generally out of shape, I'm no more out of shape than I have been before. My diet hasn't really changed either.\n\nThe only thing that I can think of is that lately I have been thinking I might have some form of slight anxiety. I'm not too familiar with the symptoms so I was probably just gonna mention it to my doctor when I have my yearly checkup in a few months, but I just periodically feel an undercurrent of slight anxiousness. Again, nothing crazy, but I don't know if that could be related at all.\n\nI did also start taking minoxidil and a daily vitamin a few months back, after talking with a dermatologist for hair loss.\n\nBut yea, any idea of what it could be? It's been getting really annoying and uncomfortable having my armpits constantly sweaty, and just generally embarrassing easily having pit stains (I've been wearing a cover shirt/flannel to hide it easier, but this obviously makes it worse as I get even warmer).\n\nIs this something I should talk to my general doctor about, or is there a specific type of doctor I should talk to? Any suggestions of things I can try myself?",

You may read my initial story and history here:  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/glossopharyngeal/comments/p8sgdv/is\\_it\\_possibly\\_glossopharyngeal\\_neuralgia/  \nI was diagnosed with GPN... but I doubt this is the case because and am more and more believing that this was a misdiagnosis.  \nMy reasons:  \nThe pain does not feel like electrical shocks  \nIt is not sporadic - it is consistent and does not fit any accounts of GPN pain I have found online  \nIt feels physical, not neurological. Like there is a lump there or something. I donno.  \nThere are no \"attacks\". It sometimes just hurts non-stop, sometimes it fades for a bit only to come raging back  \nIt feels like it is in the exact same spot, behind the flap at the back of my throat where my tonsil once was. I can stick my finger back there and touch the spot. It is deeply uncomfortable and pretty much always present to a varying degree  \nNothing I have tried offers any relief. I have been to many ETNs, I have had MRIs, CTs, CT with contrast, been scoped repeatedly. I'm going back to my ENT next week - and hoping he can look closer in the exact spot because I fear that the place where it hurts is tucked in and probably not easy to see via a nasal scope.  \nIt feels like a spot in the flaps of my \"palatopharyngeus\" or \"posterior tonsil pillar\" or \"palatoglossus\" area that hurts when It ouch it. Sometimes I have a weird taste back there as well. It sometimes hurts when inhaling air. At times it hurts when talking.  \nThe amitriptyline I am on seemed to help at first but I do not think it is actually helping, I think that might have been the placebo effect and that my ENT was just trying to pawn me off to neurology because she didn't know what else to do.  \nAnyone have any advice for me? I've been dealing with this for years, it deeply impacts my quality of life, and is a source of constant anxiety.  \nI should note I am a former smoker and I still vape nicotine. I am trying to stop that, but it does not seem to have an effect. I have stopped for periods of time before and the pain persisted during that time.  \nLast CT with contrast was in April when I went to the ER when it was especially bothering me in a desperate attempt to get a fresh set of eyes on it. They said the CT was clean, and told me to follow up with my ENT.  \nIf any docs on here have any ideas for what I should ask my ENT next week or any ideas for trees to bark up I would really appreciate it... because this just sucks :(  \nBest,  \nDaniel",

I am desperately seeking external advice after a long string of prescriptions and doctor's visits. Any help would be appreciated tremendously. \n\nBackground (a bit long and detailed, apologies in advance)\n\nI am 21f, Asian, 125lbs, with no history of any diseases/health conditions and fairly healthy. I was taking oral contraceptives initially but stopped after being prescribed my first round of antibiotics.\n\nFor the last two months, I've been suffering through numerous treatments for an ear infection I acquired in my right ear at the end of May. My first symptoms included a feeling of fullness in my ear to the point my hearing was impaired and gooey/watery discharge. I went to urgent care where they prescribed me amoxicillin for a middle ear infection.\n\nThe amoxicillin seemed to work and the symptoms abated, but after taking the last dose my symptoms quickly returned. I went to my GP on Jun. 6. To continue treatment for the middle ear infection, I was prescribed Z-Pak which I took for a 5 days. I was also given a referral to an ENT. Symptoms returned after the Z-pak, so I called my GP who prescribed me Levofloxacin. I stopped taking this after 2 days, because they made me incredibly nauseous. \n\nMy ear was feeling full again so I went to a different urgent care where they said I had an external ear infection instead and prescribed me TobraDex ear drops. I was using the drops when I went to see the ENT, and they did stop my symptoms. The ENT said my ear looked fine, so I left feeling my issue was resolved.\n\nA few days later my ear felt clogged again and luckily I could see the ENT right away. She said it seemed like a fungal infection so I used  clotrimazole and finally, everything seemed fixed. I had a final check-in with the ENT on July 12 where she gave me the okay.\n\nCurrent Situation \n\nOn July 20, I began to notice a slight pain when I pressed my intertragal notch or pulled my earlobe. Over the last few days this pain has gotten steadily worse. It is not really debilitatingly painful when left alone, but it is very uncomfortable and achy with the occasional stabbing pain. The side of my neck below my right ear feels stiff and I sometimes have a very low grade fever around 99.5-101 degrees. I also feel sensitive and get mild headaches.\n\nThis feels completely different from my previous infection where there was zero pain/itching, only a clogged sensation and discharge. Now, my ear feels dry, but it is painful to the touch. My guess is this is actually a bacterial external ear infection whereas it was fungal before? \n\nFor the last 2 days, I've been using my remaining TobraDex drops, but I haven't noticed any substantial improvements yet. I can't really go see a doctor right now because of extenuating circumstances. \n\nI tried taking some pictures of both ears and I am worried my right ear canal looks weird. Is this a normal swelling to be expected of an external ear infection or something else? \n\nI'm so tired of driving 45 minutes to see my ENT and taking all these antibiotics. Any suggestions are appreciated. \n\nOther Information \n- I am not a frequent swimmer and have not swam at least a year.\n- I have never had an ear infection prior to this.",

I didn't think I would be prepared, and the boards exam is essential to my career.\n\nThe symptoms consisted of tightness in upper throat near naso/oropharynx borders, at times difficulty breathing, globulus or feeling of something stuck in my throat even though there wasn't anything. Dysphagia, sensation of post-nasal-drip with excessive salivation. I would try to clear the mucus or saliva from my mouth/throat, and swallow but I would have a hard time completing the swallow. Felt like I was trying to swallow nothing. Drinking and eating were mostly successful in completion.\n\nFast forward to now, I passed the exam back on the 13th so I assumed all my issues that I thought revolved around my stress and anxiety would resolve, but they haven't entirely. They have improved somewhat, however. I do not have trouble breathing from what I can recall post-exam, I also do not have much trouble swallowing. Globulus is still kind of there but it feels like it's a dry patch in the back of my throat. It moves around too, for example, the prime location appears to be on my right side where my tonsils would be if I still had tonsils. They were removed when I was a child. I noticed a canker sore develop in this area about a week ago. The white cap is gone but there's a little pink discoloration in that area. The sensation feels like my uvula is sticking to the back of my throat, or that I've basically become aware of my uvula's existence and it kinda feels like there's something sticking to it. Sticking a small flashlight into my mouth doesn't reveal any obvious abscesses, discoloration, blackening, or bruising, so I don't believe it to be a malignancy. I will say that with my mouth relaxed however, the right side \"arch\" to the throat that forms the M shape with the uvula in the middle seems to hang slightly lower than the left side, but I'm not sure if that's been the case forever or not.\n\nKind of at a weird impasse. I'm not sure if this is allergies, GERD as I do have symptoms of gerd (belching with regurgitation) which has been a thing for over a decade, if I'm still coming off the stress from this test or what. I had some feelings of nausea and almost like a gagging sensation to come on abruptly. As of right now, that dryness or globulus sensation is still kinda there but chewing gum seems to calm it down.\n\nI feel like the fact that the sensation moves around kinda rules out more of the serious potential issues and also that symptoms have greatly changed pre to post exam. I know cortisol takes a while to balance out once it's been circulated. There's no blood in my sputum or dark mucus color either.\n\nWhat's the general consensus? Anxiety induced illness, allergies? GERD/acid reflux caused irritation? Should I look for anything in particular to help shed more light on this?",

She's suffered from pterygium about 40 years ago and had it removed and has had minor eye irritations most of her life. Glaucoma took my grandmother's (my mom's mom) eyesight, so my mom has always been cautious regarding her eyesight.  \n\n\nAbout a month ago, my mom's right eye starting to sting/bother her, which was not uncommon after she cooked. However, the pain would typically relax and go away, but so far it hasn't stopped bothering her. The only differences now is that she's cooking more frequently, we have some of the bad air quality due to the Canadian wildfires, and we went to Mexico, where we had volcanic ash debris (literally) in the air due to a nearby active volcano. I will stress that I don't think any of the three things (cooking, wildfire air, volanic ash debris) are TOO severe, but I figured it's worth mentioning.  \n\n\nToday, she woke up with intense and constant eye pain/stinging. She needs to wear sunglasses to reduce her pain because light makes it worse. The exterior eyelid/skin is also painful, which made me consider a stye, but as someone who has had many styes, I don't see any red bumps yet.  \n\n\nMy mom has been using a warm compress and Fresh Liquigels. I just got Systene drops for her which seemed to have helped reduce some pain. Any thoughts on what it could be and how to further reduce my mom's pain? We have an optometrist appointment Friday, but I hate seeing her suffer.  \n\n\nThanks in advance.  \n\n\n&#x200B;",

Doctor said it\u2019s herpes and steroids needs to be stopped.2 days later she became completely unconscious. Couldn\u2019t even open her eyes. Again she was taken to the hospital. \n\nIt had been a week that her condition didn\u2019t improved although she does become conscious for 1-2 hours a day, but nothing significant improvement despite all the care she is being given in ICU. \n\nDoctor suspected fever is not stopping although herpes rashes have recovered almost. They said it might be some cancer. Her ultrasound revealed tumor in her uterus and also some kinda infection in lungs that might be cancer. Tumor sized 6mm * 6mm  in her uterus might be advanced stage of uterine cancer but they can\u2019t confirm as her body cant deal with biopsy.In 2017, she did had pain but the tumor was 1.5*1.5 her doctor said nothing to worry about.\n\nAfter suspected cancer it has been a week it breaks me within seeing her what\u2019s happening to her. I can see tears in her even she can\u2019t talk with me. Sometime she doesn\u2019t  say a word and sometimes she say unrecognisable words which i make her believe in can understand.It is such a shame i can\u2019t do anything. I tried to make her and was somewhat successful in doing that. But i am afraid these are her last days today her HB dropped to 7. I just can\u2019t imagine myself without her other than trips it is not a single day i havent talked with her.\n\nDoctors say they can\u2019t even  confirm if it\u2019s cancer and even if they confirm it is she has like 10% chance of recovery. It read a blog online on end stage of cancer, her condition truly matches with that. I really miss her i can\u2019t stay overnight with her in ICU, i just want her to be alright again and eat chocolates with me. I know we all are eventually going to day, but why in this way.\n\n\nHas anyone faced such a issue?\nIf there is some doctor in the sub can you please guide me a little in this case?\n\n\nTlDR: my 75 year old grandmother has a suspected stage 4/last stage cancer. In 2017 her tumor size was 1.5*1.5cm (doctor said it is not cancer) and now doctor are saying it\u2019s cancer.",

I would love any insight / which provider to consult next, really anything I can do moving forward.\n\nAbout me: \n\n* 20F, 171 cm, 60kg (so BMI 20,5)\n* Diagnosis: Hashimotos thyroditis (no hypothyrodism as of yet though), depression\n* Very extensive family history of severe autoimmune disorders (colitis, PSC, AIH, Hashimoto's in a man, Graves, Crohn's) and others (most notably Endometriosis) \\[those are only my closest family members\\]\n* Medication: paroxetine 10mg\n* Substances: occasional alcohol (maybe one evening of drinking in moderation every three months)\n\nSymptoms that prompted me to test:\n\n* the diagnosis of Hashimoto's and depression, I thought to check just in case\n* short period cycle (19-20 days) and rather irrregular (can differ by 5 days) when not on antidepressants, somehow it gets normalised when on the SSRI (perfect 29 days when I am on)\n* period bleeding is rather heavy in the first 2 days, then 2-3 days of light bleeding; I normally don't experience much pain, if any\n* I am quite hairy on my legs and arms, but other than that no male hair patterns\n* fatigue, random heart pounding and overheating at specific time of the day (around 5-6pm)\n* consistenly low iron over my whole life (I tested reguraly), and nothing helps, no eating, no supplements, nothing\n\nThe bloodwork results (I tested on my 3rd day of the menstrual cycle):\n\n* low E2 estrogen (<13 pg/ml, norm: 21-251)\n* normal FSH\n* normal LH\n* normal Progesteron, but on the high side (0,29 ng/ml, norm: <30)\n* normal Prolactin, but on the higher side (20,4 ng/ml, norm: 5,18-26,53)\n* high Testosterone (55,2 ng/dl, norm: 13,84-53,35)\n* high DHEA-S (468 microg/dl, norm: 134,2-407,4)\n* TSH, FT3, FT4 still in norm\n* normal glucose (86 mg/dl, norm 70-99)\n* Cholesterols in norm, but seems like pushing it for a bit for my age...\n\nMy first suspect was PCOS since it is so common in women, but I am not sure, especially with my short periods and not long ones? \n\nWhere should I go with this? Who to contact? I have to admit that when last time I went to my PCP with bloodwork clearly indicating Hashimoto's he kind of dismissed it so I am pretty discouraged...  \n",

Like self therapy where I work through things myself. I've always kind of done that. Like when people take mushrooms to work through their shit. I was using ketamine kinda too but because of my medication it just makes me feel icky so I don't do it anymore.\n\nJuly 2nd I went into the ER for a Pulmonary Embolism. I fractured my leg when I was hit by a car back in 2015 and I guess I was supposed to take blood thinners from then on because being bed ridden I ended up with a TON of blood clots in that leg. I was in my 20s and not living a normal life and honestly I forgot. So I'm predisposed to clots. I'm anemic, I have low count of enlarged RBCs as well. Fast forward May 17th I tear off the tendon in my great toe and have it screwed back on. Bed rest again, didn't move around, and so I ended up with the DVT and PE. \n\nMy BP was like 136/128 when I went into the ER. I have a low BP normally, it was like 96/47 or something like that when I went to my PCP which is average. My BP and heart rate stayed pretty high while in the ER, like 130-155/100-115 and heart rate of 120+ every time I got up to walk to the bathroom. the drs said it could have been white coat syndrome though. I bought a blood pressure monitor but haven't been testing it. I feel kinda stressed and like my BP is high lately but haven't been checking it. I'm assuming it is just my normal anxiety or malnutrition.\n\nI was told to follow up with my PCP after the ER to get referred to a Hematologist. I did a week after the ER. At that point I was feeling pretty good?. I get sick and hurt often but I feel like I heal pretty fast. Probably because I am stubborn and don't like being sick or hurt or crippled for long. I hate pain killers, so I try to not be in pain.\n\nI finally got a call for the referral on Friday. I missed the call, called back Saturday, was told they would call back Monday. I was waiting for a referral letter and actually got it today, haven't gone to grab it out of the mailbox yet though. Anyways, it was an Oncology office that called me and I have an appointment on the 1st. Now I asked the secretary or whoever called me why I was referred to an Oncology office when I asked my DR for a hematologist, like if she knew. I've been worried all weekend understandably. She said they have both hematologists and oncologists and I was seeing a hematologist, but idk if she could honestly tell me on the phone, if she knew, but her voice sounded....worried?\n\nSaturday night I've been marathoning the show House and learned Oncology is a cancer dr. So I went back and looked at my blood test results from the ER and have been trying to research. I'm not a DR so I don't really understand the things I've found. \n\nHere is one article, and it scares me\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23674436/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23674436/)\n\nHere are some of my blood test results that were flagged\n\nWhen I was admitted to the ER my WBC count was 20.3k/UL. from my understanding 11k/UL is high. From what I have read there is a 12% chance of elevated WBC in Pulmonary Embolism patients. and that can increase the chance of a PE again, or them accidentally finding cancer. I am at risk for cervical cancer as well and haven't gotten my second test to check again. I should do that soon....\n\nMy HGB 15.9g/dL\n\nNeutrophils 17.4k/UL\n\nMonocytes 1.1k/UL\n\nBUN <7mg/DL but I do have a crappy diet and I'm mostly vegan and don't eat much protein anyways\n\nAST 11U/L\n\nIdk which ones matter for this question tho\n\nThere are quite a few other things that are pretty close to the low end, and others close to the high end, but not over/under. I can give you those numbers, they took my blood like 30x while I was there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll admit I am pretty lazy and lay around 95% of the day but I move my legs often and get up and try to stretch because the PE was the most painful scary experience I've had in my life and I do not want it to happen again.  I try to eat well now, I drink ensures for the vitamins and protein. I drink a good amount of water and crystal light drinks. I'm just I'm getting tired again, I sleep like 15 hrs a day lately, and like winded? I ate a good amount of food and tried to go grocery shopping yesterday and I had to hold the shelves and walked slowly so I wouldn't pass out. People were staring at me. \n\nI've also lost 40lbs since May10th after breaking up with an abusive ex. I gained that 40lbs during our 4 years together and never really lost more than 10lbs for a month or so before gaining it back. I was drinking a fifth of vodka a day for months and smoking pot before the breakup, but have quit cold turkey literally the day I moved out. So i thought maybe my weight was due to pigging out from smoking weed and the high calories in alcohol. and being lazy.\n\nLast week I wasn't feeling too hot, and I lost 8lbs. Since then I have been force feeding myself with high calorie foods, and like hummus and stuff and I gained back 6lbs but have only had one BM.\n\nSorry if this is rambling. I just want to know if I am worrying over nothing. \n\nI guess I'm asking...was my high WBC just that 12% chance thing, or should I be worried? I know worrying doesn't help. I've had slightly elevated WBC counts in blood tests in the past. But not enough for them to worry?\n\nSome cancers run in my family. I think Lymphoma. I don't want to ask my mom though, I don't want them to worry, they are extremely sick and bed ridden, they don't need the stress. \n\nThank you\n\n ",

After being at the hospital for over 8 hours contractions start to get more rapid and the woman became fully dilated. She attempted to deliver the baby naturally but to no avail. After pushing for 3-4 hours , the obstetrician recommended c section. @ 1:51 am the baby was delivered via c section. The mother was sown and taken to a recovery room. Her vital signs started to drastically lower with he heart rate being dangerously low. The doctors started administering blood infusions to stabilize the woman. The obstetrician later determined an additional surgery was necessary at 9 am after two CT scans were done that revealed abdominal bleeding. This was 7 hours post initial c section. The uterus was ruptured and unable to be repaired and hysterectomy was the only avenue deemed necessary to save the mothers life. Has anyone experienced this? Could the hysterectomy be prevented by doing a uterus repair if surgery was done sooner? Does this seem to be a good legal case of medical malpractice/negligence? Any thoughts or recommendations?",

I recently had what appeared an ingrown hair starting to form on the base of my penis shaft. After a couple of days, the bump resembled a pimple and I popped it leading me to an urgent care visit to ensure everything was okay and rule out possible sti exposure. The doctor prescribed me an antibiotic to control infection for 10 days, which I took through yesterday. I was also tested for trich/ghon/chla and tested negative for all. \n\nA few days after the doctor, I did notice a hair growing under the skin of the irritated area and was able to easily remove most of the hair without digging into my skin. Afterwards I kept taking the antibiotic and the skin is no longer raised however I do appear to have a small lesion where the skin looks to still be healing. \n\nFast forward to yesterday, I noticed the skin still healing and decided to try applying some cortisone cream and a band aid to promote the healing.. I woke up this morning and the area seems to be worse, visibly more red and it appears another hair growing out appears to be red and also appearing as a lesion..\n\nI am slightly paranoid but just wondering if I should get a second opinion on this being related to an sti or if this looks like a continuation of irritated skin due to my hair?

I don't remember any of it. I simply took the pills and woke up 2 months later in a mental hospital confused as shit. I believe I had dextromethorphan toxicity. Anyway fast forward 6 months and I had my first seizure. I have grand Mal seizures where I full on flop. They usually last about 2 minutes and my Husband (he saw my first seizure and pretty much every one since then) says that before I start full on seizing I become real quiet and look up to my left. After doing all of the tests (sleep test, EEG & MRI) my neurologist explain to me that there was a lesion in my brain with secretions firing off and if they fire off at the right time I have a seizure. Then more recently I had a newer MRI done where my neurologist said there was only a tiny possible lesion? I dont understand how it would get smaller? I still have seizures if I do not take my medication. I actually think I have more now because if I miss one dose Ill have a seizure, whereas as a teenager I was shit about taking my medications and did not have near as many seizures. \n\nSo my questions is could my lesion be shrinking and if so would my seizures stop?

Non-smoker, frequent social drinker but not problematically so, semi-frequent cbd/thc user to unwind. No current prescriptions or notable prescription history. Born with very deviated septum that has never been operated on and has not been formally assessed since early childhood. No known medical conditions. Did have appendectomy 20 years ago and had surgery on his heart as an infant (reason and cause unknown to me, sorry). \n\nAs the title suggests, I\u2019m looking to get some info as to what the next steps should be in order to address my partner\u2019s horrible sleep apnea caused by a deviated septum he has had since birth. \n\nHe, unfortunately, didn\u2019t grow up with consistent medical insurance. His septum has never been corrected, but it was evaluated and identified as being deviated by a doctor at some point in his childhood. \n\nHe has extremely limited use of his right nostril, arguably no use at all. This has created a level of snoring that is comically and shockingly aggressive\u2014 like, shakes the wall level of timbre. He warned me about the snoring when we first started seeing each other years ago, but nothing could have prepared me for the sounds that came out of that man the first time he and I shared the night. I\u2019m a very heavy sleeper and, once I\u2019m out, his snoring won\u2019t wake me up. However, it\u2019s quite hard actually falling asleep some nights because the moments he stops breathing and is unable to inhale (his chest rises and he is clearly trying to breathe, but it becomes obstructed) makes me very nervous as I feel responsible for making sure he resumes normal breathing. Usually, I\u2019m able to jostle him slightly and he\u2019s able to resume. I know it will likely resolve without intervention since it, presumably, occurs repeatedly while I\u2019m asleep and, for quite some time this has resolved a lot of my anxiety. \n\nUnfortunately, a close friend of my sister\u2019s died very suddenly of a sleep apnea-induced brain aneurysm at the age of 35 earlier this year. While this newfound fear hasn\u2019t greatly affected my sleep, it does make me very scared. He is in his early thirties and, as is common for men of that age, he is acutely aware of and frightened by aging\u2014 I think the thought of wearing a CPAP reinforces that awareness and fear. \n\nHowever, he has very extensive and stable insurance through the company he\u2019s worked for for the past 15 years and has been made aware that corrective surgery for his septum might be covered by insurance as well as potentially fix this issue. FWIW, his sleep apnea has been destructive to his life in ways more tangible than the idea that he could die in his sleep. It has clearly impacted the quality of his sleep for many years, to the point that, if he is stationary (seated or laying down) without active stimulation, he will be completely and deeply asleep within 30 seconds. It\u2019s actually remarkable to see, as someone who has a reasonably hard time falling asleep. \n\nHe has agreed to pursue medical help for the issue. My question is what the first step looks like and how we should proceed. Should he schedule a consultation with an ENT? Or a GP (we moved under a year ago and I don\u2019t believe he has one here)?\n\n(For the sake of clarity, he is very financially stable and capable of paying for what might not be covered by insurance. If he has no choice but to use a CPAP, he\u2019s going to have to get over it. Rather he feel \u201cold\u201d than be dead before 50). \n\nThank you all in advance. This has been weighing on me.

I am reaching out to the community for some information and guidance regarding the physical symptoms I have been experiencing, which have been progressively impacting my life for the worse. I've tried to keep these symptoms hidden for some time, but recently they have become unbearable, leading to extreme health issues.\n\nI have been dealing with anxiety for nearly a decade. In the early years, I considered it a normal sensation that would pass after a few seconds. However, as time went on, the duration and intensity of my anxiety increased significantly. It became associated with certain physical attributes, such as heights or open spaces, leading me to avoid such situations. Over the years, my brain has linked anxiety to many variables, causing me to restrict various activities to avoid triggering anxiety symptoms.\n\nCurrently, my anxiety has reached a state where I constantly feel pressure on my chest, as if something heavy is building up. This sensation is persistent, lasting 24 hours a day. When I encounter a situation tied to my anxiety triggers, my heart rate increases, and I experience vertigo, numbness in my legs, and bowel issues. Occasionally, I even feel skipped heartbeats.\n\nMy goal is to regain a sense of normalcy, just like I felt 10 years ago. I miss the days when I didn't feel constant chest pressure or my heart racing due to unknown thoughts. I want to travel, enjoy life, and participate in activities like any other person, free from panic episodes. I have tried taking supplements like vitamin D3, folic acid, B12, and iron, but unfortunately, they haven't provided any relief. As a coping mechanism, I find that online games help calm my symptoms, but I spend a significant amount of time engaged in this activity.\n\nI am now seeking advice on how to reach out to a nearby doctor or healthcare professional who can help me with my symptoms. I'm unsure if there is a possible treatment for my condition, but I refuse to believe that I have to continue living like this without any hope for improvement.\n\nIf anyone has had a similar experience or has insights into possible remedies or treatment options, I would greatly appreciate your advice. Additionally, if you could provide guidance on how to effectively communicate my symptoms to a healthcare professional, it would be incredibly helpful.\n\nThank you all for your time and support.

Measuring it with some string and comparing it to my other arm seemed to confirm this, although the difference was fairly minimal (maybe ~1cm). Doesn't seem to impact my circulation and there isn't any bruising/visible inflammation/discolouration whatsoever. It doesn't seem to extend to my wrist or hand either.

It's now about 4-5 cm bigger than normal. \n\nI suffer from health anxiety (undiagnosed but if it quacks like a duck etc.) and am in the middle of a massive flare up, so naturally I'm freaking out over this. I'm worried it might be lymphedema and naturally WebMD told me it's *most definitely* caused by cancer and that it's gonna swell up even more and kill me via sepsis. \n\nAdding to my fear of something being wrong with my lymph node(s), after my last blood test around 3 or 4 months back, my GP told me my  white blood cell count was elevated. Though I'm not sure if this is still relevant and considering she didn't go into detail, I'm assuming it wasn't too extraordinary.\n\nAdding a [picture of the offending arm](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/953090529061634068/1133205168717045760/IMG_20230725_030334_038.jpg) and [the strings I used to \"measure\" it](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/953090529061634068/1133205168410869881/IMG_20230725_031022_3612.jpg) (comparing the widest part of my forearms - left arm, right arm 6 days ago, right arm now).

I could start just as easily as stop, I couldn't call myself addicted. I also smoked quite little, +/- 2 joints per evening. These were pre-rolled joints of medium to heavy strength. I never had any problems with this until 4 weeks ago were I ended up in a bad trip after just a few (heavy) smokes. These were the symptoms I experienced:  \n\\- Waves of heat and cold.  \n\\- Numbness on the right side of my face. I even thought it was hanging down and feared a stroke or something.  \n\\- My legs were shaking involuntarily.  \n\\- I looked pale.  \n\\- My heart was racing  \n\\- I felt strange sensations in my head.  \n\\- I felt the life slipping out of me and even said goodbye to my\u00a0boyfriend because I thought I was going to die. :/  \nAt one point I stumbled to the door and told my boyfriend we had to go to the emergency room NOW. Although he panicked at first, he eventually said I was probably having a bad trip and we'd wait and see. He put me to bed and watched and cared for me all night. Fortunately(and obviously\u00a0) I had not died or become unconscious, but I did feel that I was always on the verge of falling away. And besides that, waves of the sensations described above went through my body for hours, although this gradually became less and less. I was extremely tired, but my mind fought tirelessly against the physical violence. At night in bed I kept myself awake for hours because I was afraid to lose control or rather lose myself. The next day I was exhausted, but relieved to be there.  \nI haven't touched a joint since and never will. However, it does worry me that something in me seems to have changed after that moment, both physically and mentally.  \nPhysically:  \n\\- I don't get well with the slightest effort: the blood drains from my face, I get dizzy and I have to lie down to avoid passing out. Sometimes my legs start to shake, but not always.  \n\\-  I feel weak ,light-headed and exhausted.  \n\\- A strange pressure on my head (not painful).  \n\\- I sometimes feel a strong alternation between hot and cold. For example, I was recently shaking under a blanket while it was hot outside, but I can also get a kind of hot flush where I feel overheated.   \n\\- Stomach problems, I suddenly suffer from heartburn which literally runs into my mouth at times.And I also feel tired and weak after a meal, so much so that sometimes I have to lie down.   \nMentally I notice that I feel very emotional, easily frightened, can tolerate little stimulus and feel like I'm in a dream. I also feel alienated from the world around me and also from myself. I feel unsafe and do not know what to do with my complaints. I've already been to the doctor for a few blood tests and based on my complaints, sugar, sediment, thyroid, hb and calcium have been tested. This was all fine and he didn't want to test anything more. My blood pressure was measured and it was relatively low.My concerns have not been allayed and I wonder if this prolonged aftermath is recognizable. Apart from the above, I am relatively healthy at the moment apart from chronic neck pain after an accident. I did have thyroiditis last year and covid in 2020 so my immune system is a bit weak.I don't know if this is relevant, but any bit of information might help. Thanks in advance.  \nLisa  \n",

She was immediately taken to hospital, where she was admitted for 3 weeks. She become lil alright but during the stay she lost appetite, began taking random things and forgetting, lost the bowel control. She basically couldn\u2019t do any task on her own.

This just tears me out, the lady could carried a 20kg load in front of me was now not in control.\n\nFew days later she developed some rashes which looked painful. Doctor said it\u2019s herpes and steroids needs to be stopped.2 days later she became completely unconscious. Couldn\u2019t even open her eyes. Again she was taken to the hospital. \n\nIt had been a week that her condition didn\u2019t improved although she does become conscious for 1-2 hours a day, but nothing significant improvement despite all the care she is being given in ICU. \n\nDoctor suspected fever is not stopping although herpes rashes have recovered almost.

I can see tears in her even she can\u2019t talk with me. Sometime she doesn\u2019t  say a word and sometimes she say unrecognisable words which i make her believe in can understand.It is such a shame i can\u2019t do anything. I tried to make her and was somewhat successful in doing that. But i am afraid these are her last days today her HB dropped to 7. I just can\u2019t imagine myself without her other than trips it is not a single day i havent talked with her.\n\nDoctors say they can\u2019t even  confirm if it\u2019s cancer and even if they confirm it is she has like 10% chance of recovery. It read a blog online on end stage of cancer, her condition truly matches with that.

I have been working with doctors for over a year now on trying to understand the nature of my symptoms. In late July of last year, I began experiencing pain and pressure that is focused on the surface of my scalp, my nose, and my temple area. The pain is usually unceasing, reactive to certain movements and postures, and can be worsened by certain things (wearing headphones, for instance, can cause pain to trigger in the area where the headphones are located). Moving my eyes can also be a trigger (in particular, my eyes seem to 'spasm' and then I feel a dull ache behind them for a bit). \n\nI am currently receiving treatment from a headache center for 'migraine', but the constant pain, as well as the attacks, do not align with migraine as I understand it. I have these headaches nearly every day, all day, from the moment I wake until the moment I go to bed. I have tried multiple medications for relief without any so far - topiramate (400mg), zonisamide (100mg), ajovy injections, and now botox injections. \n\nIt feels more like my nerves are on fire, constantly active and extremely sensitive, rather than any headache I have had prior to this starting. The headaches began after receiving a number of dental fillings, and prior to my wisdom teeth coming in last year. After exploring a lot of options, and based on where the pain is located, I am beginning to feel like I have a neuralgic condition - possibly trigeminal neuralgia, focused on the opthalmic nerve. \n\nI wanted to see if I was at least on the right track on where to start the conversation with my doctor, or if there are any other things for me to consider. The pain is unrelenting and has basically caused me to lose any semblance of a social life, and my work performance has suffered drastically. Any help is appreciated. \n\n**Additional demographic data below:** \n\nI have had the following diagnostics: \n\n* Full bloodwork (iron and vitamin b12 was low, have been treated for 3 months) \n* Brain MRI (clean) \n\nI have the following medical conditions: \n\n* Hypothyroidism\n* High blood pressure\n* Obesity (Class III) \n* Bipolar disorder (type 2) \n\nI am taking the following medications daily: \n\n* Levothyroxine 150mcg \n* Estradiol 4mg\n* Lamictal 150mg \n* Zonisamide 100mg\n* Lisinopril/Hydrochlorathiazide 20/12.5\n\nIn addition, I take the following supplements: \n\n* Vitamin D\n* Vitamin B12\n* Iron\n\n&#x200B;",

Something called GI revive has helped with the pain and inflammation. Also, eating low fodmap and lower fat foods has helped. However, even on the days I feel good I still have steattorhea. So for a year I have been struggling with daily Steattorhea, much worse with high fat meals. Bloating, switching between constipation and loose stools. My stool has been green, very light brown, to normal. It changes. I am finally seeing a new GI doctor in a couple weeks and I am wondering what I should explore or ask for tests for. I am tired of feeling crappy, not being able to travel, and having to frequently cancel plans. also note \\*\\*I am very careful to avoid gluten and cross contamination from gluten so I don't think it is celiacs.",

So he prescribed the same antibiotics for another week. It\u2019s my last dose today, there are tons of improvement, no more neck pain and pain when swallowing. And so, i decided to finally touch and inspect my neck (I decided to not touch it until meds are finished because of anxiety). Tada! It\u2019s still there, its inside my neck (left side), although its smaller now and painless. Is this normal or is there a downtime for it to be gone after the medication?

A lot of evidence shows us being safe but I just want to double check to make sure.\n\nFor one, we used a condom that was properly worn. When I took it off it had no rips or tears, no semen/fluid, and it was pretty snugly on.\n\nNo penetration was done. I tried to do it but my penis didn't fit. At some point my bare penis touched different parts of their body (back, chest, face) but never their vaginal region\n\nI didn't feel like I ejaculated or orgasmed. My partner also agrees and said she didn't feel anything coming out from it. \n\nOther things include the fact I fingered her. Fingering has a low chance of pregnancy and you need fresh semen in large quantity. But my hands felts dry and I didn't have or see any fresh semen. \n\nPre cum is another worry but I heard pre-cum has little to no sperm to cause a pregnancy. Pre cum also dies off faster when contacted with skin + air.\n\nAnother thing to note is that my GF's ovulation date (by my estimates) would be days before we did it (at least 2-4) so it would be passed by her fertility window.\n\nTL:DR: Worried about pregnancy but a lot of evidence says otherwise. Condom was used, no penetration, no semen, past fertility window.\n\nSo yeah is there still a possibility of pregnancy or no?",

Back in my undergraduate days, I used to experience stomach problems almost daily, such as bloating, gas, loss of appetite, occasional morning vomiting of bile, and other discomforts. However, after college, when I started living on my own and changed my diet, things improved significantly, though I would still occasionally have issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 2021, out of the blue, I had a severe stomach ache one night. The pain was sharp and intermittent, coming and going every 10-15 minutes. It was excruciating, lasting throughout the night. Concerned, I went to the emergency room, suspecting appendicitis. After several tests and a CT scan, the doctors ruled out appendicitis and identified it as a small bowel obstruction with a transition point in the right mid abdomen. The report also mentioned a small volume of ascites, with no free air or abscess.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe doctor was surprised by this diagnosis, as such obstructions are typically seen in individuals who have had prior stomach-related surgeries, which wasn't the case for me. Strangely, a few hours after being admitted to the hospital, I had a bowel movement, and the pain vanished. I was discharged the following day. However, I continued to experience similar pain with heartburn from time to time. Eventually, I noticed that this pain would occur a few days after consuming foods containing lactose. Consequently, I made dietary changes and eliminated dairy from my meals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOver the past two years, I have learned that consuming dairy, lamb, sushi, or fatty meats like goat meat can trigger similar pain. During these episodes, I feel as though something is moving from right to left in my lower stomach, with the pain intensifying as it moves. The pain usually starts anywhere between 3 to 7 days after consuming any of the aforementioned foods and typically lasts for a day or until I have a full bowel movement. The pain is so severe that it renders me unable to do anything else for an entire day. I usually avoid eating and stick to drinking water during these episodes, and sometimes vomiting occurs as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile I've read that the symptoms of lactose intolerance typically manifest within 2 hours of consuming lactose-containing foods, my symptoms appear after several days, making me doubt that it's solely lactose intolerance. My primary care physician suggested that the symptoms seem similar to lactose intolerance and advised me to avoid lactose or try lactaid. However, I'm not entirely convinced that lactose intolerance is the only issue, so I decided to seek additional insights here. It's important to note that I maintain a healthy lifestyle, standing at 6 feet tall and weighing 165 pounds. I occasionally indulge in light drinking and do not smoke. Moreover, I actively participate in regular physical activity, and I don't consume any medication or substances. Considering this, I wonder what other possible reasons could be causing these symptoms.",

The covid symptoms I had at this point were fever, sore throat, mild cough, and body aches. I took DayQuil sometime before bed.  \nI woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. I was really tired so I sat down to pee. While I was sitting, my hands and feet suddenly got very cold. Like extremely cold, not chilly from a draft. It felt like ice was creeping up my limbs. My hearing went very muffled and my ears were ringing, my vision started to tunnel, and I was dizzy. My hands and feet were tingling. My chest felt really tight and my stomach was cramping. I managed to get up and wake up my mom (she was visiting and we ended up having to quarantine together). I told her something felt very very wrong. She called 911. I laid down. By the time the paramedics got there, those symptoms mostly had gone away and I was feeling slightly better. They took my vitals. My heart rate was a little fast, my blood pressure slightly lower than my normal but still in an okay range, I had a very low fever, and my O2 was 97. Since all of that was fine, I declined going to the hospital.  \nI've taken DayQuil many times before with no issues. However, once when I was a teenager, I took NyQuil while I was sick and something really similar happened. I went to the bathroom, suddenly felt really off (ears muffled and ringing, nauseated, cold and tingly, tunnel vision), got up and started walking back to my bedroom and fainted.  \nI always assumed then I had a bad reaction to something in the NyQuil, so I only ever took just DayQuil after that. Am I allergic to something? Is something messing with my breathing, blood pressure, or blood sugar levels?

She was immediately taken to hospital, where she was admitted for 3 weeks. She become lil alright but during the stay she lost appetite, began taking random things and forgetting, lost the bowel control. She basically couldn\u2019t do any task on her own. After being released from hospital she did seemed improving little.\n\nFor a month she improved a lil but she became very much reserved and didn\u2019t liked to talk much but the bowel and  urinal control didn\u2019t improved. She could walk only with the support.When we contacted neuro doctor he said that\u2019s its Parkinson disease. The grandmother i had seen walking faster than girls of my age couldn\u2019t walk in front of eyes. I know old age is inevitable but why it had to happen so abruptly for her. This just tears me out, the lady could carried a 20kg load in front of me was now not in control.\n\nFew days later she developed some rashes which looked painful. Doctor said it\u2019s herpes and steroids needs to be stopped.2 days later she became completely unconscious. Couldn\u2019t even open her eyes. Again she was taken to the hospital. \n\nIt had been a week that her condition didn\u2019t improved although she does become conscious for 1-2 hours a day, but nothing significant improvement despite all the care she is being given in ICU. \n\nDoctor suspected fever is not stopping although herpes rashes have recovered almost. They said it might be some cancer. Her ultrasound revealed tumor in her uterus and also some kinda infection in lungs that might be cancer. Tumor sized 6mm * 6mm  in her uterus might be advanced stage of uterine cancer but they can\u2019t confirm as her body cant deal with biopsy.In 2017, she did had pain but the tumor was 1.5*1.5 her doctor said nothing to worry about.\n\nAfter suspected cancer it has been a week it breaks me within seeing her what\u2019s happening to her. I can see tears in her even she can\u2019t talk with me. Sometime she doesn\u2019t  say a word and sometimes she say unrecognisable words which i make her believe in can understand.It is such a shame i can\u2019t do anything. I tried to make her and was somewhat successful in doing that. But i am afraid these are her last days today her HB dropped to 7. I just can\u2019t imagine myself without her other than trips it is not a single day i havent talked with her.\n\nDoctors say they can\u2019t even  confirm if it\u2019s cancer and even if they confirm it is she has like 10% chance of recovery. It read a blog online on end stage of cancer, her condition truly matches with that. I really miss her i can\u2019t stay overnight with her in ICU, i just want her to be alright again and eat chocolates with me. I know we all are eventually going to day, but why in this way.\n\n\nHas anyone faced such a issue?\nIf there is some doctor in the sub can you please guide me a little in this case?\n\n\nTlDR: my 75 year old grandmother has a suspected stage 4/last stage cancer. In 2017 her tumor size was 1.5*1.5cm (doctor said it is not cancer) and now doctor are saying it\u2019s cancer.",

Currently also lovenox 40mg and corticosteroids that I'm taking as I feel necessary. At the time my PE's happened, my only medication was the propranolol because I was pregnant/giving birth. \n\nI had multiple small bilateral segmental pulmonary embolisms in the upper lobes 5 and a half months ago, immediately post emergency c-section. All clotting workup and autoimmune testing negative, no cause could be identified. No family history either. They told me I had bad luck and this was just a freak 1/10,000 chance event. I'm a scientist with degrees in a couple different medical fields so I knew immediately that I had PE's when they lodged the night after my c-section. My oxygen sat stayed at 100 the entire time so it took 3 days to convince the Dr to take me for the CT that identified the filling defects.\n\nI had some typical symptoms like sense of doom, SOB, tachycardia, sweaty hands and feet, pain when trying to lay down. I also had and still have one that no one can explain- peripheral edema that accumulates only at night. The clots have been confirmed gone for at least 4 months and this entire time I have been waking up in the morning with swelling in my hands, feet and above my upper lip. Thorough cardiac workup showed no abnormality other than consistent T-wave inversion which did resolve after several months. My feet still sweat when I'm having SOB and if I drink too much coffee or something it becomes very hard to breathe which is new since the PE's.\n\nI took the lovenox prophylaxis for the 3 months but still suffer from PE symptoms in the absence of clots and my d-dimer and protein C shoot up drastically every time I attempt to stop lovenox so I still take it several days a week. This isn't normal for a provoked, post-surgical incident that resolved months ago. My lung sounds are sometimes clear, and sometimes obstructed for no discernible reason. Upon looking at the CT's myself I discovered what I believe to be vasculitis and started self-treating with decadron or prednisolone I had at home which helps my pain and breathing tremendously. I'm waiting for follow-up with pulmonology for them to review my scans. The Albuterol they gave me at initial visit did not help.

My symptoms come back when I reduce or stop steroids which I've been taking for about 2 weeks now.\n\nAll of the specialists I've seen are stumped as to what is happening to me.

Please let me know if I don\u2019t cover any relevant info. \n\n\nMe: 30\u2019s F, 5\u201910\u201d, 285 lbs. Retail worker. I was walking 5+ miles a day at work with no issues prior to this incident. \n\n\nIncident: While at work I was using a hydraulic lift cart to load merchandise into a customers vehicle. The merchandise was about 200lbs. The cart has a flat bed and a handle at the back for steering and the bed raises/lowers with a foot pump. \n\n\nThe customer stopped halfway backed in and was trying to speak to me. I locked the cart and stepped off the curb to hear him. While speaking to him I heard a noise, almost simultaneously he said \u201coh shit lookout\u201d and I felt something slam into my shin and land on my foot. \n\n\nThe cart had rolled off the 6-8inch curb, tilted forward and launched the 200lbs box into/onto my foot. The cart was elevated so this box fell about 3 feet. \n\n\nThe customer had to help me get the box off my foot and when I attempted to walk my leg buckled and I sort of kneel fell. \n\n\n\nThe injury:\nI was wearing composite toe work boots so the arch of my foot ended up taking the brunt of the impact. Immediately my ankle swelled but the bruising was fairly minor. It hurt to walk, specifically it hurt to go from toe to heel in a normal walking motion. \n\n\nI went to an urgent care the day after (there were difficulties getting paperwork from them). They did x rays and identified a minor fracture of the medial malleolus and put me in a walking boot.  I attempted to return to work in the boot but the pain was awful and not helped by OTC pain relief. \n\n\nThis occurred about four months ago and I am still dealing with pain and a very loud clicking/popping noise with each step. I have been doing PT. An MRI and was done and found nothing significant except that I have a spare foot bone/os trigonium. \n\n\nObviously this ended up going through workers comp. I am seeing a podiatrist who does not want to address the clicking nose and is of the opinion that I am recovering well. \n\n\nI am frustrated because the popping noise is constant and painful. I feel like something is out of place in my foot and that this will worsen with time. \n\n\nTLDR; foot got crushed. Minor fracture to the medial malleolus. Os trigonium/spare bone present. Four months on foot making loud, constant popping noise when walking, painful. I am a layperson but the pain/noise is around the superior/inferior extensor retinaculum and radiates up the left/outside of my shin (left foot). There is also nerve damage and numbness that comes and goes. \n\n\nWhat could be causing this?  Is there a test or type of imaging to further investigate? They want me to settle but I am concerned this will need surgery down the road.  I am pending a second opinion appt. \n\n\nThanks for reading! I will gladly answer any questions.",

I went on antipsychotics for under half a year before tapering off with heavy use of supplements, and was fine for another half a year before experiencing this relapse which lasted approximately 2 months. The initial triggering factor was intense interpersonal stress and isolation during covid. I was MRI scanned initially and told nothing was found. The character of delusions being thought transmitting and occasionally the sensation of being another person. This has ceased thankfully.\n\nNow, I'm aware of the potential for my diagnosis to be early schizophrenia and will stay on medication for a longer period prior to any discussion of tapering. However, I have physical complaints in an electrical tingling sensation felt at the back of the head during these experiences leading me to think this is a treatable neurochemical disorder. the uncomfortable sensation is in the occipital lobe/back of the head by the cerebellum and often spreads across the head into a general sensation of lightheadedness. This sensation is the chief priming factor for delusional thinking. \n\nHow do I treat this?

There\u2019s a lot to this \u201cstory\u201d but I\u2019ll try to keep it short.\n\nAfter MULTIPLE conversations with my mom, dad, siblings, & extended family members, I decided to go with my mom to see her PCP. This first appointment was right around a year or so ago. I explained our concerns to her doctor, he examined her, asked her several questions. \n\nShe shared that she knew what she wanted to say, she just couldn\u2019t seem to get the words out. She blamed her behavioral and emotional changes on her inability to communicate the way she wanted to. Which is understandable given that my mom has always been very outgoing, social, & the \u201calpha dog\u201d in our family. \n\nThe doctor\u2019s explanation was worded \u201cif you don\u2019t use it, you lose it\u201d \u2026 meaning that during the pandemic & months following, she was communicating FAR less than usual & it took a toll on her speech. He concluded that she likely had aphasia\u2014specifically Broca\u2019s Aphasia. He recommended speech therapy, a CT scan, & seeing a neurologist. \n\nMy mom refused speech therapy. She still does. But she agreed to the rest. \n\nThe CT scan revealed a minor stroke, which we initially believed to be the cause of all her symptoms. But then she got an MRI & finally got in to see a neurologist. This appointment was a few months ago. \n\nThe neurologist looked at her MRI, her CT scan, her chart, etc\u2026 basically everything. He conducted several tests in his office & examined her himself. Then he told us: mom\u2019s frontal lobe is deteriorating. She has primary progressive aphasia, a type of dementia. \n\nA few points he made:\n- The stroke was completely unrelated. \n- She\u2019s not going to get better & there\u2019s no way to know how quickly she\u2019ll get worse, but she WILL get worse. \n- If she\u2019s adamant about not doing speech therapy, it\u2019s okay to let it go. It might slow the progression of her speech troubles, or it might not, but it wouldn\u2019t improve them. \n\nFor the last year, i & my family have been grieving someone who is still very much alive. It\u2019s heartbreaking, but I try to focus on the fact that we\u2019re lucky to still have her, even if she\u2019s completely different than she was just a couple years ago.",

I am desperately seeking external advice after a long string of prescriptions and doctor's visits. Any help would be appreciated tremendously. \n\nBackground (a bit long and detailed, apologies in advance)\n\nI am 21f, Asian, 125lbs, with no history of any diseases/health conditions and fairly healthy. I was taking oral contraceptives initially but stopped after being prescribed my first round of antibiotics.\n\nFor the last two months, I've been suffering through numerous treatments for an ear infection I acquired in my right ear at the end of May. My first symptoms included a feeling of fullness in my ear to the point my hearing was impaired and gooey/watery discharge. I went to urgent care where they prescribed me amoxicillin for a middle ear infection.\n\nThe amoxicillin seemed to work and the symptoms abated, but after taking the last dose my symptoms quickly returned. I went to my GP on Jun. 6. To continue treatment for the middle ear infection, I was prescribed Z-Pak which I took for a 5 days. I was also given a referral to an ENT. Symptoms returned after the Z-pak, so I called my GP who prescribed me Levofloxacin. I stopped taking this after 2 days, because they made me incredibly nauseous. \n\nMy ear was feeling full again so I went to a different urgent care where they said I had an external ear infection instead and prescribed me TobraDex ear drops. I was using the drops when I went to see the ENT, and they did stop my symptoms. The ENT said my ear looked fine, so I left feeling my issue was resolved.\n\nA few days later my ear felt clogged again and luckily I could see the ENT right away. She said it seemed like a fungal infection so I used  clotrimazole and finally, everything seemed fixed. I had a final check-in with the ENT on July 12 where she gave me the okay.\n\nCurrent Situation \n\nOn July 20, I began to notice a slight pain when I pressed my intertragal notch or pulled my earlobe. Over the last few days this pain has gotten steadily worse. It is not really debilitatingly painful when left alone, but it is very uncomfortable and achy with the occasional stabbing pain. The side of my neck below my right ear feels stiff and I sometimes have a very low grade fever around 99.5-101 degrees. I also feel sensitive and get mild headaches.\n\nThis feels completely different from my previous infection where there was zero pain/itching, only a clogged sensation and discharge. Now, my ear feels dry, but it is painful to the touch. My guess is this is actually a bacterial external ear infection whereas it was fungal before? \n\nFor the last 2 days, I've been using my remaining TobraDex drops, but I haven't noticed any substantial improvements yet. I can't really go see a doctor right now because of extenuating circumstances. \n\nI tried taking some pictures of both ears and I am worried my right ear canal looks weird. Is this a normal swelling to be expected of an external ear infection or something else? \n\nI'm so tired of driving 45 minutes to see my ENT and taking all these antibiotics. Any suggestions are appreciated. \n\nOther Information \n- I am not a frequent swimmer and have not swam at least a year.\n- I have never had an ear infection prior to this.",

The constant tinnitus is in both ears, though the left ear is often louder and sometimes has an additional tone.\n\n**Details about the pulsatile tinnitus:** The tinnitus is usually constant, but becomes pulsatile when I:\n\n* **Bend over** \\- I'll get about 5 seconds of pulse-synchronous whooshing in both ears. It's not a low-pitched ultrasound noise, it's like my hissing tinnitus pulsing along to my heart (ssssSSSSsssSSSssSSSsssSSS)\n* **Stand up quickly** \\- Again, about 5 seconds of pulse-synchronous whooshing in both ears\n* **Turn my head all the way to the right** \\- Same, about 5 seconds of the whooshing\n\nIf I maintain the positions above, after the 5-ish seconds, the pulsing stops and the tinnitus hisses normally, non-pulsatile. If I'm upset, it can take longer.\n\nOther times it is pulsatile is doing hard cardio **exercise**... this is when it pulses the most, I hear 3-5 seconds of whooshing (both ears) on every other exhale when my heart rate is raised and pumping hard. Otherwise, I feel GREAT when I exercise, my heart rate recovers quickly when I stop, no headaches or weakness, etc.\n\nSometimes, I hear the pulsing inside my tinnitus when I first wake up in the morning, or when I wake up from a vivid dream. This can sometimes take a little while to calm down and is sometimes louder, or only, in the left ear.\n\nThe constant tinnitus is extremely somatic. I can make it louder by turning my head to the right, bending my neck all the way back, pushing on my forehead, jutting my jaw out, etc. I can even 'fake' the exact sound it makes when it's actually pulse-synchronous by doing these movements... the sound is the same.\n\n**The weirdest thing:** during the times the tinnitus is pulsing, I can STOP the pulsing by closing my teeth together. I CANNOT stop the pulsing by pressing anywhere on my neck or throat (I know that's a common test for vascular PT)  I also cannot make a recording of the pulsing, which tells me it is probably a subjective noise and not 'real'.\n\n**Duration of Complaint:** 2-3 years, I don't know exactly, but it's been going on for quite a long time.\n\n**Factors to Consider:** I have a history of going to air shows and concerts without ear protection. I also used to work wedding receptions. For the last several years I have been using AirPods on my 6-7 mile daily walks, and I definitely had the music up way too loud to hear over traffic/outside noise. I know this is why I have the constant tinnitus. What I don't understand is why it is sometimes pulsatile. I protect my hearing now.\n\n**Tests I have had:**\n\n* **Brain MRI, with and without contrast, with IAC protocol:** totally clear and 'normal'\n* **Blood tests:** not anemic, liver and kidney function fine, thyroid levels are normal. Vitamin levels were not tested.\n* **Blood Pressure:** runs low if anything, has never been elevated when measured\n* **Hearing Test:** All thresholds normal, symmetrical hearing, including some extended high frequencies tested\n* **LDL/Tympanometry:** Normal LDLs and normal pressures\n* **Vestibular tests:** found a slight unilateral hypofunction on the RIGHT side, which is my 'better' tinnitus ear.. test was done to diagnose 24/7 rocking dizziness for a few months post-COVID infection. I've since 'compensated' for this and no longer feel dizzy.\n* **Chest CTA/EKG/Echocardiogram:** These were done last month because of a bad septic pneumonia infection, not because of the pulsatile tinnitus, but everything was perfect so I'm including it here just to mention that there probably isn't a cardiac concern.\n* **Eye Exam:** included digital images of my optic nerves, no papilledema seen\n\nI never cared about the noise before until I started being anxious about it, but now it causes me a great deal of anxiety and I listen to it constantly. I feel like I can habituate to it again if I could remove the anxiety that something is really wrong, since Googling 'pulsatile tinnitus' leads you down some scary rabbit holes, which is why I started seeking a doctor to begin with.\n\nI've been seeing an ENT/Neurotologist specialist, who I thought would be the best person for this due to his hyper-specialty but he seems unconcerned about my specific symptoms? I had to push for even the standard contrast brain MRI. He thinks if my PT was anything super concerning it would only ever appear in one ear and would be a more constant 24/7 thing.\n\nI think all of you doctors on here are so generous with your time and expertise, and I'm hoping you can give me some basic advice... **with my specific symptoms should I just put this to rest, or should I be seeking more scans ( brain MRA or carotid ultrasound?) And how urgently should I be seeking this out?**\n\n**Major Concerns:** a dural arteriovenous fistula, carotid cavernous fistula, or an aneurysm. I know the scan that I had wouldn't be able to fully diagnose those things, but would it at least raise any red flags that would give my doctor reason for further testing?\n\nI'm really, really struggling with the anxiety. It's led me to restart Prozac after saying, years ago, that I'd never go back on another SSRI.",

I went to urgent care a few days later once I was able to get out of bed. They tested me for everything in a regular STI panel. All negative except BV and Trich. I wasn\u2019t really experiencing symptoms just slight burning and paranoia because I did not recall anything from that night or exactly what was done to me. I had a cold sore at the time (HSV1 positive since I was 8) so it freaked me out that it spread and I asked to get tested for HSV. They didn\u2019t swab me but did blood test instead. Never heard back from them. 4 weeks passed and I decided to look up my results and saw I got a low positive for HSV2. Immediately I started to freak out. Few days later I started experiencing the following symptoms :\nLower back pain, leg pain, back and leg tingling, a burning skin sensation all over my pelvic area including Mons pubis and hips that goes down my legs and knees. I kept vigorously checking myself for sores and started having left labia pain, prickling and tingling. No lesions or sores ever appeared. Sometimes my hips hurt like they were displaced and my tailbone aches. These feelings are constant all day. \n\nI went through the rabbit hole of HSV testing and learned about false positives. 12 weeks after the incident I paid for the western blot and I was positive for hsv1 (which is known) and negative for hsv2. I also got multiple swabs in areas that I thought were red or irritated. All negative.\n\nHowever, my symptoms persist and doctors don\u2019t know what to tell me anymore. \n\nSo far I\u2019ve had:\nBack ct, pelvic mri, brain mri (to rule out ms) I do have spinal stenosis and some bulging discs. Got sent to physical therapy and it helped a little. Steroids did nothing. \n\nEach time I have a \u201cflare up\u201d it lasts months. The first one lasted for almost 3 months. I am now going on 4 weeks of this nerve pain, pricking all over my pelvic/genital area/ back pain, hip pain. \n\nMy neurologist thinks I have fibromyalgia as sometimes the burning spreads to my ribs and arms but it\u2019s mostly constant on the lower half of my body.\n\nI am uncomfortable and miserable where i can\u2019t even wear certain clothes because they just hurt or make me feel a weird scrappy feeling all over my legs and pelvic area. Gabapentin doesn\u2019t do much or I don\u2019t take enough. I literally can\u2019t live my life normally anymore. I have 2 little boys and all I can ever do is sit or lay because that\u2019s the only time it\u2019s not hurting so bad. I feel like I\u2019m failing. \n\nWhat can this be? What doctor should I see next? \n\nI still get worried my HSV tests were somehow wrong\u2026 but I\u2019ve never had a \u201coutbreak\u201d even after weeks of symptoms. I just want it to go away. \n\nAny help appreciated.",

Hope you're having a better day than I have! \n\nSo here's my problem, I'm 32 Female, 165pounds / 74kg, 5'5\" / 165m, I don't smoke, and I drink very occasionally (1 to 4 drinks Friday and Saturday), and I don't take any medication, nor have any conditions that I know of.\n\nSo, since 2019 I've noticed that my feet would get swollen if the temperature goes further up than 28\u00b0C/ 82\u00b0F, it doesn't matter the country, the humidity, if it's city or beach, how much I walk, or been on my feet, or any other conditions... They will get swollen and hurt like a mother effer cause of how swollen they get.\n\nThe past few days I've been on holiday and since I've arrived there's not been 1 day that I can enjoy sightseeing or walking or doing touristy things cause my feet hurt so much.\nI've been taking water retention pills as prescribed by my pharmacist and they haven't helped at all with the issue. \n\nAt nights or whenever i can I would put my feet up, and at night against the wall for the swellness to decrease, and it does so I'll sleep okay and with my normal feet, then I will wake up and I kid you not, 30 minutes on my feet and BAM - puffy swollen feet again. Whenever I had swollen feet before, this has never ever happened for the amount of time this time around has happened.\n\nI don't know what to do, if you can help me I would be very very grateful!

I feel disfigured, and also worry that there is an unidentified underlying cause. \n\nI developed my first facial angiofibroma (nose) 10 years ago. 2 years ago, when I finally went to a derm about them, I had 8, including one that was in a location that caused it to ulcerate frequently. They are located in the \"butterfly\" facial pattern and on my forehead. The derm was concerned it may be Tuberous Sclerosis or Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia, so I got genetic testing. The genetic counselor identified a CHEK2 mutation and told me it was not the cause of the angiofibromas.\n\nIn the past 2 years, I have developed many more angiofibromas. I'm up to 18 now. The derm will not remove them. What are other possible causes of this? ",

        "context": "(25M) More than six months of diarrhea, loose stools, and nausea. I need help.\nHello, \n\nI would like to ask for your help or advice. I have never had any problems with my stomach or digestion, even though I sometimes went to the bathroom more frequently, usually due to stress, stool was normal. However, this is a different case. At the end of November 2022, one morning, I woke up with diarrhea and spent the whole day sitting on the toilet. The stool was completely watery, and I had never experienced anything like this before. The next day, I felt better, but in the following days, I still had loose and watery stools. Whenever I ate something, within a few minutes, my stomach started rumbling, and I had to go to the bathroom again. The same thing happened when I was lying flat on my bed, with an awful rumbling sensation in the upper part of my stomach the whole time.\n\nIn the following week, I also started experiencing mouth nausea and a feeling of vomiting, despite I never vomited. I woke up in the morning already feeling nauseous and had to rush to the toilet, just like before, with watery stools. I must mention that during the time these problems started, I had, and still have, psychological issues (depression, due to other matters), and at that time, I was taking a combination of antidepressants, which I changed in various ways after consulting with a psychiatrist, so I initially attributed it to that. Continuing on... In December, I underwent routine examinations with my doctor, such as blood tests and stool tests, and then I had an ultrasound, but everything was fine. However, the symptoms persisted into the new year; it was terrible, with constant nausea, a persistent feeling of vomiting in my mouth, and pain in the upper abdomen. Eventually, I went to see a gastroenterologist, where in January, they conducted all possible tests and examinations, including gastroscopy and colonoscopy, but everything came back without the slightest finding or problem.  \n\n\nOne note, the gastroscopy was incredibly difficult for me, as I constantly felt nauseous in my mouth (sensing it somewhere behind my tongue, at the beginning of my throat). I had an intense urge to vomit, and after the gastroscopy, I struggled for several weeks with significant stomach pain and diarrhea, similar to the beginning. The nausea was immense, just dreadful. A week later, I had a colonoscopy, and despite a one-day cleansing with laxatives and the like, my intestines were completely contaminated with watery stool (I saw it on the camera).\n\nTo summarize the gastrological aspect, all my results were normal, and the doctor didn't know what was wrong with me, so he prescribed some pills containing mix of: Calcium carb, Codein, Papavereni, Sacharin Albi, Miscle fiat pulvis. I took them in the morning and evening, and although they made my stool firmer, it still looked bad (yellowish color) and had a strange smell. Moreover, they caused increased nausea in my mouth. In the meantime, in April, when I had had enough of everything, I decided, with the doctor's agreement, to stop taking all antidepressants completely and cleanse my body. I felt slightly better, but it probably wasn't the cause. I was frustrated, so I made an appointment with an infectious disease specialist, and I got tested for all possible viruses, sexually transmitted diseases, and even things like HIV, hepatitis, and so on, but everything came back negative.\n\nI forgot to mention, at the end of January, I noticed (until then, I had never looked at it) that I had a terribly thick, white coating on my tongue, and it has been there for six months now. I thought it could be candidiasis, as I had previously been diagnosed with it from swabs on my penis, but this time I had swabs taken from my throat and tongue, and the finding was negative. I also read that e-coli bacteria can cause watery diarrhea, but I don't believe they would miss detecting it in my tests.\r  \n\r  \nBasically, I'm currently lost and desperate. It's not as bad as it was at the beginning, but I constantly feel either nauseous, have loose stools, or experience pain in the upper part of my stomach. It seems to me that everything I eat is processed in my stomach instantly and moves on. It's like an extremely accelerated metabolism, and I never feel emptied.  \n\r  \nThe stool is colored yellow and has an unnatural smell. No complications with the gallbladder or pancreas were found. Recently, I was examined for immunology, and milk intolerance was detected, but I don't think it had an impact on this issue. Additionally, some weakened immune cells were identified, and I have started taking Imunor. For the past few months, I have been regularly consuming probiotics and various combinations of vitamins, without success. I tried changing my diet, but it doesn't seem to have any effect. Simply put, since the end of November, something has completely changed in my digestion; my stomach feels heavy within half an hour after eating, and so on.\n\nIf you have any further questions or if there's anything else you're interested in, I'll respond to everything in the comments.\r  \n\n\nThank you for reading..\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\n\n&#x200B;",

I am reaching out to the community for some information and guidance regarding the physical symptoms I have been experiencing, which have been progressively impacting my life for the worse. I've tried to keep these symptoms hidden for some time, but recently they have become unbearable, leading to extreme health issues.\n\nI have been dealing with anxiety for nearly a decade. In the early years, I considered it a normal sensation that would pass after a few seconds. However, as time went on, the duration and intensity of my anxiety increased significantly. It became associated with certain physical attributes, such as heights or open spaces, leading me to avoid such situations. Over the years, my brain has linked anxiety to many variables, causing me to restrict various activities to avoid triggering anxiety symptoms.\n\nCurrently, my anxiety has reached a state where I constantly feel pressure on my chest, as if something heavy is building up. This sensation is persistent, lasting 24 hours a day. When I encounter a situation tied to my anxiety triggers, my heart rate increases, and I experience vertigo, numbness in my legs, and bowel issues. Occasionally, I even feel skipped heartbeats.\n\nMy goal is to regain a sense of normalcy, just like I felt 10 years ago. I miss the days when I didn't feel constant chest pressure or my heart racing due to unknown thoughts. I want to travel, enjoy life, and participate in activities like any other person, free from panic episodes. I have tried taking supplements like vitamin D3, folic acid, B12, and iron, but unfortunately, they haven't provided any relief. As a coping mechanism, I find that online games help calm my symptoms, but I spend a significant amount of time engaged in this activity.\n\nI am now seeking advice on how to reach out to a nearby doctor or healthcare professional who can help me with my symptoms. I'm unsure if there is a possible treatment for my condition, but I refuse to believe that I have to continue living like this without any hope for improvement.\n\nIf anyone has had a similar experience or has insights into possible remedies or treatment options, I would greatly appreciate your advice. Additionally, if you could provide guidance on how to effectively communicate my symptoms to a healthcare professional, it would be incredibly helpful.\n\nThank you all for your time and support. I look forward to hearing from you and hopefully finding a path towards relief and recovery.",

I\u2019ve worn a mask when possible but it\u2019s a crappy medical mask, not and industrial one.\n\n16th - earliest that the gunky mucus and headaches could have started, but might have been the 17th\n\n18th - full swing head cold. Producing loads of green gunk. Full on social distancing and washing hands like it\u2019s covid.\n\n21st- gunk starts to subside, throat becomes really painful and raspy\n\n22nd - covid test : negative. Throat now worse. Since then the gunk has almost disappeared, is only slightly green and mostly just watery.\n\nPresently: still raspy as hell, can\u2019t hit the high notes my dog has learnt means dinner time / time to come in , so he just continues to run around the garden til he\u2019s bored haha\n\nPharmacist suggested that the cold might have been protecting my throat and now it\u2019s gone / going so hence the bad throat from dust.\n\nSituation is I need a decision by this evening and in a strange way it\u2019s a case of damned either way because my housemate has a week immunity system but the friend I made plans with is 74 and sings in a choir so doesn\u2019t want his voice ruining\n\nWhat to do? Am I infectious ?",

        "context": "I'm gasping for 2 weeks now\n23yo m,5'10,75 kg.Smoking less than 5 cigarettes a day.I was really excited to see my friends for the first time after 5 years. I went to the airport,entered the plane. When the pilot announced takeoff, I suddenly couldn't breathe properly. I had travelled with plane 7-8 times, so this was a first to me. I lost control of myself and told the hostess that I wanted to get off the plane immediately. They first asked if there was a doctor among the passengers, luckily, there was one, unlucky for me, she couldn't help me. I grabbed my luggage and rushed outside the airport, but i was still gasping. Went to the train, still gasping. I was gasping the whole 1 hour ride. I didn't want to go home, asked my friend if I could stay over, she agreed. I was still gasping and at that point, it was fucking annoying. I stayed there for 3 days, had a panic attack on the second day of my visit, felt fucking ashamed that I was weak and troubled my friend. I left after that day, took a bus, still gasping. I was about to collapse on my way to home, but I told myself that if I make it to the house,it'll be okay. It wasn't okay at all. I realized that I can't even go outside anymore. I've been staying at home for 2 weeks now,and it feels fucking awful,like a new kind of low. I booked an appointment to the doctor, but any doctor in my country takes too long to get a in appointment, so the earliest I can go is August 10th. I can't afford going to a private hospital too,so the best I can do is ask here.Why does this happen?\n\nEDIT:Thanks for all the responses.I'll be going to the private hospital this wednesday.I'll be selling my guitar for the fees,but at this point I don't care as long as I can breathe normally again.I will keep you guys updated on wednesday.\n\nEDIT 2:For those who are telling me to immediately go to the hospital,if I could,I would.The nearest public hospital is a fucking joke,even the patients who's lying on the floor half-dead are ignored by the \"doctors\".Even if you get in,it's a merely 1 minute examine,since there's always a 1000 people in line.The private hospital costs around a minimum wage,which I don't have any at the moment.So in order to go,I have to wait for the buyer to buy my guitar at wednesday.Turkey is in a crisis right now,so you can't \"immediately\" go to a hospital unless you are way well off.Sorry for the blast off,it's only meant for the higher ups in this shithole.",
