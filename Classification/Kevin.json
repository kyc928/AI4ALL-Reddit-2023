The amount of blood so far has been equal to like a light to medium period but I just finished my period and am on birth control. Google says I could have a bruised cervix but I just want to know how much bleeding is normal/is it normal to continue bleeding hours after having sex?

I'm not sure whether this is related to my tension headaches, but the ear fullness I feel when doing this is the same as the symptom I outline.\n\n**Important Notes**\n\n1. I have very little stress. I really manage stress well. Beyond stress *caused by* this, it's not stress. I am retired. I have a great life. I meditate and exercise. No mental health issues. \n\n**My theories**\n\n1. TMJ\n   1. I don't *currently* clench my teeth while sleeping or awake. However, this did begin 3 months after a stressful period where I was clenching a lot. I wonder if this messed up a disc.\n      1. My bite jerks to one side at a certain point during mouth opening, which it didn't used to. **However, a TMJ specialist (regarded as one of the best in NYC and referred to me by my orthodontist, who thought my disc could be messed up) believed that this could not be caused by my disc.** \n      2. I do not have pain or visible TMJ issues on CT scan, so according to specialist, this is unlikely.\n2. UARS/OSA \n   1. I'm getting a CPAP machine to try because I'm desperate. But I don't think that it will help me very much. I don't really suffer from any fatigue. But who knows.\n   2. This was put forth as the main theory by the TMJ specialist after seeing my sleep study\n\n**My questions**\n\n1. Could I have a disc issue based on the above? I don't have pain in either TMJ at all, and the CT was normal, but I'm not sure this jerking motion is as \"normal\" as it was made out to be by the specialist. **Should I push for an MRI of that disc?**\n2. If this is related to UARS/OSA, **does that explain the chronic ear fullness?** This is a very distinct symptom that started exactly at the same time\n3. What else am I not thinking of? Is it really true that these headaches can just randomly appear and my best hope is trying random stuff?",

The same day, I went to urgent care where X-rays were taken, but no broken bones were found. It was concluded that it was just a sprain, although I was told to see an orthopedic doctor if the pain wasn't getting better after a week, as the x-ray could have missed a hairline fracture. I was given an air cast and sent home to do ice/elevation. My ankle was very swollen, but I was able to walk just fine and there was not any bruising. What concerns me though is the noise I heard when the injury happened. Upon falling, I both felt and heard a pop in my ankle which makes me wonder if I tore a ligament.\n\nNow, 6 days later, the swelling is still there but to a much lesser degree. The pain was gradually improving the following 2 days after the sprain but has remained the same after that point. In fact, it almost seems slightly more painful today and yesterday. My ankle also seems...loose? Not sure if that makes any sense, but it just doesn't feel right. It sounds gross, but it feels like my foot is ready to fall off of my leg or something lol. Just a very unstable feeling. \n\nA little over a year ago, I had a very similar injury. I stupidly did not rest properly though, and only went to the doctor after 2 months of my ankle still hurting. She sent me to physical therapy which I attended for another two months. I was then referred to an orthopedic doctor who did an MRI and found bone bruising, a grade 2 sprain, and a small fracture which I had been walking around on for almost 4 months at that point. It was the same ankle in both sprains, likely due to the instability created by the first injury.\n\nI want to be more proactive this time around, but I also don't want to unnecessarily see a doctor if the sprain is minor. At what point should I make an appointment with an orthopedic doctor?",

Turns out that all of my issues I had during pregnancy, the cause of my son\u2019s stillbirth, and my chest pain and dizziness were all a result of Rheumatic Heart Disease.\n\nI ended up having a stroke and I thought that would change my urgency of care, but still I was dismissed by all of my providers. My cardiologist was very condescending and said my issues, specifically worsening issues, such as extreme chest pain, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, feeling a cold fluid feeling in my chest, my swollen abdomen and feet, and a hard cough, were just the result of stress and anxiety. I asked for an updated echocardiogram since I had one last year and much has change with my symptoms. I was denied and said an echo was absolutely not needed in my case. \n\nI went to my primary care who was also condescending and said it was anxiety. At the point of anger and tears I told her I felt like I\u2019m dying and I needed help. She said she was not a cardiologist but if it would help me feel better she would order an echocardiogram at the local hospital. \n\nMonday I had the echo. Wednesday I was diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease affecting both the mitral and tricuspid valves. There is still no urgency from my care team. I\u2019m being ignored by my PCP. My cardiologist gave a half-hearted \u201cwe\u2019ll request the echo records\u201d when I called them. I feel even worse. My chest pain now only ends when I feel a burst of fluid that feels like it fills my chest and neck. I\u2019m having trouble breathing all the time. But if I have a feeling if I traveled to the ER again, I\u2019d be dismissed right away just like I was before in pregnancy and earlier postpartum. I\u2019ve had this chest pain for months and especially when I was pregnant but for all the 6 times I went to Labor and Delivery I was discharged right away and never given an EKG or any cardiac work up. Same with my OB. \n\nSeparately, I\u2019m seeing a neurologist for my TIA. He\u2019s found something doing an EEG and multiple MRIs. He won\u2019t tell me the results until my follow up on 2 weeks but told me I absolutely cannot work or drive. \n\nI\u2019m truly at a loss of what to do. If I call the office I get attitude from both the nurses and receptionists. I can\u2019t even find good information on this disease because it seems like it\u2019s not common in developed countries. I live in the US, I\u2019m upper-middle class, I have always taken my full course of antibiotics when I\u2019ve had strep. I just don\u2019t understand how of the thousands and thousands of dollars I\u2019ve spent trying to get help over the past few months all I have to show for it is a permanent heart condition, a dead child, and no plan moving forward.",

        "context": "Sinus pressure on palate after jaw surgery\nHi all,\n\nI am currently 32, male.  I am obese and take medications for blood pressure and anxiety.  I was born with an underbite and crossbite and so at approx. age 25 I started a two part orthognathic surgical process to correct this.  The first surgery, a SARPE (surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion) was uneventful, but the bone-borne palatal expander that was implanted in the roof of my mouth fractured a week after surgery (while being activated via the wrench provided) and was prematurely removed, while the doctors maintained the transverse width that I had achieved to that point and move forward with orthodontics in preparation for the second surgery.  The second surgery, a Le Fort I osteotomy, advanced the maxilla forward.  I then had several additional months of orthodontics.\n\nAfter the braces were removed it was clear that my crossbite remained, likely as a result of inadequate expansion of the maxilla because of the palatal expander failure.  I was recommended for a revision surgery which I had done in 2019.  The new surgeon removed the hardware (plates and screws) from the Le Fort I osteotomy and repeated the SARPE procedure from scratch.  \n\nAfter this repeat SARPE surgery, the upper right quadrant of teeth either shifted downward entirely or the teeth erupted downward and I suffered root resorption and gum recession on almost all right side maxillary as a result.  I also developed a burning sensation in the right side of the hard palate, and a sensation of fullness/inflation when I breathe through my nose.  If I perform a Valsalva maneuver and breathe into my nose I feel air pressure on almost all teeth on the right side of the maxilla (and not the left), and it feels as if something is \"inflating\" between my right-side hard palate/teeth and the floor of my right nostril.  Additionally, if I shift my mandible left to right it activates a sort of suction/popping that is both clearly audible but also felt in those same areas of the palate/nasal floor.  I do not believe this popping is coming from the jaw joints (TMJ).\n\nA recent CT scan at my periodontist showed fluid in the right maxillary sinus, but other than that my jaw surgeon (who did the revision) has offered no explanation, and neither has any orthodontist or the periodontist himself.  The periodontist has recommended seeing an ENT which I am doing next month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestions: \n\n1. Why did the right side of my maxilla/those teeth shift downward after the revision SARPE procedure?\n2. Why did the gums recede on those teeth at the same time as the downward shift?\n3. What is going on with the air pressure/popping/clicking in the palate/nasal floor?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy jaw surgeon has shrugged off my complaints and it has made me feel powerless over my own health.

        "context": "ENT/Neurology: What tests do I need and how urgently should I be getting more care? (Carotid/brain/ear vascular issues)\n**About Me:** 39F, 5'7\" 122lbs, white\n\n**Medical Diagnoses:** Costochondritis (mild, comes and goes), major depression, OCD\n\n**Current Medications:** Prozac 20mg (started only a month ago), Xanax 0.5mg as needed\n\n**Current Supplements:** Vitamin D, Vitamin C, fish oil, CoQ10, Lipo Flavanoids (started a few days ago just to see if they help)\n\n**Lifestyle:** Never smoked, drink on occasion (only drink one when I do), active/exercise regularly\n\n**Primary Complaint:** Constant 24/7 high-pitched hissing tinnitus that is sometimes pulsatile. The constant tinnitus is in both ears, though the left ear is often louder and sometimes has an additional tone.\n\n**Details about the pulsatile tinnitus:** The tinnitus is usually constant, but becomes pulsatile when I:\n\n* **Bend over** \\- I'll get about 5 seconds of pulse-synchronous whooshing in both ears. It's not a low-pitched ultrasound noise, it's like my hissing tinnitus pulsing along to my heart (ssssSSSSsssSSSssSSSsssSSS)\n* **Stand up quickly** \\- Again, about 5 seconds of pulse-synchronous whooshing in both ears\n* **Turn my head all the way to the right** \\- Same, about 5 seconds of the whooshing\n\nIf I maintain the positions above, after the 5-ish seconds, the pulsing stops and the tinnitus hisses normally, non-pulsatile.\n\nOther times it is pulsatile is doing hard cardio **exercise**... this is when it pulses the most, I hear 3-5 seconds of whooshing (both ears) on every other exhale when my heart rate is raised and pumping hard. Otherwise, I feel GREAT when I exercise, my heart rate recovers quickly when I stop, no headaches or weakness, etc.\n\nSometimes, I hear the pulsing inside my tinnitus when I first wake up in the morning, or when I wake up from a vivid dream. This can sometimes take a little while to calm down and is sometimes louder in the left ear.\n\nThe constant tinnitus is extremely somatic. I can make it louder by turning my head to the right, bending my neck all the way back, pushing on my forehead, jutting my jaw out, etc. I can even 'fake' the exact sound it makes when it's actually pulse-synchronous by doing these movements... the sound is the same.\n\n**The weirdest thing:** during the times the tinnitus is pulsing, I can STOP the pulsing by closing my teeth together. I CANNOT stop the pulsing by pressing anywhere on my neck or throat (I know that's a common test for vascular PT) I also cannot make a recording of the pulsing, which tells me it is probably a subjective noise and not 'real'.\n\n**Duration of Complaint:** 2-3 years, I don't know exactly, but it's been going on for quite a long time.\n\n**Factors to Consider:** I have a history of going to air shows and concerts without ear protection. I also used to work wedding receptions. For the last several years I have been using AirPods on my 6-7 mile daily walks, and I definitely had the music up way too loud to hear over traffic/outside noise. I know this is why I have the constant tinnitus. What I don't understand is why it is sometimes pulsatile. I protect my hearing now.\n\n**Tests I have had:**\n\n* **Brain MRI, with and without contrast, with IAC protocol:** totally clear and 'normal'\n* **Blood tests:** not anemic, liver and kidney function fine, thyroid levels are normal. Vitamin levels were not tested.\n* **Blood Pressure:** runs low if anything, has never been elevated when measured\n* **Hearing Test:** All thresholds normal, symmetrical hearing, including some extended high frequencies tested\n* **LDL/Tympanometry:** Normal LDLs and normal pressures\n* **Vestibular tests:** found a slight unilateral hypofunction on the RIGHT side, which is my 'better' tinnitus ear.. test was done to diagnose 24/7 rocking dizziness for a few months post-COVID infection. I've since 'compensated' for this and no longer feel dizzy.\n* **Chest CTA/EKG/Echocardiogram:** These were done last month because of a bad septic pneumonia infection, not because of the pulsatile tinnitus, but everything was perfect so I'm including it here just to mention that there probably isn't a cardiac concern.\n* **Eye Exam:** included digital images of my optic nerves, no papilledema seen\n\nI never cared about the noise before until I started being anxious about it, but now it causes me a great deal of anxiety and I listen to it constantly. I feel like I can habituate to it again if I could remove the anxiety that something is really wrong, since Googling 'pulsatile tinnitus' leads you down some scary rabbit holes, which is why I started seeking a doctor to begin with.\n\nI've been seeing an ENT/Neurotologist specialist, who I thought would be the best person for this due to his hyper-specialty but he seems unconcerned about my specific symptoms? I had to push for even the standard contrast brain MRI. He thinks if my PT was anything super concerning it would only ever appear in one ear and would be a more constant 24/7 thing.\n\nI think all of you doctors on here are so generous with your time and expertise, and I'm hoping you can give me some basic advice... **with my specific symptoms should I just put this to rest, or should I be seeking more scans ( brain MRA or carotid ultrasound?) And how urgently should I be seeking this out?**\n\nI'm not really trying to hunt down a cause for the PT, but I DO want to make sure that there's nothing dangerous going on.\n\nI'm really, really struggling with the anxiety. It's led me to restart Prozac after saying, years ago, that I'd never go back on another SSRI.\n\n(edited to include eye exam info, fixed typos)",

I finally got the GI doc to give me a colonoscopy which came back normal, so he told me to just continue with the fiber and laxatives which were already not helping, so I basically just gave up on getting professional help for a while.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m now almost 35 and trying to take my health more seriously, and as a registered nurse I know that what I\u2019m experiencing is not normal and needs further evaluation. I go on bouts (I know I should be more consistent but struggle due to the untreated ADHD, also on the waitlist for a behavioral health provider) of taking fiber, magnesium citrate, and pre-/pro-biotics which are helping some, and I\u2019m basically to the point where I can sometimes initiate a BM naturally (especially if I wait longer than usual/comfortable once I\u2019ve had the sensation that I need to go) but still not go completely without digital stool removal or using an enema for the rest.\r  \n\r  \nOther relevant information:\r  \n\\-My stool is usually medium-brown in color, soft-formed or mushy, rarely hard/pebbly, I often express clear mucus from my rectum with or without stool, occasionally thick whitish stringy material in stool itself, and I\u2019ve noticed that some of the time when I have a BM without assistance it is very narrow (around finger-width) and sort of flat as if my internal anal sphincter doesn\u2019t like to fully/easily open (often feels like this when I insert fingers as well).\r  \n\\-I often have BLQ abdominal tenderness to palpation.\r  \n\\-I do get rare shooting pain from my anus to my penis; only happened a handful of times or so and seems random/unrelated to bowel movements or assisted stool removal.\r  \n\\-I have a small nodule (maybe pen-tip size if that) in my posterior rectum about 1 inch in (appeared \\~1.5 years ago, is small, soft, and has not grown in size; assessed by a family practice doc who gave me a referral to infectious disease despite all my STI tests coming back negative, that office said I should get a referral to a colo-rectal specialist, so I told the ordering doc and he just never got back to me). I assume it\u2019s from all the mild trauma initiated by digital insertion, enemas, and occasional anal sexual activity (see below) but don\u2019t know for sure.\r  \n\\-I do \u201cbottom\u201d and use anal sex toys a few times a year and have done so since my early teens, but I frequently avoid such activities due to my GI issues.\r  \n\r  \nSorry for the long-winded post, but I have a physical w/ my PCP next month and hope to have some suggestions of what to explore/tell her and maybe some advice of what I can do on my own to help.

The dentist ruled out a dental cause and suggested seeing an ENT.\n\nI had a scan done and the ENT said there was \u2018white\u2019 on the region of the scan and he didn\u2019t know what it was. So he referred me to another ENT department he thought could help.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t access his scan and to my recollection they ordered another one. They told me that they found an osteoma at the exact location of my pain, however they don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for an osteoma to cause facial pain. So they referred me to a pain clinic who said it was \u2018idiopathic facial pain\u2019 and probably neurological in origin. They said my best bet was seeing a \u2018pain psychologist\u2019 and taking nerve pain medication (which hasn\u2019t helped at all).\n\nI felt I wanted a second opinion on the osteoma and the pain, and finally got seen again by the ENT. They stated they couldn\u2019t access either of my scans, and had no record of the second scan and that it probably \u2018didn\u2019t happen\u2019 (it did). Nonetheless, he still was adamant that the osteoma couldn\u2019t cause facial pain and that pain psychology was the only treatment.\n\nNow, every study I have read states that sinus osteomas can and often do cause facial pain.\n\n\u2018The most common symptom of paranasal osteomas is pain including headache and facial pain (Atallah and Jay, 1981).\u2019 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319453411001044#:~:text=The%20clinical%20presentation%20of%20paranasal,Atallah%20and%20Jay%2C%201981).\n\nIt seems bizarre to me that there would be an osteoma at the exact location of the pain that\u2019s unrelated. What\u2019s even more bizarre to me is being told it can\u2019t cause facial pain when every study says it does.\n\nNow I\u2019m not certain this is the cause of the pain. However it confused me. Furthermore, I am not happy with the idiopathic/nerve diagnosis. They arrived at that from simply not finding another cause, and it really doesn\u2019t feel like a nerve problem to me (it feels very structural/physical, largely affected by pressure, I can feel/hear liquid/fluid opening closing etc).\n\nThey have stated they are going to try and locate the past scan, however that was from 4 years ago. I will pursue a new scan, but i am not convinced of whether the response will be any better.\n\nAny thoughts or advice would be useful!\n\nThanks",

I try to keep good gut health drinking kombucha for the probiotics and all that stuff.\n\nRecently in the last few weeks I've been concentrating on eating more fiber to bulk up my poops a little bit more as I felt they were a touch loose.  I may have over did it as this may have caused my constipation as I was not drinking enough liquids to offset the increase in fiber.\n\nA side effect of this constipation seems to be the need to pee often, though when I pee not a lot comes out.  This usually happens at night after dinner and gets worst while I'm trying to sleep.  It's to the point that I'm try to pee, I feel like I'm done, go back to bed and 5 minutes later I have the I need to pee feeling again.\n\nSo I was talking with a friend yesterday about my constipation and they said a salt cleanse helped them in the past to get things moving.  So I read up on that yesterday and it seemed simple enough to try.  I did it first thing this morning and boy did lots of poop and sludge come out.\n\nI probably pooped water on and off for 30 minutes. At the end the water was pretty clear so I felt like it did it's job.  I did instantly feel better the rest of the morning.  I ate a egg and avocado sandwich for lunch, 5 hours after pooping water, to keep things light and have drank lots of water and a Kombucha today to rehydrate for all that lost water.\n\nOne thing in particular is the need to pee often with not much coming out has not gone away. I have had that pretty much all afternoon and still have it now as I type this post.  I'm been doing some Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles the last hour and that seem to have help things a bit.\n\nI still feel like I have to pee, but it's more an annoying feeling of something in the chamber then I have to pee right now.  I'm not sure if this matter, but it's a data point.\n\nSo now one thing I did Tuesday night, that may be important, was have some bedroom fun with my girlfriend.  So now I enjoy edging and she loves taking the dominate role at times.  So on this night we went at it where she basically controlled when and how I would cum.\n\nWe got to a point where I was rock hard riding the edge as she was stroking me.  At one point I felt the urge to pee and I said I have to pee.  She played her dominate role and say no peeing.\n\nHonestly I kind of liked it. The urge to pee while riding the edge, felt great.  So I went with it and didn't use our safe word to stop.\n\nIf anything I felt even harder having to pee and riding the edge.  My girlfriend was loving it, even commenting how much harder I was than normal.  This lasted for at least 45 minutes before I ejaculated and my penis had this vibrating feeling that was out of this world.\n\nAt that point I still had to great urge to pee but I was rock hard from all of the stimulation.  This made peeing pretty difficult, but I pushed it out.  I will say pushing out the pee was not smooth in the sense that t was kind of stop and start peeing.   In hindsight this may have not been the best move.\n\nThough I noticed \\~15 minutes later when I was completely soft that I felt like I had to pee again.  I went and only a dribble came out.\n\nI tell you all this because that urge to pee feeling I get now, feels pretty much the same as that urge to pee after 15 minutes I just mentioned.  If I do pee more the a dribble then it's has this stop and stop feel to it as well when I try to relax the muscle holding the pee back.  I don't know if they are related or just coincidence, but I felt it was worth a note.\n\nAnyways if anybody has some advice fore getting through the weekend that would be great.  I have no idea what tomorrow will bring and if all my issues will just go away with a night of sleet, but I'm looking for an opinion / some advice.\n\nMy doctor's office did not think this was an emergency, so I should not have much to worry about, but this urge to pee is pretty annoying.   It's been a little over an hour since I last peed as the Kegel exercises I talked about above seem to setting things down.  It's more of a tingle now then an all out I have to pee.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions and I apologize for any bad grammar or spelling.  Thanks for any help.\n\n&#x200B;",

[26M]\n**Me**\n\n26 M white male, no other health issues, nonsmoker, nondrinker\n\n**Symptoms**  \n1. Constant tension headaches for 8 months which feel like pressure around my ears, my forehead, and my temple region. Little if any pain, but lots of tightness that is severely uncomfortable.\n\n2. Ear fullness that I can \"pop\" away but consistently returns  \n**What I've tried**\n\nIt's unclear what the cause is, which is infuriating. Here are the things that I've tried.\n\n1. Prednisone \u2014 Helped a lot, but told I can't stay on it\n2. Botox - Also very helpful, but of course is a \"bandaid\"\n3. Flexeril \u2014 Did nothing\n4. 3 migraine medicines \u2014 Did nothing\n5. Physical therapy / stretching \u2014 Did nothing\n6. Custom orthotic splint (Glidewell Clearsplint) \u2014 Did nothing\n\n**Scans and bloodwork**\n\n1. Brain MRI \u2014 Normal\n2. Cervical Spine MRI \u2014 Normal\n3. CT Scan of TMJ joints \u2014 Normal\n4. Sleep Test: AHI of 5.6, RDI of 20.0 (mild-moderate sleep apnea)\n   1. I'm quite skinny and I sleep on my stomach, so maybe more likely UARS?\n\n**What makes it worse**\n\n1. When I bite together, I feel a muscle around my ears being triggered and they instantly get more \"full\". I'm not sure whether this is related to my tension headaches, but the ear fullness I feel when doing this is the same as the symptom I outline.\n\n**Important Notes**\n\n1. I have very little stress. I really manage stress well. Beyond stress *caused by* this, it's not stress. I am retired. I have a great life. I meditate and exercise. No mental health issues. \n\n**My theories**\n\n1. TMJ\n   1. I don't *currently* clench my teeth while sleeping or awake. However, this did begin 3 months after a stressful period where I was clenching a lot. I wonder if this messed up a disc.\n      1. My bite jerks to one side at a certain point during mouth opening, which it didn't used to. **However, a TMJ specialist (regarded as one of the best in NYC and referred to me by my orthodontist, who thought my disc could be messed up) believed that this could not be caused by my disc.** \n      2. I do not have pain or visible TMJ issues on CT scan, so according to specialist, this is unlikely.\n2. UARS/OSA \n   1. I'm getting a CPAP machine to try because I'm desperate. But I don't think that it will help me very much. I don't really suffer from any fatigue. But who knows.\n   2. This was put forth as the main theory by the TMJ specialist after seeing my sleep study\n\n**My questions**\n\n1. Could I have a disc issue based on the above? I don't have pain in either TMJ at all, and the CT was normal, but I'm not sure this jerking motion is as \"normal\" as it was made out to be by the specialist. **Should I push for an MRI of that disc?**\n2. If this is related to UARS/OSA, **does that explain the chronic ear fullness?** This is a very distinct symptom that started exactly at the same time\n3. What else am I not thinking of? Is it really true that these headaches can just randomly appear and my best hope is trying random stuff?",

Go to the gym 5-6 times a week, diet well, stay clean (shower daily, wash face twice daily etc), I walk a lot cause I live in a walkable town and have a big dog so I\u2019m usually hitting 10k plus steps. Still play sports casually but used to be competitive until like 3 years ago.\n\nI do drink probably 2-3 times a week and smoke weed and vape. Occasionally I use mdma and lsd like maybe 2-3 times a year. I also used to be addicted to pills but now I\u2019m almost 3 years clean. My issues don\u2019t poke around using drugs and were actually less prevelant when I was addicted to drugs but I think that\u2019s just due to less anxiety and obviously not a worthy trade off\n\n\nSo basically about 5-6 years ago is started where my face, specifically my eyes and lips would swell up. Similar to a black eye or busted lip without the black or busted part. I would also get hives on my body that would potentially get huge and come and go seemingly randomly. Went to multiple different doctors including primary care, allergist, dermatologist, and then another allergist before I was finally diagnosed with chronic idiopathic uriticaria and angiodema. It\u2019s low key a fake diagnosis where chronic means it is recurring, idiopathic means they don\u2019t know what causes it, angiodema and urticaria means hives and swelling so basically just the scientific term for exactly what I know before going in.\n\nI have tried everything from food diaries, tracking daily activities such as drinking and excersize and locations I went to. I even spent a week eating plain rice and chicken with just salt and pepper only and not drinking anything aside from water.\n\nNow something a little different. Like 8-10 years ago I got scuba diving certified. On my first dive even tho I pressurized properly, it felt like the area under my eye next to my nose was about to explode. Quickly finished the test and went back up safely. I\u2019ve always been a really good swimmer getting top positions in state and such. After this when I dive down even 10 feet it starts to hurt if I don\u2019t pressurize. They guessed I had an air pocket in my sinus that didn\u2019t allow it to pressurize properly.\n\nYesterday I was somewhere cool in the ocean and was diving down about 10-15 feet probably about 10 total times and pressurized on the way down and up every time. Occasionally felt it a little but overall didn\u2019t hurt too bad. Now today I wake up and my face is a little swollen\u2019 lt is swollen below my eye across from my nose similar to where it hurts and not where it normally swells. This is only the second time it has swollen here and I don\u2019t really remember if anything caused it the first time\n\nWhat I\u2019m wondering is could these possibly be related? Do you guys know anything else about this condition or how to stop it? I want to stop taking Zyrtec every day but when I did stop for like a month my hives and swelling started flaring up. Is there anything I can do? When I\u2019ve looked at the potential causes/triggers it says shit like being hot being cold too much excersize not enough excersize etc",

Then, I bought some salicylic acid pads from CVS and started applying them, switching them out every couple of days like the packing said. The little stickers were hard to get off, so today, after I showered, I decided it would be a great time to try to take it off and replace it. Except, it ripped a hole in my foot and there\u2019s a little white spot in the middle. Mind you, I\u2019ve only had these little pads on for like\u2026a week maybe two weeks max. \n\nLooking back in hindsight, water makes skin soft and salicylic acid kills skin, so of course this chain of events makes sense. But I don\u2019t know how to treat it now, and I really cannot handle if I end up having like six warts all over my foot. \n\nI tried googling this first, and of course, it told me my life will be forever filled with warts and I\u2019m stupid, so I\u2019m hoping this sub will be more helpful.",

Around two months ago I started experiencing chest pain it started off low and increased in severity. After one day when I got angry I felt the pain radiate through my left arm all the way to my heart. I went to the ER and the ecg was normal but the attending physician heard my heart through a stethoscope and recommended seeing a cardiologist. \n\nAfter multiple tests with the cardiologist he said I had mild moderate mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation. However, he insisted that it has nothing to do with the chest pain and it is caused by stress and anxiety. He basically told me to go and speak to a psychiatrist. This was end of May, the pain has not gone away at all. I went to another cardiologist that said the same thing. I spoke to a third cardiologist and he said to take it easy and not move much but thats about it. The problem is that this pain is becoming debilitating and because it hurts I cannot stop thinking about it. \n\nThe pain can be described as a pressure in the heart or stabbing, my arm sometimes feels numb or sore. It is sometimes accompanied by nausea and lightheadedness as well as fatigue. All depends on the day somedays it can be bearable others not really. \n\nAny help about this is appreciated.  thank you",

        "context": "Periodic inguinal lymph node swelling during pregnancy\nI\u2019m a 32F, generally very healthy, currently am 11 weeks 5 days pregnant with my first child.\n\nSo this actually started about a month before getting pregnant, so this past April. It was my first cycle off of my BC (Annovera) as we intended to start TTC for the first time the next month. I had a lot of fullness and and pain in my lower abdomen, like a combination of period pain and the type of pain from having a very full bladder, going on for about a week. I was also urinating very frequently. I was getting to the point of thinking I should make a doctors appointment (I recently moved and don\u2019t have PC doc in my area yet, which is why I didn\u2019t go sooner).  My thought was possibly I had a UTI, although it didn\u2019t particularly burn when peeing or anything like that.\n\nSo after about a week of this I was out shopping when I randomly went to rub the area that was hurting, and I felt a pretty prominent lump in my left groin area that definitely wasn\u2019t there before. Shortly after I got light headed and started to loose vision, and I had to sit down in the middle of the store (though I didn\u2019t totally loose consciousness). I believe that this was a vagal response (I\u2019ve had them before) probably to freaking myself out by feeling the lump and not passing out directly related to my condition, but obviously I can\u2019t be sure. \n\nSo I recovered from that spell and when I examined the lump some more at home, it seemed pretty obvious it was an inflamed inguinal lymph node. It was moveable and tender. The pain was pretty bad that night and the lymph node still swollen in the AM, so I went to urgent care. The doc there agreed I was feeling a lymph node and that it didn\u2019t seem particularly suspicious for anything like cancer, she examined me to look for any cuts or rashes on my body that might be causing an immune response and found nothing, so agreed it could be a UTI. She sent me home with antibiotics and sent my urine to the lab. I took the antibiotics and by the end of the course the swelling was mostly gone. The urine test came back negative, but I figured since the antibiotics helped it was likely some sort of infection somewhere causing the swelling. I also got my period a few days after the swelling started and my pain resolved after that.\n\nFast forward about a month and I got my positive pregnancy test. I had some bloating and soreness in my lower abdomen that my doc said was typical for early pregnancy, and again had urinary frequency but again, typical for pregnancy. The pain was no where near as bad as the episode a month before. A few weeks after the positive test I noticed my lymph node had swollen again. I did have some bug bites on my leg though on the same side as the lymph node so thought maybe that triggered it this time? It lasted  for a few days before the node felt normal again. The pregnancy has been normal aside for some very light spotting during the 6th week, but my blood work and US came back normal and right on track for where I am in pregnancy. \n\nHowever I am still concerned bc after the bug bites totally cleared, I noticed my lymph node still periodically became swollen and tender, with no apparent cause. It will only last for a day to a few days, then go down, sometimes going from very swollen completely normal overnight. I have noticed that taking Tylenol helps the swelling go away quickly. I mentioned this to my OB after the first time it got swollen in pregnancy, and she said she had no idea what it could be, but if it came back she could refer me to have it examined with ultrasound. But when it came back next, it was gone before I even got a chance to speak with her. The same thing happens every time, it doesn\u2019t stay swollen long enough to have it examined, but it makes me worry every time. What could this be? Could it be my body having a weird pregnancy reaction? If so, why did it first happen before pregnancy?\n\nIn terms of my medical history I had exercise-induced asthma as a kid and have OCD and anxiety (treated with Zoloft). No other chronic medical conditions. I had a CBC as well as infectious disease panel and urinalysis about three weeks ago at my OB and all was normal.",

I treated my chronic back pain mostly with chiropractor and acupuncture, guided hypnosis sleep meditation...  Anything and everything I could do to keep off meds while pregnant.  \n\nI had Gestational Hypertension which just started to turn to Preeclampsia same day they induced me at 37 weeks (had run preeclampsia test 24 hours before and was fine). After 24hrs induced and on magnesium I kept telling the nurses and Drs that magnesium was making me very sick, they kept saying it was normal and blaming preeclampsia, and it wasn't until I could barely speak and kept checking myself for stroke signs that they finally listened to me and cut the dose in half, I think it was 2mg to 1 mg but I don't know for sure, but it water being on it for 24 hours before dose was cut in half. Started feeling better but still almost paralyzed heavy and blind from magnesium.  Another 24 hrs.later they were getting ready to do a C-section cause baby was getting D cells and stopped progressing at 8cm.  They ran my blood and I was 3X the level of Magnesium toxicity (I think it was 2.5 was high and I was almost at an 8, but don't quote me, I just remember the travel nurse saying \"wow you're 3X the level of toxicity\" or something like that and she gave me numbers), even after they cut my levels in half and 24 hours later.  I ended up being manually dilated, baby was twisted wrong way so they manually twisted her and I delivered vaginally.  Immediately after birth I had a flash pulmonary adema, then had a latent post partem hemorrhage at about 13hrs PP once they got my breathing stabilized.\n\nWhat would cause me to have such bad magnesium toxicity and would magnesium toxicity cause a flash pulmonary adema?  I believe the Pitosin caused my hemorrhage, but just odd so long PP.  I had hemorrhage before but only on deliveries that were induced.\n\nI want another baby so bad.  But having that much go wrong with that delivery terrifies me.  Is there something I can do ahead of time?  What would cause me to get magnesium toxicity?  Is there other options, other things I should do that my body wasn't processing the magnesium, or was this most likely a malpractice and someone was screwing up the doses?

They said even if we did another cat scan, they still might not be able to tell because it was very mild. I was very constipated (and still am) so they recommended some stool softeners. I decided to just go home.\n\nToday, I\u2019m feeling a lot better from the kidney stone issues, but am still struggling with constipation. I am starting to have bowel movements again, luckily. I have some pain/pressure to the right of my belly button. It sorta feels like someone is just pressing their finger on my stomach constantly. I am still able to eat but have less of an appetite (but this normally happens whenever I\u2019m constipated, I just feel bloated and don\u2019t want to eat as much).

I live in Southern California, I am a 5'7\" 140lb 27 Y/O Male who is very athletic. I eat clean, I exercise regularly, and take multivitamins. \n\nI was two months into the Sheriff academy when on the weekend of June 10th 2023 I got sick. Headache, nausea, chest congestion and an overall feeling of exhaustion. I've been sick before, so this wasn't alarming. I was coughing up yellow/green phlegm that following week, and was trying to dial it down but the intensity of the sheriff academy, my pride, and pushy instructors who don't \"allow you\" to be sick got the better of me, and I trained through it. Over the next few week I felt off but generally okay, all symptoms had subsided except I was coughing up green phlegm still, and I felt like I was operating at 70% capacity. I was still running 7-9 Miles at a 7 Minute flat pace, but I felt terrible doing it. At this time I was living in barracks housing, which was old, dirty, and there was mold present in some areas. \n\nFast forward a few weeks, I choose to remove myself from the academy for a variety of reasons, my wife and daughter needed me at home, my daughter is autistic and being away for weeks at a time was too hard on her, I was still sick, and ultimately I felt the job wasn't for me. Still coughing up green phlegm on Jun 26th I went to urgent care. The Physician I saw said I probably have bronchitis and prescribed the following:\n\ndoxycycline (MONODOX) 100 MG capsule (2 a day for 10 days)\r  \nalbuterol 108 (90 Base) MCG/ACT inhaler\r  \nmethylprednisolone (MEDROL DOSEPACK) 4 MG tablet (6-5-4-3-2-1 daily doses)\n\nI took 9 days worth of the antibiotic, but it was making me feel worse, and I skipped the last dose the 10th day. I took the steroid, as directed, with the exception of one day where I missed one of the four doses. \n\nAfter all that, I developed bad sinus pressure and nasal congestion, and the chest congestion was still present. I don't have the urge to cough, but when I exhale hard and deep, or \"Huff\" I can hear the crackling and can cough up the green mucus. Usually by the afternoon I feel halfway decent and most of my congestion has eased. But the next day I start all over again; plugged nose, green mucus, chest congestion, face pressure. I live at elevation and when I drive down the hill for work I get plugged up, ear pain, and sinus pressure. OTC stuff doesn't seem to help.\n\nI went back to the same urgent care on 7/14, the PA who saw me essentially told me to continue waiting it out, was very dismissive of me, and reluctantly ordered chest and sinus X-Rays of which I am still awaiting results.\n\nUltimately, as of today I am still sick, closing in on 40 days straight of CRAP! I have never been sick for this long in my entire life. Am I overthinking it? Do I just keep waiting? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nANY ADVICE IS GREATLY APPRECIATED, and I will promptly answer any questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks\n\n&#x200B;",

I've already seen the type of doctor you are are going to suggest I swear. In fact Ive posted here a long time ago when I was having multiple types of headaches at the same time and it was basically impossible to help me because at least one was always going off and I'm terrible at figuring out what kind I'm having.\r  \n\r  \n**Progress:**\r  \nI'm happy to report quitting SSRI medications stopped the headaches SSRI sensitive people get (cyproheptadine helped but not enough and those side effects are rough).\r  \n\r  \nI have ASD and Klonopin stopped my overstimulation headaches.\r  \n\r  \nAdderall stopped my migraines.\r  \n\r  \nMeclizine is only \"helping\" my motion sickness headaches (maybe not enough) and its extremely tiring. Maybe I should go back to the Scopolamine patches 24/7.\r  \n\r  \n**Medications that did not help:**\r  \n\rPercocet\r  \n\r  \nTramadol\r  \n\r  \nFioricet\r  \n\r  \nNurtec\r  \n\r  \nQulipta\r  \n\r  \nAmlodipine\r  \n\r  \nTheophylline\r  \n\r  \nRizatriptan\r  \n\r  \nSumatriptan\r  \n\r  \nPepcid AC\r  \n\r  \nZyrtec\r  \n\r  \nMagnesium\r  \n\r  \nAdvil, Tylenol, Meloxicam, caffeine - didn't help but gave me rebound headaches\r  \n\r  \nTENS machine didn't help but maybe I should try it again. I was really trying to push it to the max I could tolerate but from what i've been reading (yea it hurts so bad I go back reading over the same old stuff hoping I find something I missed) thats really not the way to use it.\r  \n\r  \nEffexor - felt like a headache shift. If I had to guess I would say it helped my migraines but made the serotonin headaches worse (it was before adderall)\r  \n\r  \nmedial branch block c2:c3 - the procedure hurt insanely badly until the next day and they only injected a medicine that would numb occipital neuralgia for 2 hours **so I have no idea if it worked or not**. It seems like they should have anticipated I would be unable to articulate the different extreme pains so close to each other in the back of my head/neck.\r  \n\r  \n**A few more relevant notes:**\r  \n\r  \nI had a brain MRI, its fine. I had a neck MRI, they said I have some problems but they should not be bad enough to be causing any of my headaches:\r  \n\r  \nStraightening of cervical lordosis.\r  \n\r  \nMultilevel mild degenerative disc disease changes at C3-C7 with multilevel mild canal stenosis. There is no disc protrusion or cord compression.\r  \n\r  \nMild diffuse facet degenerative changes as described. I passed the caloric stimulation test but i do have tinnitus.\r  \n\r  \n**Trigger Point Injection day was frigging awesome**. For 2 hours I felt like a normal person. They said the fact that it was only 2 hours meant it failed. They said I had to be responding to the numbing medicine (Bupivacaine HCl (MARCAINE)) and not the real medicine they shot in there (triamcinolone acetonide (KENALOG-40)).\r  \n\r  \n**It looks like there are a lot of possibilities for what the remaining headache could be:**\r  \n\r  \nwhiplash damage - someone was driving a truck in the rain without windshield wipers and I was stopped at a red light. he hit me doing about 45 without trying to slow down at all because he couldnt see in the rain but that was 15 years ago and this has only been a problem for half that long\r  \n\r  \ncervicogenic headache - because its not a throbbing pain and the diagram showing pain from the top half the neck to the top of the head is perfect for me most of the time. But I went to physical therapy 8 times and a chiropractor 6 times.\r  \n\r  \nCraniocervical Instability - was suggested last time but the chiropractor would feel that right?\r  \n\r  \nchronic sub-occipital trigger point issues from bad posture - Another Aspie suggested this to me. Maybe we keep those flexed. I do lean my head forward an extreme amount. That is the area that hurts the most (when things are good and its not the whole back of my head this is actually the only area hurting).\r  \n\r  \nCFS leak - was suggested by the most people last time because of how much laying down for 30 minutes helps or how bad I feel shortly after getting out of bed in the morning. Laying down seems to help me considerably more than other people having a headache. However Theophylline didn't help so that seems to rule out CFS leak. I read CFS leaks cause \"postural headaches\" and you can can get postural headaches for other reasons than CFS leak. Perhaps I should be tested for those less common reasons.\r  \n\r  \nTension headache - But I think its tension headache even though the sides almost never hurt and I only have pain behind my forehead every once in a while. Adderall kills the migraines, makes the tension headaches worse, I take some tizanidine and the headaches go back to how they were before. Also, back before I had any issues resolved Propranolol helped me the most. And propranolol helps migraines and tension headaches. So if it was curing two different kinds of headaches that would definitely explain why it was the best (but it made me so tired I laid down more so that might be misleading me). I can't take Propranolol now. It completely nullifies the Adderall. I need a different muscle relaxer to test this further. Tizanidine ruins noradrenaline and makes me incredibly sleepy. I read there are muscle relaxers that don't change noradrenaline at all, don't significantly raise serotonin (if it raises serotonin more than Adderall's tiny bit I'd guess I can't tolerate it), and are less tiring than Tizanidine I just don't know if they are good for tension headaches.\r  \n\r  \nCould you suggest any tests or medications for me to request from my many doctors?

(May 2022.) \n\n\\* Stepped on Rusty nail in filthiest shoes possible. Photo link below.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/vjtk4e8\n\nI am a teacher and I also enjoy woodworking. I am building a 'Buddy Bench' for our elementary school playground, and we have also been DIY renovating our home this entire summer. I managed to step on an extremely rusty nail that had been outside for weeks. This happened two days ago (on Wednesday.) I was changing the bit on my trim router without gloves (brilliant, I know) and then I clipped the side of my hand and started to bleed. I leaned over to grab a paper towel, tripped, hit the side of my house, bounced off of the siding, ran into the deck railing, and then somehow flipped over my bin of scrap wood/trim and dumped it all over and then landed straight on top of a piece of shoe molding with nails sticking straight up. I jammed my foot down pretty hard/suddenly and the nail blew straight through the sole of my garden boots and punctured a little more than 1/4 inch into my foot. It was enough to cause pretty sharp pain and I did have very minor bleeding. \n\nI went straight upstairs to my bathroom and my husband, who is on peritoneal dialysis here at home, grabbed a ton of his supplies and I immediately: \n\n1.) Washed my hands, put on gloves, and then washed the puncture wound with Hibiclens for about 2-3 minutes (we used a piece of gauze for this.) I let it sit for another minute and then rinsed it off. \n\n2.) New gloves, and then I opened a pair of surgical tweezers from a package and used these to remove a chunk of the sole of my boot from the wound. \n\n3.) Washed the wound again with Hibiclens. \n\n4.) Soaked gauze in the debriding/antimicrobial liquid called 'Except' that he uses to clean his exit site for his PD catheter. I let this sit on my foot for the suggested two minutes. \n\n5.) I applied his Gentamicin ointment to my foot and then covered with a silver alginate dressing and then closed it up with one of his island bandages. I put a new, clean sock on it and then went to urgent care pronto because I believe my last Tetanus shot was in 2013...I just wasn't sure and didn't want to take any chances at all. \n\nI let the P.A at the Urgent Care have a look and he said it definitely got me, but it sounded like I did a solid job cleaning it up initially. He didn't see any more shoe bits inside and put a clean bandage on it for me and then definitely agreed that I needed a tetanus booster, so we got that done and I left. \n\nHe didn't believe I needed any preventative antibiotics at that time but did tell me that if I noticed any signs of infection, increased pain, drainage, fever, etc...to come back immediately. \n\nVaccines can obviously cause you to feel gross for a day or two, and I started feeling like absolute crap last night. Body aches, fatigue, and a very, very sore foot, calf, thigh, and hip. I figured this is from limping/overcompensating and my muscles just hurt. It hurts to ball my foot up or move it much. \n\nMy question is this: Does this sound normal for this situation and is not giving a prophylactic antibiotic the right choice for me? I think the wound looks pretty good, but I'm not a medical professional so I don't trust my own assessment LOL.  I've been keeping it super clean and covered. I'm just worried about possible infection. I don't want/mean to be paranoid, I just don't want to develop any complications. As mentioned above...my husband already has ongoing health problems. We have two young children AND I'm a new teacher that's about to start back to work in two weeks. I do NOT want or need any problems that could have been prevented.\n\nThe P.A was a great guy and I trust him for the most part, I just wanted to see what someone else has to say about it. In the grand scheme of things, this isn't a very severe nail puncture wound, but what bothers me most is the pair of boots I had on. They are absolutely filthy and I have cleaned loads of cat litter, black mold, toilets, garages, been to the landfill repeatedly, and the list goes on. The thought of a chunk of the sole of those nasty things going into my foot (along with a rusty nail) just gives me the creeps :/ \n\nAs long as the wound looks OK and I am up to date on my Tetanus shot, I should be fine to just watch and wait, right? Please ease my mind. \n\n&#x200B;",

I struggled with constipation and feeling like I was never finished when I went to the bathroom. I had mucus in stool and on the rare occasion that I would get pain from constipation lasting too long,  I would have these brief fainting spells or just feel really dizzy.\n\nMoving forward to now I've been suffering from stomach pain since the start of this year in my lower abdomen around my belly button and pelvis- mainly situated in the center and left side, constantly going back and forth between constipation and diarrhea, with nothing subsiding the pain aside from eating which slightly lessened it until I hurt even worse at night. Between the pain and the fatigue it brought with it, I've been unable to carry on with my usual activities and mostly find myself lying in pain for most of the day. I first went to my PCP who sent out abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds, as well as blood tests testing for celiac, all of which came back normal.\n\nUpon following up with my GI doctor I did a colonoscopy, in which I was unable to properly do the prep as the solution made me nauseous and so some areas were not clear. He told me however that my results were normal aside from some small hemorrhoids. I later did a H. Pylori breath test, as my dad had gotten it around this time, which came back negative. I recently did an endoscopy where a biopsy was sent which was found to be normal aside from mild gastritis, which brings me here.\n\nAside from potentially repeating the colonoscopy or doing a CT scan- which terrifies me because of the radiation- I don't know where to turn next, and hate that there almost seems to be no root cause to my symptoms.

I think it would be classified as normotrophic? The scar's not raised or textured, but noticably darker and looks similar to when I get minor wounds and after they've completely closed up, but are still visible as temporary scars (lasting maybe a few months). \n\nI have had this scar for my whole life, have never had a surgery relating to anywhere on my torso or reproductive parts, and never sustained severe injuries in this region. My bellybutton has no irregular scarring or shaping, so I don't think it's a result of umbilical cord removal.\n\nHere's where the interesting stuff comes up. I was abandoned as an infant in China during the one-child policy. I have all the reproductive parts and functions of a female (breasts, periods, reproductive parts), and I am apathetic to my own gender expression. Because of this gender apathy, one time when I mentioned the mystery scar to my friend, they sarcastically said \"maybe you were a hermaphrodite and your chinese parents cut your penis off so that you'd get adopted.\" that sounds ridiculous, and I know that intersex people don't simply have both sets of genitalia (at least not fully functioning), but honestly in my mind it's not an impossibility, and I can't help but wonder if I am actually intersex, but my bio family or whoever was there for my birth, to remove any irregular genitals so that I would have a better chance at getting adopted. \n\nThere is a rumour that floats around the Chinese-Adoption sphere that sometimes abandoned children would have a strange and unique scar so that if need be in the future, the bio parents could identify their child. I've heard a lot of mixed things about the reality of this, but it is true that when I was adopted, I had a scar on my leg that looked like a messy burn scar from a metal brand. It stayed visible on me for the first 12 years of my life before eventually fading. In China, the orphanages usually house children with disabilities or birth defects more than any other demographic because \"normal\" babies are sent out for adoption (like what happened to me).\n\nMy current family doctor's earliest records of me are from when I started the immigration process, so the first year of my life has no medical record of what could have been done. It is also possible that my actual date of birth is incorrect since the orphanage assigned a predicted date when finding me abandoned. \n\nIn blood tests, I have the following irregularities:\n\n* elevated RBC\n* below average MCV\n* elevated triglycerides\n* extremely low ferritin\n\nMy doctor has diagnosed me with thalassemia, and other than that, I have no other official diagnosis or treatments. Is it actually possible that I was born interssex? If not, what could this scar be from?",

Please give me something else. \n\nFigured I\u2019d mention that I also had an MRI done due to a high prolactin level (35) which has gone back down to 8. They wanted the MRI to check for a prolactinoma. I had a full brain scan as well as a pituitary scan and it was clean.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention. Also have been constipated for a good 3 weeks. I noticed on the 4th that I hadn\u2019t really been going much. Since then, same thing. Small amounts, always hard and unproductive. Drank 10oz of magnesium citrate two days ago, went a good amount up until like 6 last night. It lasted about 24 hours, but a vast majority of my BMs were pretty much clear. Like where is the stuff from the last 3 weeks?? Very confusing.",

My question is, how exactly does constipation happen in the bowels? If my son takes high enough doses of stool softeners and laxatives, he'll have one or two mushy poops per day. If he misses a dose or gets a smaller dose, the next day he will still poop, but it will be hard and small. The next day pebbles, and the day after that, he stops pooping altogether. When he gets back on the laxatives, he will go back and forth between pooping water and pooping pebbles until his stool gets back to normal consistency & frequency. \n\nHow could he go from soft wet poops to hard poops within a day? Wouldn't it need to be in his colon longer to get that hard? Does it mean that too much water is being pulled from his intestines? He doesn't seem dehydrated - he wets diapers well, has a wet mouth, cries tears, and drinks water all day long as well as milk bottles. He also eats lots of fiber. \n\nThank you! ",

Did I have a penis removed at birth?\nPrimary Concern: I have an unknown scar, and am paranoid if it is from a surgery shortly after my birth.\n\nAge: 18  \nSex: Female (?)  \nheight: 166cm (\\~5'6'')  \nweight: 48kg (106lbs)  \nrace: chinese\n\nI have a vertical scar that is a perfectly straight line from right below my bellybutton to my vaginal area (as far as I can tell). I think it would be classified as normotrophic? The scar's not raised or textured, but noticably darker and looks similar to when I get minor wounds and after they've completely closed up, but are still visible as temporary scars (lasting maybe a few months). \n\nI have had this scar for my whole life, have never had a surgery relating to anywhere on my torso or reproductive parts, and never sustained severe injuries in this region. My bellybutton has no irregular scarring or shaping, so I don't think it's a result of umbilical cord removal.\n\nHere's where the interesting stuff comes up. I was abandoned as an infant in China during the one-child policy. I have all the reproductive parts and functions of a female (breasts, periods, reproductive parts), and I am apathetic to my own gender expression. Because of this gender apathy, one time when I mentioned the mystery scar to my friend, they sarcastically said \"maybe you were a hermaphrodite and your chinese parents cut your penis off so that you'd get adopted.\" that sounds ridiculous, and I know that intersex people don't simply have both sets of genitalia (at least not fully functioning), but honestly in my mind it's not an impossibility, and I can't help but wonder if I am actually intersex, but my bio family or whoever was there for my birth, to remove any irregular genitals so that I would have a better chance at getting adopted. \n\nThere is a rumour that floats around the Chinese-Adoption sphere that sometimes abandoned children would have a strange and unique scar so that if need be in the future, the bio parents could identify their child. I've heard a lot of mixed things about the reality of this, but it is true that when I was adopted, I had a scar on my leg that looked like a messy burn scar from a metal brand. It stayed visible on me for the first 12 years of my life before eventually fading. In China, the orphanages usually house children with disabilities or birth defects more than any other demographic because \"normal\" babies are sent out for adoption (like what happened to me).\n\nMy current family doctor's earliest records of me are from when I started the immigration process, so the first year of my life has no medical record of what could have been done. It is also possible that my actual date of birth is incorrect since the orphanage assigned a predicted date when finding me abandoned. \n\nIn blood tests, I have the following irregularities:\n\n* elevated RBC\n* below average MCV\n* elevated triglycerides\n* extremely low ferritin\n\nMy doctor has diagnosed me with thalassemia, and other than that, I have no other official diagnosis or treatments. Is it actually possible that I was born interssex? If not, what could this scar be from?",

Looks like it's evolving to be every day now, almost like every meal...\n\n**What happened:**\n\nI just woke up a few hours earlier and went into eating my oatmeal like usual and :\n\n\\- Numbness, tingling in feet started to appear. No panic yet, I become used to it.\n\nI keep eating and :\n\n\\- I felt a very heavy weight on my mind and whole body, like something or me is going to collapse under something extremely heavy.\n\n\\- I also felt like my heart is going to stop. My body went super silent, I had a short breath and it felt hard to keep it up. It was incredibly scary, the scariest thing I've actually ever experienced for the past few years.\n\nAt this point I start to panic a bit, I called my local emergency for an opinion.\n\nI explain what's happening => Nothing alarming... \"I could send you a doc for checking your reflexes...\"\n\nI'm confused and I say I probably need a bloodwork right now and he answers with \"if the doc says so but your presence right now isn't justified at the emergency room...\". I deny sending me a doc, because I thought by the time he comes in, I'll be either dead or fine, pointless in both cases.\n\nAfter the call, things get worst, numbness goes into my face, then in my whole upper body...\n\nI could still talk (to myself) and laugh with effort, so I tell myself good, probably I won't die...\n\nThe numbness & tingling on my face felt like some kind of paralysis was taking over my body. I was 100% conscious the entire time, aside from the collapsing feeling I was 'trying' to go against.\n\nI felt like flu-like symptoms, weird muscles pains at every joint of my body and I was moving a lot like if I was trying to find a position to alleviate the pain.\n\nWhile going through that last point, I drank plenty of water.\n\nIt's been a while I had a suspicion of electrolytes imbalance, so I thought if it was hyperkalemia, water would wash the excess away,\n\nNow the numbness is almost gone, I have like 10% left in the feet, but it's still quite heavy on my whole body, not to mention the fatigue which is more extreme than usual (which is already quite bad).\n\n**IMPORTANT:**\n\nI took Bactrim 2 weeks ago for an UTI and I lost consciousness for a few seconds, I was paralyzed in my entire body. **I stopped taking it right after that.**\n\nThis was not an allergic reactions. Because the paralysis symptoms I've experienced just a few moment ago are almost identical to when I lost consciousness. Could this really be K related... ? The warnings of the med says Hyperkalemia risks, but considering my chronic digestive issues (SIBO) in that nutrients and calories are badly absorbed (bulky stools), I would be most likely low than high...\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI still feel like I'm going to collapse and very wary about what to do next.\n\nWhat's your opinion on this?\n\nI'm thinking about going for some simple salty rice meal, avoid potassium and calcium entirely for the time being, and drink plenty of water... maybe sodium bicarbonate?\n\nThank you.",

I bleed heavy, and cramp before, during, and after my period. I\u2019d honestly say half of my life is spent in pain due to my cycle.

I can\u2019t honestly remember when I noticed them. They are right at hip level on my lower back, kind of where some people may have lower back dimples. They are in the same position on both sides. One side is significantly larger than the other. They change in size, and I\u2019ve noticed they seem larger around my period. The largest is the size of a golf ball in my back, but sometimes they\u2019re more penny-sized. They are moveable and you can manipulate them a bit but they never fully go away. Could these be some sort of gland becoming inflamed? The reason I think it\u2019s related to my period is because the majority of the pain on my period centers around those two areas and spreads. The pain in recent times has kept me from getting out of bed. I do TENS, heating pads, baths; no OTC painkiller gives any relief. I have tried everything. \n\nOther helpful info possibly: a fairly irregular cycle, sometimes 2 weeks in between periods, sometimes 3 or 4. I also have a history of ovarian cysts.

        "context": "ENT/Neurology: What tests do I need and how urgently should I be getting more care? (Carotid/brain/ear vascular issues)\n**About Me:** 39F, 5'7\" 122lbs, white\n\n**Medical Diagnoses:** Costochondritis (mild, comes and goes), major depression, OCD\n\n**Current Medications:** Prozac 20mg (started only a month ago), Xanax 0.5mg as needed\n\n**Current Supplements:** Vitamin D, Vitamin C, fish oil, CoQ10, Lipo Flavanoids (started a few days ago just to see if they help)\n\n**Lifestyle:** Never smoked, drink on occasion (only drink one when I do), active/exercise regularly\n\n**Primary Complaint:** Constant 24/7 high-pitched hissing tinnitus that is sometimes pulsatile. The constant tinnitus is in both ears, though the left ear is often louder and sometimes has an additional tone.\n\n**Details about the pulsatile tinnitus:** The tinnitus is usually constant, but becomes pulsatile when I:\n\n* **Bend over** \\- I'll get about 5 seconds of pulse-synchronous whooshing in both ears. It's not a low-pitched ultrasound noise, it's like my hissing tinnitus pulsing along to my heart (ssssSSSSsssSSSssSSSsssSSS)\n* **Stand up quickly** \\- Again, about 5 seconds of pulse-synchronous whooshing in both ears\n* **Turn my head all the way to the right** \\- Same, about 5 seconds of the whooshing\n\nIf I maintain the positions above, after the 5-ish seconds, the pulsing stops and the tinnitus hisses normally, non-pulsatile.\n\nOther times it is pulsatile is doing hard cardio **exercise**... this is when it pulses the most, I hear 3-5 seconds of whooshing (both ears) on every other exhale when my heart rate is raised and pumping hard. Otherwise, I feel GREAT when I exercise, my heart rate recovers quickly when I stop, no headaches or weakness, etc.\n\nSometimes, I hear the pulsing inside my tinnitus when I first wake up in the morning, or when I wake up from a vivid dream. This can sometimes take a little while to calm down and is sometimes louder in the left ear.\n\nThe constant tinnitus is extremely somatic. I can make it louder by turning my head to the right, bending my neck all the way back, pushing on my forehead, jutting my jaw out, etc. I can even 'fake' the exact sound it makes when it's actually pulse-synchronous by doing these movements... the sound is the same.\n\n**The weirdest thing:** during the times the tinnitus is pulsing, I can STOP the pulsing by closing my teeth together. I CANNOT stop the pulsing by pressing anywhere on my neck or throat (I know that's a common test for vascular PT) I also cannot make a recording of the pulsing, which tells me it is probably a subjective noise and not 'real'.\n\n**Duration of Complaint:** 2-3 years, I don't know exactly, but it's been going on for quite a long time.\n\n**Factors to Consider:** I have a history of going to air shows and concerts without ear protection. I also used to work wedding receptions. For the last several years I have been using AirPods on my 6-7 mile daily walks, and I definitely had the music up way too loud to hear over traffic/outside noise. I know this is why I have the constant tinnitus. What I don't understand is why it is sometimes pulsatile. I protect my hearing now.\n\n**Tests I have had:**\n\n* **Brain MRI, with and without contrast, with IAC protocol:** totally clear and 'normal'\n* **Blood tests:** not anemic, liver and kidney function fine, thyroid levels are normal. Vitamin levels were not tested.\n* **Blood Pressure:** runs low if anything, has never been elevated when measured\n* **Hearing Test:** All thresholds normal, symmetrical hearing, including some extended high frequencies tested\n* **LDL/Tympanometry:** Normal LDLs and normal pressures\n* **Vestibular tests:** found a slight unilateral hypofunction on the RIGHT side, which is my 'better' tinnitus ear.. test was done to diagnose 24/7 rocking dizziness for a few months post-COVID infection. I've since 'compensated' for this and no longer feel dizzy.\n* **Chest CTA/EKG/Echocardiogram:** These were done last month because of a bad septic pneumonia infection, not because of the pulsatile tinnitus, but everything was perfect so I'm including it here just to mention that there probably isn't a cardiac concern.\n* **Eye Exam:** included digital images of my optic nerves, no papilledema seen\n\nI never cared about the noise before until I started being anxious about it, but now it causes me a great deal of anxiety and I listen to it constantly. I feel like I can habituate to it again if I could remove the anxiety that something is really wrong, since Googling 'pulsatile tinnitus' leads you down some scary rabbit holes, which is why I started seeking a doctor to begin with.\n\nI've been seeing an ENT/Neurotologist specialist, who I thought would be the best person for this due to his hyper-specialty but he seems unconcerned about my specific symptoms? I had to push for even the standard contrast brain MRI. He thinks if my PT was anything super concerning it would only ever appear in one ear and would be a more constant 24/7 thing.\n\nI think all of you doctors on here are so generous with your time and expertise, and I'm hoping you can give me some basic advice... **with my specific symptoms should I just put this to rest, or should I be seeking more scans ( brain MRA or carotid ultrasound?) And how urgently should I be seeking this out?**\n\nI'm not really trying to hunt down a cause for the PT, but I DO want to make sure that there's nothing dangerous going on.\n\nI'm really, really struggling with the anxiety. It's led me to restart Prozac after saying, years ago, that I'd never go back on another SSRI.\n\n(edited to include eye exam info, fixed typos)",

I also am worried it might be a factor with my high ALT levels...\n\nAnd then there is the issue of: what if it's the buproprion and I do that for nothing? Should I quit the buproprion? I never had these issues when I took them at the same time.\n\nI am just trying to get advice on where I should best approach this issue, or if yall think this is all circumstantial and I should be looking at something else.

        "context": "My moms kidney function\nHello doctors,\n\nI am wondering if anyone can give me information about a kidney transplant after a double lung transplant?\n\nMy mom is 59F, complicated medical history including COPD and emphysema which was ultimately resolved via double lung transplant in January 2020. She did have diabetes after the surgery but that has also resolved. Now, 3.5 years later, my mom is facing the prospect of a kidney transplant. Apparently the anti rejection drugs are very toxic and as such, her kidney function is severely compromised. She had 1 hospitalization in march 2022 for kidney failure (it was terrifying)which kept her in the hospital an entire month. \n\nIn the last 3 months she has lost 30 pounds and weighs 97lbs now, about 5\u20195. The stress levels for our family have been huge, so that is definitely playing a huge role. \n\n6 weeks ago she was told dialysis is imminent with kidney functioning levels at 18. \n\nShe met with her care team on Wednesday this week and they said her kidney function is up to 30 now and they aren\u2019t looking at dialysis on the same timeline. They were quite shocked at the recovery. \n\nShe\u2019s supposed to meet with a vascular surgeon anyways so they can assess her for a port, as they feel it is inevitable she will eventually need dialysis. \n\nMy mom is in discomfort all the time. Her headaches, the horrible leg cramps every night, bowel issues, all of it is so much to endure for 1 person, her medication is life sustaining but it\u2019s also slowly killing her. Her kidney issues make it difficult for her to eat because her diet is so restricted. I\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t want the kidney Transplant because life is already so difficult with transplanted lungs. I\u2019m hoping to be the one to donate a kidney if she will proceed. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1.  Is it unusual for her kidney function to go up and down so much? \n\n2. if the situation Becomes acute, can she get dialysis right away or will they try to do a transplant immediately? \n\n3. Will the kidney transplant be physically easier to recover from than the lung transplant? \n\nSorry if this post is scattered, things are very difficult right now. \n\nMy mom is the centre of my world\u2026thank you very much for taking the time to read this. Any input would be appreciated.",

        "context": "Need advice for my partner (37M)\n\nNote: using a throwaway account.\n\nI have been with my partner for about seven years. We have chosen not to become legally married but consider ourselves in a domestic partnership (I mention this to note that while i consider him my husband and am dedicated to him as such, I don\u2019t have the legal rights a legal spouse might have).\n\nBackground details about him: He is white (non-Hispanic) and we live in the USA. He is a 37-year-old cisgender man. He has had long-standing mental health problems (mostly extreme anxiety) since getting sepsis at age 14 which he barely survived. He used to be a heavy drinker before we got together but rarely drinks now. He also used to smoke cigarettes (about 8 a day) and marijuana, but for the past month has cut back on both considerably. He drinks about one energy drink w caffeine daily. He doesn\u2019t do any other recreational drugs. He is prescribed vyvanse, gabapentin, and viibryd for daily use and he *says* he\u2019s been taking them, but I strongly suspect based on the pills he has on hand and his behavior that he hasn\u2019t been for probably 1.5-2 months. He also was prescribed Xanax for occasional panic attacks (so not for daily use) but I don\u2019t think he has taken any in probably 2+ months. He hasn\u2019t seen his psychiatrist in months either. The past year or so was an extremely stressful year for him at work, with the worst occurring about mid-spring of this year, and it was definitely rough for him considering his mental health problems. \n\nCurrent problem: for the past two months he has been declining in every way. He hasn\u2019t showered in at least a month and will only occasionally use bathing wipes I bought for him. He stopped going to work and won\u2019t get a job. He lost his phone for several weeks and had no interest in finding it, so he had to get a new one. He doesn\u2019t spend any time with me and was incredibly rude to his family when they visited last week. He sleeps a lot and spends much of his waking hours in a daze. But most concerningly, he\u2019s become increasingly difficult to converse with. Half of what he says doesn\u2019t make any sense or is filled with non-sequiters. When we went out to eat with his family, he couldn\u2019t even order for himself because he was in a daze. He makes strange jokes and doesn\u2019t remotely understand why me and his parents are concerned. Nor does he understand why he lost his job or why finding a job would be important. We have begged him to see a doctor and he won\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d need to. My husband used to be an extremely hard-worker, always kept up to date on cleaning the house, showered daily, and was very intelligent. We loved watching movies together and playing board games. Now he\u2019s a completely different person and I miss him so much.\n\nHis parents live in another state and the only reason they came here this past week was because I told them I was becoming very concerned. When they visited they agreed that something is wrong, and as the visit progressed they started to suspect, as I do, that despite my partner\u2019s mental health history, this may be something more than a psychiatric problem. It is genuinely hard to describe unless you interact with him, but to us his behavior may indicate something is neurologically, or possibly hormonally, wrong beyond mental illness.\n\nI have reached a point where I have no idea what to do. I have been googling advice and everything tells me either 1) do nothing bc he can make his own decisions, even though I don\u2019t think he\u2019s mentally well enough to do so, or 2) have him admitted to a psych hospital. I am open to the 2nd option if needed, however he is not suicidal or threatening harm to himself or others so idk if it would be an option and regardless, I really think he should be given a full medical evaluation before defaulting to psychiatric hospitalization. But I also don\u2019t know if I would be able to have him admitted to a regular hospital since this may not be an \u201cemergency.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m panicking at this point y\u2019all. It\u2019s hard to work, hard to sleep, hard to eat. And financially we\u2019re hurting. I am so afraid I\u2019m not only losing my husband as a partner, but that he could possibly be really sick. His parents are also confused about what steps to take going forward. Please, I really need advice on what, if anything, I can do to help him. Sorry if this is long or confusing, I\u2019m frazzled at this point.",

        "context": "Sinus pressure on palate after jaw surgery\nHi all,\n\nI am currently 32, male.  I am obese and take medications for blood pressure and anxiety.  I was born with an underbite and crossbite and so at approx. age 25 I started a two part orthognathic surgical process to correct this.  The first surgery, a SARPE (surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion) was uneventful, but the bone-borne palatal expander that was implanted in the roof of my mouth fractured a week after surgery (while being activated via the wrench provided) and was prematurely removed, while the doctors maintained the transverse width that I had achieved to that point and move forward with orthodontics in preparation for the second surgery.  The second surgery, a Le Fort I osteotomy, advanced the maxilla forward.  I then had several additional months of orthodontics.\n\nAfter the braces were removed it was clear that my crossbite remained, likely as a result of inadequate expansion of the maxilla because of the palatal expander failure.  I was recommended for a revision surgery which I had done in 2019.  The new surgeon removed the hardware (plates and screws) from the Le Fort I osteotomy and repeated the SARPE procedure from scratch.  \n\nAfter this repeat SARPE surgery, the upper right quadrant of teeth either shifted downward entirely or the teeth erupted downward and I suffered root resorption and gum recession on almost all right side maxillary as a result.  I also developed a burning sensation in the right side of the hard palate, and a sensation of fullness/inflation when I breathe through my nose.  If I perform a Valsalva maneuver and breathe into my nose I feel air pressure on almost all teeth on the right side of the maxilla (and not the left), and it feels as if something is \"inflating\" between my right-side hard palate/teeth and the floor of my right nostril.  Additionally, if I shift my mandible left to right it activates a sort of suction/popping that is both clearly audible but also felt in those same areas of the palate/nasal floor.  I do not believe this popping is coming from the jaw joints (TMJ).\n\nA recent CT scan at my periodontist showed fluid in the right maxillary sinus, but other than that my jaw surgeon (who did the revision) has offered no explanation, and neither has any orthodontist or the periodontist himself.  The periodontist has recommended seeing an ENT which I am doing next month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestions: \n\n1. Why did the right side of my maxilla/those teeth shift downward after the revision SARPE procedure?\n2. Why did the gums recede on those teeth at the same time as the downward shift?\n3. What is going on with the air pressure/popping/clicking in the palate/nasal floor?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy jaw surgeon has shrugged off my complaints and it has made me feel powerless over my own health.  Any advice is sincerely appreciated.",

My question is, how exactly does constipation happen in the bowels? If my son takes high enough doses of stool softeners and laxatives, he'll have one or two mushy poops per day. If he misses a dose or gets a smaller dose, the next day he will still poop, but it will be hard and small. The next day pebbles, and the day after that, he stops pooping altogether. When he gets back on the laxatives, he will go back and forth between pooping water and pooping pebbles until his stool gets back to normal consistency & frequency. \n\nHow could he go from soft wet poops to hard poops within a day? Wouldn't it need to be in his colon longer to get that hard? Does it mean that too much water is being pulled from his intestines?

She was able to pull it off, but it took a bit of skin with it. Yesterday, she noticed a bump behind her ear, and I saw that the two lymph nodes behind her ear (about 2\u201d down from the bite) are swollen.

But after a few weeks I was more stable than ever and thrived and I still do. I am in a way avoiding getting checked because I love riding this wave so much. Problem is I have begun getting these bone symptoms which I figured might be due to my possible lack of estrogen. \n\nBigger problem at the moment: I have always had weird bones, had an inflamed sternum at some point a few months ago but I evaluated it and it all seemed fine.

I showed my dentist that I\u2019ve been getting one large (1cm) tonsil stone per month the past 10 months or so. It has gotten to the point where it\u2019s made my tonsil red and swollen twice before dislodging. No bad breath, but she says there might be some stones or a salivary stone showing on the pano and to see an ENT for their opinion as the same bacteria appears to maybe be causing cavities on back teeth. She also thinks my tonsils are a bit big.

        "context": "Severe Tactile Sensitivity on Front of Neck [26M]\nSince Kindergarten, I've had tactile sensitivity issues that cause physical discomfort and anxiety for me. Growing up it was the seam of my sock that would bother me. When camping I sometimes feel bugs crawling on me even when there are no bugs present.  Starting in High School, I began to experience extreme sensitivity to the collar of my shirt resting on the front of my neck, and this symptom persists now. \n\nThe sensation is as though I am being tickled by a feather, which is highly distracting, makes me physically cringe, and worsens my anxiety symptoms. It occurs primarily when I wear a shirt with a rounded, average to tight collar. Loose collars present less of an issue and v-neck or loose button downs cause no issue. When wearing a rounded collar shirt, the symptoms worsen the further I lean backward, with lying completely flat leading to completely unbearable neck stimulation. Leaning forward reduces collar contact with my neck and relieves symptoms.\n\nSome potentially relevant background info:\n\nI have clinically diagnosed moderate anxiety, which I do not take medication for, but go to therapy. Anxiety flare ups lead to anxious tics (blinking, flexing certain muscles, cracking hands and neck, etc.) and OCD-like symptoms (need for bodily symmetry, intrusive thoughts). Questionnaires have confirmed I do not meet criteria for OCD, and I would agree it is not to that severity. I have been previously diagnosed with ADHD, then a second opinion psychiatrist told me I had bipolar type 2, but I'm skeptical of both these diagnoses (first one, I was pushing for the diagnosis to get Adderall, second one doctor was highly unprofessional and the depressive episode I was in at the time was linked to an adverse life event). \n\nI am not entirely convinced my neck sensitivity symptoms are fully psychosomatic, because it remains in the presence of low anxiety, however anxiety does worsen my ability to cope with neck tactile sensitivity. Neck sensitivity also increases anxiety symptoms. \n\nI have been coping by resting my hand on my upper chest, pulling collar off my neck, and leaning forward (which has lead to poor posture). I also have to be very particular with the shirts I wear, especially if I plan to be sitting for extended periods of time. \n\nI am hoping to either find new strategies to cope with this sensitivity, potential diagnoses, or recommendations for professionals I should see to address it. \n\nAny thought are appreciated, thank you!",

On birth control, spironolactone, buproprion, fluoxetine, and Zyrtec.\n\nI was diagnosed with IBS-D and internal hemorrhoids in 2014. This was after ruling out Crohn's disease through a colonoscopy/upper endoscopy - they initially thought I might have Crohn's because I reported some blood in my stool (not a lot, just enough for me to notice) and wanted to be sure it was just IBS. I had a course of antibiotics for it in I thiiink 2016? Since then I still have flare-ups/sensitivities to certain foods but not as bad as they used to be - it used to be that I'd have diarrhea no matter what I ate or how I was feeling and it felt totally random. I've never had treatment for the hemorrhoids - I was told they'd go away on their own. \n\nLast week, I had two back-to-back instances of blood in my stool. But like, a lot of blood. Like, \"I would think I was on my period because of how much blood there is in the toilet\" blood. The stool is normal \u2013 i.e. not diarrhea \u2013 but I did feel a little constipated, in that it felt like it took a long time to actually happen, even though I felt like I urgently had to go, and I had a bit of stomach cramping. \n\nI have had this happen twice before, but the last one was several months ago and the one before that was a few years ago. Since this most recent incident, and also in between the other ones, I've been perfectly fine with no weird symptoms or pain or anything. It's like something pops and then heals up by itself.\n\nMy thought is that it's just my hemorrhoids bleeding, but it *is* a lot of blood. I don't think I'm dying, since it's been a week and I'm fine. And I'd rather not go to the ER - the only hospital with two hours of me is out of network. But I don't want to ignore a very serious problem if it *is* a very serious problem. \n\nSo, my questions:\n\n* Is it something that looks scary but is actually fine, or is it something extremely bad? Or something else?\n* Whatever the problem is, do I need go to a gastroenterologist about it? And how urgently should I try to see them, if I do need to?",

Is this concerning for chronic pancreatitis?\n28 male. Negative for celiac, IBD, normal metabolic labs besides lipase and amylase. (152 and 156 respectively) once a month diarrea since 2019. No weight loss. Outside of cramping with the episodes of the runs I have no abdominal pain. However reading online it seems like the only possible causes for these long term symptoms are chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. But I\u2019ve never drank or smoked and have no family history of pancreatic disease.\n\n Is chronic pancreatitis unlikely here given my age and non drinking status as well as no abdominal pain? The fatty diarrea isn\u2019t consistent and comes about once maybe twice a month. Other times I can eat super fatty foods and be fine. \n\nTLDR: recurrent oily diarrhea with mildly elevated amylase and lipase for 4 years. Being in my 20\u2019s and having never drank and no family history as well as no abdominal pain outside of diarrhea cramps does that make chronic pancreatitis/pancreatic cancer unlikely? Are there other GI causes of those enzymes to be elevated?",

What do I do?\nI am a 35F with a history of back issues including a Schmorl's node that does cause pain, periodic inflammation and pain in the cartilage connecting my ribcage to my spine and breast bone, and muscle inflammation that causes pain. I also get tendonitis in both shoulders. Doctors have suggested chiropractic care and massages, as I'm told that most of my spinal issues are caused by inflamed muscles along my spine. I have seen pain management doctors who offered nothing besides cortisone shots. My mother does have fibromyalgia, but I'm told it's not genetic.\n\nI had a pinched nerve in my neck at the beginning of June, then again at the beginning of July. I've had this once or twice in my life, but this time it was back to back. I went to my chiropractor (and I know how reddit feels about that), and was able to get very quick relief. This time he recommended an x-ray, so we did that earlier this month. I was told that I've lost the curve in my cervical spine and that it's almost going the other way. [Here is an image of the x-ray](https://i.imgur.com/N6pwVUs.jpg). He told me to use a device I already owned ([similar to this one](https://www.amazon.com/Stretcher-Shoulder-Relaxer-Cervical-Traction/dp/B0C141Q82D)) twice a day for a total of 20 minutes, suggested that I use a pillow with a hole in the middle for back sleeping, which I already do, and purchase an adjustable desk for my work so that I don't have to bend my neck down as much during the day. \n\nMy question is, what else do I do? I'm already having issues from this at 35, so I can't imagine it won't get worse as I age. Is there anything else that can be done to help with this? What causes it? I was in a pretty bad accident about 15 years ago where I was side swiped and walked out with bruised ribs. Other than that, I can't think of any significant trauma. I read and craft a lot - could just looking down at a book or table cause this? Thank you in advance!",

There aren\u2019t many ocular cancer specialists so one of the few out here is very busy. He removed my suspicious eye mole and it turned out to be benign. Good news. The attending ocular cancer doc said I didn\u2019t need him anymore since I don\u2019t have cancer, and that the new intern would remove my eye sutures since my eye was pretty much done healing. Attending left the room. \n\nThe intern put numbing drops and a speculum on my eye and removed three sutures, then tried twice to remove one more. He finally stopped and said we were done. I asked if all the sutures were out and he said no. He said he could keep trying to remove the last one but that cause more irritation and make the suture go deeper into the eye, and I should just wait two to four weeks for it to dissolve. It would probably be sooner he said because it was a smaller piece of stitch. I was really disappointed about that because the stitches have been so uncomfortable in the two weeks since the mole removal surgery, and I still can\u2019t drive properly because looking too far to the left is painful.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize until I got home an hour later that maybe I should have asked for the attending to finish pulling the sutures out. I waited a day, then I called the clinic back to see if I could get in with an attending ophthalmologist to try removing the final stitch again. The receptionist put me on hold for a long time, said my ophthalmologist is out on vacation, and said she\u2019d get back to me in 24 hours to schedule with the next available provider who could do it. \n\nAny thoughts or advice would be appreciated, have been feeling down about this and having a painful stitch stuck in my eye.",

It worked like a charm and I continued wearing it for a couple of years.\n\nFast forward to May 2022 and my teeth start hurting again and I start developing tinnitus in my left ear (which I thought was form scratching my ear canal with a q-tip which I went urgent care for). I stopped using the night guard and everything went back to normal. I thought the problem was fixed, but the tinnitus never went away.\n\nNow go forward again to March 2023 and one day I randomly woke up and the entire lower half of my face felt heavy and tingling. I immediately called a dentist and made an appointment. He took an X-ray and saw that I had a tooth infection that was slowly eating away the bone in my face. (I think that's how he put it). It was too advanced for a root canal so I needed an extraction and was put on antibiotics. He said it must have been there for at least a year. \n\nI got the tooth removed, but the facial tingling and random feelings of burning and heaviness remain. Now, in recent weeks, my neck has been hurting and tinging up the back of my head. I have a mouth ulcer, my back even hurts, and I just feel generally sore. I went to my primary doctor and all my blood work was fine. I got a neck X-Ray and it was fine.  I don't know what to do. I'm miserable. Everything hurts and I feel depressed and anxious and I've had the dentist, the primary care doctor, and an ENT specialist all tell me they don't know what's going on. \n\nI deal with a lot of stress and anxiety and have since I was a kid. I'm diagnosed with OCD and General Anxiety Disorder, so I don't know if that's a factor. I'm at a loss. \n\nI know TMJ might be a factor, but I have almost no actual jaw pain or pain when I'm eating. It's all in my face and neck. And it's not even really pain. It always seems to get worse when I drink alcohol, get stressed, or do anything that affects my blood pressure.\n\nI just want answers.

I grind my teeth and wear a night guard so I was wearing it. One night I awoke with severe pain and a couple glands on the side I had my dental work were swollen and continued to hurt but after a day they went back down and the pain went away. I went back to have my dental work completed and as soon as it was done I had pain (which is to be expected) but the glands again swelled up. One located just below the jaw would become angry anytime I tried to chew on that side. The dentist said that this had nothing to do with any of the procedure , he ended up adjusting the tooth and it seemed to improve. However that side still feels odd to me (almost like a burning in a small spot along the jaw line) and I have seen the doctor twice and had fluid in my ear so I have been prescribed an antibiotic. The inside of the ear is very sensitive. I also however had perforated my eardrum on that side as well back in November 2022 but it had healed. So I\u2019m not sure if that could be the reason for the ear infections and sensitivity, although I did have an ear infection right after my perforation had healed so I figured that was the cause of the ear infections.\n\nShortly after I had my dental procedure I noticed that my night guard had black spots on it. I didn\u2019t really think much of it I just continued to clean my night guard daily soaking in a solution. I thought the spots were due to me always forgetting to remove it from the solution and letting it soak for longer than the recommended time. but the black spots don\u2019t go away and now I am worried it is black mold. I have not been wearing it but was wearing it not thinking about mold. I am now worried the symptoms I am feeling are related to mold. Could it be possible for mold to have gotten into my tooth and it is now growing inside? Which is why I am still experiencing the symptoms in my ear and jawline?\n\nI have been diagnosed with ADHD and I do have chronic pain as well as frequent migraines.

From my understanding,  repeated laparotomies every 1-2 years will only continue to make the situation with adhesions exponentially worse. Is there anything that could be done non-operatively to help prevent further repeated laparotomies from adhesion-related SBO? \n\nAlso, I couldn't seem to find a clear answer in the literature: if further operations and adhesions are more or less guaranteed either way, could I be any better off returning to a permanent ileostomy?   I've tried to research the rates of SBO after ileostomy vs ipaa, but there doesn't seem to be a clear consensus and little research specifically on the ileostomy side of it to begin with. \n\nI realize it may be a dumb question, but figure it can't hurt to ask since I am willing to try almost anything if it improves my quality of life.

I\u2019ve been experiencing very alarming symptoms over the past two weeks, the doctors are running out of tests to do, and I\u2019m hoping someone can help me.

I\u2019m getting increasingly fearful.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to summarise as best I can below:\n\n\nJuly 6th - First Episode \n\nDuring a run, I felt a sudden numbness in my left arm, shoulder down. I then felt light headed, like I was going to black out, and later experienced some chest pain (particularly when swallowing).\n\nI chalked this up to dehydration, and two days later boarded a flight for a weeklong holiday. During this time, I felt the numbness return when exerting myself.\n\nJuly 15th - Flight\n\nA little over a week after this first episode, I boarded a flight back home. Ten minutes before boarding I felt the numbness in my arm and lightheadedness return, though much more intense. During the flight, the symptoms became much worse, I experienced numbness all over my body, including my face and lips, as well as chest pain.\n\nI laid down with my legs raised, then ate some food and drank water and juice. After around an hour, the numbness and lightheadedness felt much less intense. After around three hours, both sensations returned. I was sent to the hospital as soon as I landed. \n\nJuly 16th -  Hospital\n\nThe Hospital performed blood tests, an ECG, a CT scan of my chest, and listened to my heart. I also received an Ultrasound. They did not observe anything abnormal. I went home and slept, the symptoms continued.\n\n\nJuly 17-20th -  Home and Doctor\n\nI still feel numbness occasionally, I\u2019m still having  chest tightness and pain, the main issue now being my head feeling lots of pressure, and quite heavy. If I walk more than a minute it gets really bad, my head feels really numb and my tongue feels heavy. Lying down seems to alleviate the heavy headedness.\n\nI\u2019ve had diarrhoea twice over this period, and random aches all over my body. \n\nAll blood tests are coming back clear, the doctors are running out of things to try. I was given all the usual blood tests for the heart (sorry I don\u2019t know the name). As well as stool and urine tests for bacteria or infections. \n\nThey did a brain scan and discovered a 47mm uncomplicated retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst in my brain, initially my doctor doesn\u2019t believe it could be making me have these symptoms. I\u2019ll be waiting a while to see a neurologist.\n\n\n\nOther information \n\nOn June 25th and July 1st I had been doing cocaine, I\u2019d also been drinking and vaping quite a bit on these weekends, as well as the week in between episodes (holiday). I haven\u2019t drank or smoked (or anything else) since the July 15th episode. Doctors think because the episode was 5 days after going out it\u2019s likely not the cause. \n\n\nThe doctors can\u2019t find anything to do with circulation, but the fact it happens after moving upright makes me think it has to be right?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Like I said even just recommending a specialist \ud83d\ude4f\n\n\n\n\n****one last thing If you\u2019re still reading.

Started October 2021-ish. I had a bisalpingectomy; during the procedure I had a catheter in, and afterwards developed a UTI. I\u2019ve had a few before, and this one like all the other was able to be treated with antibiotics. Since then though I have had issues where I can\u2019t empty my bladder fully. I have to push, which I know you\u2019re not supposed to do. No pain, just discomfort since it feels like I still have to pee after I\u2019ve just gone. The surgery is one event I can pinpoint so it was my initial assumption for why I\u2019m dealing with this, but after thinking on it, I did start my job that I\u2019m currently in around the same time as well. Before that I worked in an office.\n\nI work in conservation biology. I\u2019m almost always in remote areas when I\u2019m working, so I don\u2019t have access to a bathroom. Thus, I need to find somewhere and squat. Lately I\u2019ve been having some issues with urinary retention, so I saw a urologist, and she said that it\u2019s bad for women to squat to pee as it puts a lot of strain on the pelvic floor muscles, and as such it could be part of the reason for the issue I\u2019m experiencing. I was found to be holding I think 50ml? of urine after peeing during my appointment.\n\nIs this true? Did women not squat to pee before toilets became a common thing, and don\u2019t a lot of people without regular access to one squat? Is standing bad too? \n\nWe will be doing a urodynamic test next week, and she was curious about squatting and what effect it has on the pelvic floor and all that, so I offered to try to squat during the testing so we can do a little experiment. But I wanted to ask here to get some more opinions until then out of curiosity.  She even said that she would \u201calmost rather me hold it than squat\u201d which seems crazy to me, seeing as I work 10 hour days. Holding my pee that long I would think would be worse. She suggested to even get a small children\u2019s training toilet\u2026 which is not an option. Not only is that impractical to carry around with me while I am doing field work, but as a woman in a heavily male dominated field, there is no way I would feel comfortable carrying around a training toilet and whipping it out any time I have to pee. I\u2019ve already had some male coworkers act surprised that I, A WOMAN WOW!!, will pee outside\u2026 which is also crazy because what else do I do? Not pee all day?? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f lol. \n\nLast, if it\u2019s bad to squat, would standing be better, worse, the same? I know those she-wee things exist, and wouldn\u2019t be too bad to use if it helps. Much more discrete and portable. I thought of it after my appointment, so I plan on asking her this too.\n\nIf anyone has any other theories why I\u2019m experiencing this, please feel free to weigh in. I\u2019m not old enough to be dealing with this yet, and I\u2019m really worried. \ud83d\ude1e",

Turns out that all of my issues I had during pregnancy, the cause of my son\u2019s stillbirth, and my chest pain and dizziness were all a result of Rheumatic Heart Disease.\n\nI ended up having a stroke and I thought that would change my urgency of care, but still I was dismissed by all of my providers. My cardiologist was very condescending and said my issues, specifically worsening issues, such as extreme chest pain, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, feeling a cold fluid feeling in my chest, my swollen abdomen and feet, and a hard cough, were just the result of stress and anxiety. I asked for an updated echocardiogram since I had one last year and much has change with my symptoms. I was denied and said an echo was absolutely not needed in my case. \n\nI went to my primary care who was also condescending and said it was anxiety. At the point of anger and tears I told her I felt like I\u2019m dying and I needed help. She said she was not a cardiologist but if it would help me feel better she would order an echocardiogram at the local hospital. \n\nMonday I had the echo. Wednesday I was diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease affecting both the mitral and tricuspid valves. There is still no urgency from my care team. I\u2019m being ignored by my PCP. My cardiologist gave a half-hearted \u201cwe\u2019ll request the echo records\u201d when I called them. I feel even worse. My chest pain now only ends when I feel a burst of fluid that feels like it fills my chest and neck. I\u2019m having trouble breathing all the time. But if I have a feeling if I traveled to the ER again, I\u2019d be dismissed right away just like I was before in pregnancy and earlier postpartum. I\u2019ve had this chest pain for months and especially when I was pregnant but for all the 6 times I went to Labor and Delivery I was discharged right away and never given an EKG or any cardiac work up. Same with my OB. \n\nSeparately, I\u2019m seeing a neurologist for my TIA. He\u2019s found something doing an EEG and multiple MRIs. He won\u2019t tell me the results until my follow up on 2 weeks but told me I absolutely cannot work or drive. \n\nI\u2019m truly at a loss of what to do. If I call the office I get attitude from both the nurses and receptionists. I can\u2019t even find good information on this disease because it seems like it\u2019s not common in developed countries. I live in the US, I\u2019m upper-middle class, I have always taken my full course of antibiotics when I\u2019ve had strep. I just don\u2019t understand how of the thousands and thousands of dollars I\u2019ve spent trying to get help over the past few months all I have to show for it is a permanent heart condition, a dead child, and no plan moving forward.",

From Brazil. \n\nI have been to a private hospital concerning some moles. The derm told me it was suspicious and recommended me mole mapping and to return after a month for us to proceed regarding biopsy information and etc. I did the mapping and returned to the doctor but the doctor refereed me to another derm at the hospital because she doesn\u2019t do biopsy. She assured it was probably nothing but a precaution for me to biopsy my suspicious mole.\nShe called the other doctor right off the bat and asked him to request a biopsy in the hospital.\n He agreed over the phone and she gave me his contact. I messaged him after and he said he did, but when i tried to schedule, the hospital said i couldn\u2019t as i didn\u2019t have the biopsy request recorded under my name in the system. The second doctor didn\u2019t reply me anymore, i don\u2019t have the contact of the first and the hospital wasn\u2019t that much helpful. I contacted and asked them to contact the doctor. They said they were waiting for the doctor to give them a  reply\u2026\n I wasted a month dealing with these. \nEither i make a new appointment and start all over again to get the request. \nThe appointment i payed out my pocket and planned to pay the biopsy too out of my pocket even thought it is really expensive  because i was really anxious. The mapping too. I don\u2019t have health insurance plan. My fault, i wasn\u2019t that conscious of my health begore. Learned my lesson because everything was really expensive.\n\nSince the first doctor told me before i didn\u2019t need to panic and rush that much and all the scheduling with the hospital was stressful and very bureaucratic and a big waste of time, almost a month and in the end i still didn\u2019t get my biopsy done i decided to look for a health plan and get the biopsy more calmly.  After all, health insurance  would give me a peace of mind, the price be a bit more reasonable and a be safety net . Been talking to insurance plans sellers and we are almost sealing the deal. \n\nBut yesterday night i noticed the skin of my mole was dry. Winter started here and my skin has been very dry lately and i don\u2019t really apply any lotion but i got really worried. \nI will post the photo on the comments \u2026in the photo,  i already put lotion on the mole.\n\nThe shape, color and size are exactly as i showed before to the derms between these months. \n\nBut the skin of the mole got dry and i am concerned that maybe it had got worst.\nIs normal for the skin of the mole to get dry? Is it just dry skin? Or the docs here may see something more alarming? \nShould i rush to a private derm clinic to get a biopsy it asap or wait until i get my insurance and get it done at a hospital?",

I figured it was hygiene related, so I went to the bathroom, had a good wipe, and carried on with my day. The itch persisted, accompanied by blood on the stool that was about the size of a dime. The blood seemed fresh, bright red. This has been going on since then, and I seem to be visiting the bathroom quite a lot more frequently. Maybe about 4-5 times a day. The colour of the stool is a light brown, nothing too out of the ordinary for me. My symptoms also include some stomach discomfort in the mornings, but it\u2019s usually a good 30 mins after my morning coffee so I assume it is that. \nThe itch and discomfort seem to go away for a bit after a warm bath or prep h wipes, but worsen with any movement or sweat.

I have been on my current form or bc (Nuvaring) for about 3 years. About 2 years ago I went into urgent care for very heavy bleeding that would not stop. My hormones were tested at the time and they suggested I may have a pituitary tumor. An MRI later the only thing found was a Rathke\u2019s cleft cyst. \n\nFast forward to the past year, I have been seeing a naturopath where I have found that I have low progesterone which I am now taking HRT for and most recently low estrogen which I will begin HRT for as well. My most recent values (5mo on 150mg of progesterone) were Progesterone: 2.0 ng/mL and Estradiol: <5.0 pg/mL with the draw taken during the luteal phase. I\u2019m concerned about my sudden drop in estradiol as my last value 8 months ago was 19.7 pg/mL and also is luteal.\n\nI also have had issues with insulin resistance with my A1C consistently sitting at 5.7 for until my most recent blood work which was 5.4.

I did a gut healing protocol with a very very strict diet (no sugar, gluten, dairy, corn, fermented products) and was able to get down to 145-148 (depending on the day), but since then the scale has not budged.

        "context": "Female 50\nI need advice. My mom lives in a state where the medical professionals are extremely incompetent. A very small town full of people with very outdated education. She\u2019s been getting the run-around from doctors. Severe diagnoses that she\u2019s told they won\u2019t do anything about because it isn\u2019t severe enough. She\u2019s getting worse by the day and she\u2019s too sick to travel to neighboring states with better medical care. I would like to see what everyone thinks; maybe they have ideas these doctors haven\u2019t thought of? I\u2019m desperate to get her the proper treatment. Please bear with me while I describe everything that\u2019s going on as some of it is from my childhood. \n\nMy mom has been very sick for a few years now. She has had health issues due to alcohol abuse such as going into afib sporadically while I was growing up. It was usually just a weekend at the hospital and she was okay. I want to say she\u2019s been at high risk for a stroke because of this? If not, she certainly is now. \n\nShe used to smoke methamphetamine (I can\u2019t remember how much or for how long) and she smoked marijuana for about 40 years. So, she\u2019s always had something of a cough. \n\nI wish I could remember exactly what her symptoms were when all of this started but we didn\u2019t talk very much during that time. I do remember she was having reactions on her skin to what seemed like anything and everything. The doctors gave her a prescription for some sort of cortisol cream but I can\u2019t remember if it ever helped her. I don\u2019t think so or else she would have used it consistently and I don\u2019t think she did. \n\nShe was diagnosed with ITP (I can\u2019t remember when) and as far as we know it\u2019s in remission. However, when her health started to decline she was unable to take medications for what was happening because she was allergic to the meds or she couldn\u2019t take them with ITP. \n\nWhen she moved states, the skin issues exasperated. The climate is dry, windy, high plains. She also contracted COVID at least 3x since moving. We believe the wind exasperated her cough. Her tests show that it looks like her lungs are full of \u201cground up glass.\u201d She was given an inhaler to help but whenever she uses it she gets thrush. Not sure where this fits in but she also came down with the shingles a few times. She actually has a spot right now that is healing. \n\nAt this point, her cough is getting worse, she\u2019s extremely uncomfortable and in quite a bit of pain daily. She\u2019s feeling run down and sore (she also has fibromyalgia). Here, there\u2019s another bit of time that we weren\u2019t in touch much so I can\u2019t speak to the progression to what\u2019s going on now. Her health just continued to decline. \n\nTo skip over the details of her being sickly over the next (I wanna say) year.. she has been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis and she has a growing cyst on her heart. We do have an oxygen concentrator at home, fortunately. However, her oxygen will still drop down to the high 80\u2019s-lower 90\u2019s if she does the slightest bit of activity. I\u2019m talking, she ran out of breath sitting at the table chopping veggies. She has been waiting now over a month to see a heart surgeon to know if she will require open heart surgery. They wrote down her appointment on the card they gave her and then called to let her know she missed it. The reality is-they wrote down the wrong date. Or, they messed up on the schedule. So now, she has to wait another month (2 months now) to know if she will need the surgery while her symptoms progress. \n\nShe has been fevered almost constantly. Stubbornness is a family trait and the hospital isn\u2019t a fun place to be so she tried riding out a fever of 103 for about a week. I assume this made everything worse. Now, she gets very dizzy to where the whole room spins if she does too much activity (like taking a bath, even). Possibly related? \n\nThere have been a few incidents of her legs or arms randomly giving out on her and her falling down. About a month ago, she was told that she ruptured a disc in her low back. I expect that may have something to do with this? \n\nToday, my grandma had to call 911 and have her rushed to the hospital in an ambulance (I am out of town). She woke up with her oxygen levels in the 60\u2019s and fevered again. There would have been no way for her to even get herself out of bed. She is in the hospital now and being monitored but I don\u2019t have an update other than that. \n\nAny thoughts/suggestions? She just turned 50 in June and nobody else in our family has problems like this.",

No history of drug use, occasional smoking and drinking. \n\nI had recently undergone two procedures for a Root Canal on tooth #10. First being a Calcium Hydroxide treatment, second being the actual Root Canal Therapy. Now, even with this, my original endodontist had said this may not be enough and recommended me for an Apicoectomy procedure. I understand that this is a last ditch effort and there is a good likelihood I am going to lose the tooth. I am trying to figure how soon should I expect symptoms to arise, if any.\n\nPrior to the procedures, I was completely unawars of any issues with this tooth. I had absolutely no pain or discomfort, and was only made aware that I needed a Root Canal when my regular Dentist had said so. I had waited about a month from this meeting, no pain or discomfort. I received Calcium Hydroxide treatment and had my next Root Canal treatment a month later. This entire period, I had no pain or discomfort. I never had any pain or discomfort the entire timespan this took place. \n\nNow, I come in for my Apicoectomy to a different Endodontist from the previously stated one, on recommendation of the previous one. It felt EXTREMELY rushed. The entire process took about 20-25 minutes. For reference, each Root Canal appointment took about 1 hour. Not even 10 seconds after applying numbing gel, the surgeon began poking me with Novacaine repeatedly. It legitimately made my eyes water from the discomfort. After waiting about 2-3 minutes, he began going to town on my gums and bone. Now, I have no idea what went on or what happened, but it felt like the entire time he was working, he was trying to just finish as quick as possible. Once he finished, he did not show me X-Rays or anything else, he simply gave some instructions regarding aftercare and took off. They did not give me antibiotics either. All of this felt off to me. \n\nI am now wondering if I should follow up with anyone and whether or not I could be in serious trouble in terms of my health. I do have scans of my tooth from pre-procedure (these were provided by the original Endodontist who did my CH and RCT treatments, not the one who did my Apicoectomy) and will DM them if requested.",

This is for a very close friend who's like a second mom to me.\n\nThey found in may a very large tumor (9cm) in her right kidney. She didn't have any symptoms other than a high blood pressure that lead to her PC ordering a scanner and that's when they found the tumor. They did a whole body scan and also found some \"small lesions\" (I'm not sure of the exact term used) in the head of her pancreas, but the word \"metastasis\" was never used. The glands and veins surrounding her kidney was tumor-free. Her left kidney is completely untouched. \n\nShe just had a kidney ablation yesterday, they took out her whole right kidney, the surgery lasted 3h through cealioscopy and surgeon said everything went perfect. They didn't touch the head of pancreas and said the \"lesions\" are really tiny and they will monitor them in the next few months to see if they evolve, in which case they will be doing something about it (what, I don't know).\n\nMy question is: what to expect now? The surgeon went to see her this morning after she woke up and said they will probably put her under \"medication\" soon, I saw some mixed infos on internet, does this \"treatment\" means she's gonna need immunotherapy or is it most likely be some sort of anti coagulant medication for after the surgery?\n\nDoes that means she's now cancer free, since they removed the organ that hosted the tumor (we don't know if the pancreas thing is linked to the kidney cancer or not)? What should we expect next? I know she will be supervised at least for the next five years to see any evolutions in her organs and see if the cancer comes back, but could someone explain what is most likely to happen to her now, and what her prognosis might be (even though I understand there is no way for you guys to give an accurate answer given that you haven't seen her medical record).  \n\n\nAny insight would be greatly appreciated.

I was drugged for most of it, probably some kind of pain killer or sedative. I was also often left with physical trauma and regularly had tearing and bleeding. \n\nWhen I was about 10 I got my period, but I thought it was just from my abuse, so I didn't realize. Thus, no one knew. When I was 11, I had (what I now know as an adult) a miscarriage by myself. I had no idea I was pregnant so I didn't tell anyone. Some people had started to comment on my stomach growing, making jokes about me getting fat and looking pregnant. But I had no sex education or knowledge at all of biology, so I was just confused. Anyway, I'll spare the details unless they are needed, but I passed a fetus and a LOT of blood and tissue. The fetus was kind of deformed and the color was kind of purple, the head still had a kind of lima bean shaped with black dots (?) for eyes. It had legs arms and the beginning of nubs for toes and fingers. It was about the size of my palm, maybe a little smaller. I am wondering if by that description anyone would be able to give an estimate for how far along I was? I bled pretty heavily for three days and just faked a stomach bug. \n\nMy next question has to do with my health now. I have VERY painful menstruation. It feels like blood just collects in my organs and feels like they are going to burst. The lighter my period is, the more it hurts. The only thing that's ever helped some us being on the birth control pill. I've had pelvic ultrasounds, and I do have ovarian cysts but no evidence of abnormal endometrial tissue. My hormone levels also suggested PCOS, so that is what they diagnosed me with. My obgyn also has commented that I have one of the smallest cervix openings she has ever seen. She was like visibly shocked the first time she examined me. \n\nAlso, the first time I had PIV sex as an adult (24 years old), my hymen was already broken and damaged from childhood, so there was no tearing there, but my vagina inside was like ..blocked? It took a while and a lot of force to actual get my inner vaginal cannal to open. It was not vaginismus, as I've experienced that. My muscles where very relaxed and it wasn't a lubrication problem. It was like an internal blockage. Once I finally got past it, there was almost like a popping sensation and a LOT of blood. But after that, no problems with PIV sex. \n\nOne other thing I should mention is I have memories of being hospitalized for a few days with some kind of vaginal injury as a kid, maybe 6 years old, I definitely had some kind of surgical procedure under anesthesia. I remember my parents telling the doctors it was due to a bike accident. Unfortunately, all of my medical records were wiped at the hospital so they can give me no information (long story).\n\nThanks for reading all of that. Does anyone have any feedback for me?

My doctor calls me into his office after this and explains that there is nothing he can do for me, and I just have to deal with the pain. No recovery advice, no specialists that can help me, nada, he told me to exercise, which is extremely difficult with the back pain!! \n\nI have Fibromyalgia, and I think that it is causing the pain to be as extreme as it is, when it flares up I cannot even walk for days or sometimes even weeks, what can I do to help?? Who should I be reaching out to? \n\n ",

For anyone wondering, she basically said skin types are a myth (except for acne-prone and another type; but oily or dry or whatever else is just dependent on environmental factors) and moisturizers are a racket, and I should just stick with cerave, Cetaphil, or Neutrogena. \n\nAnyway, while I was there, I sort of mentioned in passing that I'd recently had trouble with swollen eyelids. It happened once on one eyelid and lasted about a day. I didn't know the cause. Then, it happened again to both eyelids with far greater severity and lasted about 3 days. This time, every environmental factor was different, because I was on vacation. The only thing the same was that I had done my nails the night before (something I never do and had just started doing for a string of weddings). After some googling, I figured it was irritant contact dermatitis. I went to the urgent care, and they gave me a corticosteroid shot which helped after about a day. Some time later, I was too lazy to wash my mascara off with face wash and used bathroom wipes, which noticeably dried my eyelid skin out, and the swelling came the next day. \n\nI explained this history to the dermatologist, and she said she could prescribe me a topical ointment for the next time it happens. So, she did. I picked it up and forgot about it. Well, now, about a year later, my eyelid is furiously swollen (just one this time). It started with a feeling like my eyelid was bruised on Monday night. Tuesday I woke up to swelling. Now it's Wednesday and the swelling is even worse. I don't even know what would have caused it this time. I'm stumped. But I suddenly remembered the ointment I was prescribed, so I went downstairs and found it. It's called Desonide ointment (low potency - ~0.05% I think). The label clearly states in large, bold font: AVOID CONTACT WITH EYES. \n\nObviously, the dermatologist who prescribed me this knew that the issue was with my eyelids, but she prescribed it nonetheless. So, am I correct in thinking it is fine for me to use this on my eyelids despite the warnings if I am careful not to let it get into my eyes? Or is it not worth the risk, and I should just take some ibuprofen and wait for the swelling to go down on its own? For what it's worth, I tried a warm compress last night before bed, and it doesn't seem to have helped. \n\nThanks in advance :(",

Also trying to see if my tte/echo is normal or not. \n\nPMH: anxiety and depression (being managed with meds and regular talk therapy), eating disorder (bulimia) now resolved, exercise induced asthma (which now also feels resolved), frequent headaches but only occasional migraines, low vitamin D \n\nMeds: multivitamin and 5 mg lexapro daily, vitamin D weekly, just recently prescribed hydrochlorothiazide for my leg swelling PRN  \n\n2 years ago I had multiple episodes of dizziness and lightheadedness but never fully passed out. I also began having heart palpitations frequently. At the time, I was on spironolactone for my acne, so my cardiologist told me to stop because he thought it was causing my dizzy spells. My BP has also always run on the low side. \n\nThe dizzy spells have gotten better, but now i have leg swelling (worse with prolonged standing and drinking alcohol) and my legs feel incredibly heavy when I run (I\u2019m training for my 3rd half marathon and my pace is slower than my last by about 4 minutes per mile which is crazy). I had an uncontrollable weight gain of about 40 pounds in 1 year (most of which feels like it\u2019s in my stomach) without significant change to my diet and exercise apart from starting 5 mg of Lexapro daily. \n\nI am also SO SO fatigued, almost all of the time and feel like my exercise tolerance is reduced greatly.  I do try really hard to get 7-9 hours of sleep every night. \n\nI work a very active job, work out several times a week, and I am decently conscious about what I eat. \n\nI did wear a Holter monitor for two weeks after my first dizzy spell, which only showed PVCs and PACs that my cardiologist said he was not worried about. I will say that once at my PCPs office, I got an EKG done which noted first-degree heart block, but my doctor said he was not concerned. \n\nI have also had increased floaters in both eyes, along with frequent headaches and difficulty sleeping, so I have a sleep study scheduled in a few months to see if OSA is to blame. \n\nA neurologist did an MRI due to the headaches, increased eye, floaters, and weight gain to check for a pituitary tumor. But this was all clear despite him noting papilledema on exam. \n\nMy endocrinologist also did a test to check for Cushing\u2019s which came back negative.\n\nBasic thyroid, liver, and testosterone labs have come back normal as well. \n\nSo at this point, I have seen a ton of doctors who can\u2019t tell me why I feel poorly and fatigued so much of the time, but my recent increase in leg swelling, did convince my PCP to send me for an echo/TTE of my heart. \n\nLong story short, I snapped a quick pic of some of my echo images before I left the room and didn\u2019t know if anyone would be able to tell me if anything on these pictures look abnormal because waiting for the results to come back and for my doc to call with them is just about to kill me. Happy to message anyone the image who feels like they could have some input.\n\nI also wanted to see if anyone had advice on where to go next if my echo ends up being normal. \n\nThanks in advance for any advice/input.

(The small spike was (63-126-69-67 in a minute) Spike is 64-132 and it stays around 120s-130s mostly, gets to 143 for a few seconds in the middle then end 126 down to 75>73 in the same minute. I wish I could post pictures because it stays relatively consistent. No big spikes or dips which you would think you would see if a heart arrhythmia. NAD so that\u2019s why I\u2019m on this sub. This sub didn\u2019t allow pictures but I posted on the pvc forum and there are pictures there. I had it on exercise mode so it was continuously taking my HR while I slept.

The younger one (now 7) was born at 36 weeks and had very strong jaundice. He was later diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 8 months. Atypical presentation, over 100 seizures a day, after we finally found the right medication he has been now seizure free for over 4 years. But he has other \"issues\" as well: distinctive facial features (v. similar to Kabuki syndrome), curvy fingers, underdeveloped toenails, cupped ears, high arched palate and dental abnormalities (missing adult tooth - confirmed by x ray), joined teeth, small and pointy teeth in lower jaw. Additionally, he is diagnosed with Autism and ADHD and is developmentally delayed in all areas (he attends special school). Until 3 yo his height was under the 9 th percentile, but now he is at the 75 th.  \nMy older son (now 10) also had infant jaundice, but he was born on time. He was diagnosed with autism a few months ago. He has very severe anxiety (requires antidepressants and warranted visits to A&E) and similar teeth (joined milk teeth and missing adult tooth), fingers and toes features. Also very high-arched palate. I suspect some seizure activity (absences), but we're on the waiting list to neuro.  \n\n\nMy younger son had genetic tests done. They checked epilepsy, ectodermal features and intellectual   \ndisabilities panels (https://nhsgms-panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/). Nothing came up. We were told that he has similar features to Kabuki syndrome, but because of lack of short posture and no problems with feeding we were told there is not enough to give the clinical diagnosis. Apart from epilepsy no serious medical problems. Geneticist were \"sure\" there are some genetic causes (we were even told that probably two separate problems - one causing neurodevelopmental and ectodermal issues, another for epilepsy) even before my older son got an autism diagnosis, but again - later we got no results.  \n\n\nWhat could we be missing? It seems almost impossible that there is nothing in the genes bearing in mind my boys' similarities. It is really hard to not know what to expect. I have two boys who are legally disabled, with high support needs, but we have no idea what really is going on.  \n",

The veins tend to look much thicker and larger during the end of the day than in the morning, and dehydration makes them pop out even further. In the pictures I provided it was late night and I wasn't particularly dehydrated.\n\nI do not have any existing relevant medical issues and I am not taking medication, but I drink occasionally. I also have a small burn mark on my left foot caused by hot oil. I believe that sodium is also a contributing factor to the appearance of these veins but I have been cutting my sodium instake in hopes that it will help a little bit to reduce the thickness. I did not consume much sodium at all on the day where I took these images.\n\nDoes this look like it could be serious? If so what should I do? I do not have varicose veins on my legs, only my feet and I do not have veinous insufficiency. The veins do not hurt either, they are just really unpleasant to look at. My father believes it's not a serious issue and likely just genetic, but I'm worried that it could potentially be more than a cosmetic issue as I have never seen veins this thick on feet before. \n\nI'm really desperate to know how to go about this, any thoughts?",

The study essentially demonstrates extensive venous uptake and contamination without evidence of lymph ectasia, lymphedema, or other lymphatic abnormality.\n\nThere are several benign/normal-appearing lymph nodes in the right inguinal region ranging in size from a few millimeters up to 1.1 cm. These are morphologically normal.\n\n*7/23 US* - Multiple enlarged lymph nodes. The largest lymph node is 3.6 cm in greatest dimension. No central necrosis at any of the lymph nodes. No abnormal fluid collection in the area of concern.  Right inguinal adenopathy. This may be reactive. Malignant adenopathy not excluded.\n\n\n**QUESTIONS**\n\nWhat is intranodal angiosis (in 4/21 biopsy)?  Blood vessels growing in to the lymph node caused the enlargement?  If so, why were they growing there?  Could intranodal angiosis be causing other nodes to swell in the same region?\n\nIs the spleen stuff of any concern relative to the lymph nodes swelling?  I was never informed of the spleen cyst, I just found it reading the report recently, so I assume it's not important.\n\nI understand that the US can't rule out malignancy, but can it detect malignancy?  Surely cancerous nodes have some distinct differences from healthy nodes to make them look 'scary', right? \n\nGiven the nearly 1 year time span between the MRA and the most recent US, is it of any use to the size of the lymph nodes from one to the other?  Or is it just, \"eh, a lot could happen in a year, lymph nodes change size all the time,\"  considering that mine seem to be ONLY increasing in size.  \n\nAny advice on where to go from here?  I'd like to avoid biopsy if at all possible.\n\n*ETA a timeline, incase it's helpful:*\n\n**TIMELINE:**\n\nJan 2020 - Swollen lymph node in hip\n\nAugust 2020 - CT and Appendectomy \n\nFebruary 2021 - Transvaginal US and STD test (all normal)\n\nMarch 2021 - US of lymph node, focused only on swollen node directly in the bend of hip\n\nApril 2021 - lymph node biopsy\n\nMay 2021 - sclerotherapy and drain placement to treat seroma/lymphocele\n\nAugust 2021 - upper thigh/hip swelling, suspected to be secondary lymphedema despite atypical presentation  (proximal, localized swelling)\n\nJune 2022 - MRA, lymphangiogram\n\nJuly 2023 - US of thigh",

        "context": "Could it be cerebral palsy or something else (20F)?\nHi-- It's me again, I posted yesterday about toe walking and am following up because I received two distinct comments suggesting cerebral palsy as a possible explanation for my symptoms. I just want guidance on if it is worth bringing to a neurologist, because healthcare is expensive and I'm not sure if my university offers neurology as part of their clinic. I compiled a list, by no means exhaustive, of my symptoms and would love to have some feedback.\n\n**Background:**\n\nFirst things first, I was born premature and was in the N-ICU for some time (I think a few days to a week, I will verify). I was due mid-February (2003) but was born mid-January, 25 days early. My mom dealt with pre-eclampsia and was a high-risk pregnancy. Apparently, I came out purple, though I do not like to think about it too much. The following symptoms have been lifelong for me, though they tend to be worsened by other factors such as not getting enough sleep. My younger sisters (twins, born 2005) were an even higher risk pregnancy that left my mom bedridden for the third trimester. The doctors were concerned one of them would have cerebral palsy, and they were born very prematurely, spending the first few years of their life in OT and PT. Neither sister went on to have any lasting conditions, thankfully, and are happy, healthy, athletic, teenagers today. My sisters were born only two years after me, but they were born in the States and I was born in the Netherlands, meaning there was an entirely different team of doctors and an entirely different hospital, and maybe even protocol/perspective.\n\n**Obligatory Information:**\n\n20F, 145lbs, 5'7, Lamictal and Concerta (haven't taken in a while because of summer), ADHD, OCD, bp II, cough-induced asthma. Was in the ICU for a few days back in 2015 due to double bacterial pneumonia.\n\n**Coordination and Balance:**\n\nI've always felt like my limbs are just a little bit too long for my body and that my brain's mapping of them stopped a couple of inches early. I am frequently banging into things, hitting door frames, edges of tables, tripping over my feet, etc. It makes some things, like doing my hair, very hard as I do not have the dexterity. I also find that I will often break or rip things when I am just trying to gently handle them. For example, toast. I'll try to butter it and end up with my knife slipping through the bread. I drop things all of the time, multiple times a day including my phone, pens, pencils. Sometimes it's because I am holding them and my hand hits my thigh when I am walking, other times they just literally fall out of my hands.\n\nI  struggled with sports as well, despite how much I tried. I ran track for all four years of high school, which meant 1.5 hours of practice each weekday. We did weight and strength training, both bodyweight and with machines, as well as cardio. Despite how much I trained, I found that I wasn't building the same muscle mass as my peers and that I wasn't improving. I kept with it though, because the exercise was good for my mind and soul. There were times in gym class where I struggled with very basic tasks, like kicking a soccer ball under a foldable table. I couldn't even do that right. It hit the edge of the table and bounced back at me, and when I tried to kick it again, my foot missed! It was always attributed to me not trying hard enough, and I guess sometimes I would pretend that I didn't care, when really I did, because it is easier to attribute my brutal unathleticism to apathy rather than inability, especially because it came so easy to my peers.\n\nI have also taken two dance classes in college, and both of them were frustrating for not only me, but the instructor and whoever I was dancing with. I understood the dances and the steps conceptually, but I just couldn't get it right when the time came to actually execute the moves. I would trip over my feet, step on my partner's toes, mix up my lefts and rights, etc. I showed up every single class, but couldn't manage to get an A- one of the only people in the grade distribution to have not.\n\nI sprained my ankle during one of the dance classes, and a week later sprained it the other way which landed me in a boot for three weeks. When the doctor looked at it, he also mentioned that I have ligament laxity.\n\n**Toe Walking:**\n\nI have walked on my toes since I was a child. Though the issue has seemed to correct itself when I am wearing shoes, the moment that I am barefoot I am on my toes. I think it has impacted me in more ways than once thought, as I cannot even do a basic squat with my feet flat on the ground.\n\n**Cognitive:**\n\nGrowing up, I was very sensitive and learned to worry as soon as I learned how to think. I was, and am, very spacey and was diagnosed with ADHD-C around age 16, though my teachers suggested it could be a possibility years and years and years before. I don't want to get into why it wasn't addressed, but a lot of health concerns were not addressed when I was a child-- I was kind of the \"rub some dirt on it you'll be fine\" kid. I struggle with extreme mood swings and panic attacks as well as OCD. I also have a huge startle reflex which is kind of embarrassing, but I always attributed it to being \"wound up\" and anxious all of the time. But there have been times when, say, a door slams, for example, and I am the only one in the room with a reaction, a reaction where I nearly jump out of my seat. Cognitively, I never felt behind in my understanding of concepts but I find them difficult to verbalize, which is why writing is my saving grace. I really struggled in school, but that was more because I was picked on for being somewhat eccentric.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI know that these things are impossible to diagnose over the internet, but some clarity and guidance would be much appreciated. I think that I am just frustrated and tired and looking for answers so I can live my best, healthiest, life. I for sure want to correct my toe walking so it doesn't become a problem later on, and beyond that, I would like to find the cause if there is any. Thank you so much for your time in reading this, and I hope that you have a splendid day!",

Also 3 times this has happened to me where I smell things that aren\u2019t there such as rotten eggs, burning oil, and then after a few minutes the smell changes to maple syrup and then goes away after 5 minutes. \n\nMy primary doctor insists this is just anxiety and only ordered blood tests on me and told me to see a therapist which I have for 5 months now without very much change in symptoms other than they aren\u2019t freaking me out as much.\n\nMy main question is could my symptoms be a sign of something more serious or perhaps just an anxiety disorder?

GP referred me for a colonoscopy just in case to rule out early IBD.\n\nBefore I could get the colonoscopy (long queues) I got very ill at the end of June with bloody diarrhea, 38,5+ fever and abdominal pain. As my CRP was at 200+ and CT showed pancolitis I was admitted to the hospital, treated with IV antibiotics and a stool sample showed campylobacter. Once my CRP was lower I got discharged, but after 2 days was back at square one with similar symptoms, once again admitted and treated with IV antibiotics.\n\nHowever this time no bacteria were found either in my stool nor my blood. After a week of treatment my CRP was at 20ish and I got discharged again......only to be ill one week later with very high fever 39+, again elevated CRP at 190, lower left abdominal pain and some loose stools. Repeated CT showed colitis in my left colon and a colonoscopy was scheduled promptly. Again treated with IV antibiotics, which again, improved my CRP.\n\nThe colonoscopy showed segemental, well defined and non-bleeding ulcerations and reddening/thickening of the colon from my transverse to my sigmoid colon (most heavy inflammation in left descending and sigmoid) and based on the visuals alone the doctors couldn't determine if it was Crohn's or ulcerations due to infection. All other areas (rectum, right colon, cecum etc where without any pathological changes). They took biopsies of the inflamed areas, and while during the wait for the results I got prednisone 40mg/ day.\n\nOn the day I received the results that the biopsies showed that the inflammation was clearly due to infection and no signs of IBD were seen my CRP was 7 and I was discharged from the hospital. At this point, both antibiotics (1 week course) and prednisone was discontinued.\n\nNow one week has gone since I've been discharged and on my follow up my CRP has risen back to 44. So far I have no fever and bowel movements are better (somewhat formed). The infectious disease doc is however starting to mention IBD again - which has me worried because I thought that the biopsies ruled it out.\n\nHence my question: Is it possible that the biopsies missed Crohn's and are a false negative?\n\nThanks",

Described in the report as \"left distal pretibial region.\" I've had it for around 2 years and I haven't noticed any changes during that time. It is a relatively hard little something underneath the skin. It does not hurt or have any tenderness, it can move around a bit, the skin above it appears normal, just raised.\n\nI went to a dermatologist to get it checked out and they were not very concerned, thinking it could be a calcium deposit, but after some time recommended excision just to be safe.\n\nIt was excised 8 days ago now. It seemed to me that it was fixed to something so the procedure took a bit long, my guess is that it was fixed to the layer of skin above it? They got it removed and it was maybe around the size of a kernel of corn? A bit smaller than that maybe. Smaller than a pea for sure. Bigger than a grain of rice. The report lists \"neoplasm of uncertain behavior\" which I understand to be a relatively useless term at this stage of the process. It also says \"Depth of Biopsy - adipose tissue\"\n\nThe doctor told me prior to the procedure that she would put a rush on the biopsy since she could tell I was very anxious about it.\n\nI can see in the report that they are doing \"H and E\" staining which I understand to be relatively standard, but 6 days after the excision they called me and told me the results would be delayed because they need to do \"additional stains\" on the sample. I was quite worried by this because it seems to me that if it was a simple benign tumor there probably wouldn't be the need for more stains, so I feel like my odds of having a malignancy have just shot up and I am feeling extremely anxious.\n\nCan someone add some color to the situation and maybe talk me off the anxiety ledge here?

The drum inflates. My left ear doesn't do this.\n\nWhat could be the cause? Is there something to fix this? I'm tired of feeling like I have to read peoples lips to talk to them.\n\nThank you!",

I work 30 hours a week at a department store, I just don\u2019t work out. I\u2019m 6FT and 175, so in the average weight range. My family does tend to gain fat in certain areas more than others, such as stomach or thighs. Recently it feels like there is a slight fluid retention or build up in my left arm for about 2 weeks. It doesn\u2019t really appear to have gotten worse, but it\u2019s not gotten \u201cbetter\u201d either. First thought was maybe some kind of edema, but there is no pitting or really sizable increase in my arm. I also was thinking lymphedema but i realized there\u2019s no putting, my skin isn\u2019t tight or hard, and my arm doesn\u2019t really feel heavy at all. It just feels like some fluid may be moving around when I press on certain parts of the top of my arm. I will say i don\u2019t have the greatest diet. I frequently eat fruits and vegetables and homemade food, but I eat fast food probably 1-2 times a week. Sometimes zero, sometimes 3 times. I don\u2019t have any health conditions besides mild asthma and bad allergies. I have, in the past, had low blood sugar but it seems to have cleared up over time. I do Not have diabetes. I\u2019m not really worried, but am I overthinking it? Can fat sometimes feel like fluid? My right arm looks the same size as my left, and my friend agreed. I can\u2019t really make a trip to the doctor or er within the next 2 weeks, it\u2019s just not in my capabilities right now. Any ideas? Is it possible im just feeling fat that I previously didn\u2019t notice (I have gained 5 pounds in the past 2 months, due to a slightly poorer diet. I had been the same weight for a year.)

The veins tend to look much thicker and larger during the end of the day than in the morning, and dehydration makes them pop out even further. In the pictures I provided it was late night and I wasn't particularly dehydrated.\n\nI do not have any existing relevant medical issues and I am not taking medication, but I drink occasionally. I also have a small burn mark on my left foot caused by hot oil. I believe that sodium is also a contributing factor to the appearance of these veins but I have been cutting my sodium instake in hopes that it will help a little bit to reduce the thickness. I did not consume much sodium at all on the day where I took these images.\n\nDoes this look like it could be serious? If so what should I do? I do not have varicose veins on my legs, only my feet and I do not have veinous insufficiency. The veins do not hurt either, they are just really unpleasant to look at. My father believes it's not a serious issue and likely just genetic, but I'm worried that it could potentially be more than a cosmetic issue as I have never seen veins this thick on feet before. \n\nI'm really desperate to know how to go about this, any thoughts?",

The lump stopped protruding after a few days, but when I lay down on my left side it becomes very prominent. The day after, I developed a pain on the inside of my neck whenever I swallow. There are also two small dark patches on the front of my neck which I first noticed a month ago. They resemble a bruise or healed burn but I did not sustain any injuries to my neck.\n\n\nI visited a doctor with other symptoms two days after the neck pain began (namely: migraine, stuffy dry nose, fluid dripping out of my nose when head is bowed, cough, fatigue, and the lump), had my nostrils examined and was given a prescription for mometasone nasal spray. I used the spray but it did not offer any sinus relief, though my symptoms gradually got better (which I don\u2019t think was because of the spray). I suffered from night sweats and my migraine turned into a headache that felt like my head would implode for a few days during the recovery process. About 3 days ago the left side of my waist has also begun hurting whenever I cough or bend/twist. The spot is where my kidney would be and it *feels* like tendon/ligament pain (compared to muscle pain, stabbing pain etc).\n\n\nToday all that is left are the symptoms on my neck and coughing, but I still struggle with night sweats every other night (had it maybe twice in my life prior to this). I got a covid booster and flu shot about 20 days ago, a few weeks after my iron infusion in early June. From those blood tests, I also know I have a below average WBC count. I am worried because the day I landed overseas (back in early May), I suffered from the exact same symptoms as the bout of sickness I recently went through. The symptoms stopped when I arrived back home (12 days total). There are no patterns for when I begin getting sick, and it is not contagious (shared hotel rooms and tour bus seats with two family members 24/7 and they did not get sick). \n\n\nI have read about CSF leaks but highly doubt I have one. I just can\u2019t imagine what other sickness this could be? Especially since I have no history of allergies or sinus issues and it is the middle of winter here in Sydney.

My entire life up to that point, I pooped once every two to three days, and according to my doctors before then, that was just what was normal for me. I wasn't constipated - when I felt the need to go, I did, and there was no problem, the poop looked normal, it wasn't painful, didn't feel blocked, etc. In 2013, I suddenly started to need to poop every day (which I realize is the norm for most people).  \nThis was at the same point that I felt a kind of distant pain behind my belly button, which also coincided with a change in ejaculation. Previous to that point, I had always ejaculated a significant amount, and fairly long distances. With the distant pain and the change in pooping, the amount of ejaculate significantly lessened, and there was no longer any \"shooting.\" The feeling was much less intense, and frankly not as pleasurable as it had been. This is where it has been ever since. The pain eventually disappeared, and has not reoccurred. About a year before all of this, I started experiencing reflux - no clue if that's related at all. I was not on any medication at that time, other than popping famotidine for the reflux.  \nI went to my doctor at the time with all of this, an older dude who was totally checked out and ready to retire, he didn't seem interested and didn't ask me many questions or seem to think anything was amiss.

Described in the report as \"left distal pretibial region.\" I've had it for around 2 years and I haven't noticed any changes during that time. It is a relatively hard little something underneath the skin. It does not hurt or have any tenderness, it can move around a bit, the skin above it appears normal, just raised.\n\nI went to a dermatologist to get it checked out and they were not very concerned, thinking it could be a calcium deposit, but after some time recommended excision just to be safe.\n\nIt was excised 8 days ago now. It seemed to me that it was fixed to something so the procedure took a bit long, my guess is that it was fixed to the layer of skin above it? They got it removed and it was maybe around the size of a kernel of corn? A bit smaller than that maybe. Smaller than a pea for sure. Bigger than a grain of rice. The report lists \"neoplasm of uncertain behavior\" which I understand to be a relatively useless term at this stage of the process. It also says \"Depth of Biopsy - adipose tissue\"\n\nThe doctor told me prior to the procedure that she would put a rush on the biopsy since she could tell I was very anxious about it.\n\nI can see in the report that they are doing \"H and E\" staining which I understand to be relatively standard, but 6 days after the excision they called me and told me the results would be delayed because they need to do \"additional stains\" on the sample.
