I live in Southern California, I am a 5'7\" 140lb 27 Y/O Male who is very athletic. I eat clean, I exercise regularly, and take multivitamins. \n\nI was two months into the Sheriff academy when on the weekend of June 10th 2023 I got sick. Headache, nausea, chest congestion and an overall feeling of exhaustion. I've been sick before, so this wasn't alarming. I was coughing up yellow/green phlegm that following week, and was trying to dial it down but the intensity of the sheriff academy, my pride, and pushy instructors who don't \"allow you\" to be sick got the better of me, and I trained through it. Over the next few week I felt off but generally okay, all symptoms had subsided except I was coughing up green phlegm still, and I felt like I was operating at 70% capacity. I was still running 7-9 Miles at a 7 Minute flat pace, but I felt terrible doing it. At this time I was living in barracks housing, which was old, dirty, and there was mold present in some areas. \n\nFast forward a few weeks, I choose to remove myself from the academy for a variety of reasons, my wife and daughter needed me at home, my daughter is autistic and being away for weeks at a time was too hard on her, I was still sick, and ultimately I felt the job wasn't for me. Still coughing up green phlegm on Jun 26th I went to urgent care. The Physician I saw said I probably have bronchitis and prescribed the following:\n\ndoxycycline (MONODOX) 100 MG capsule (2 a day for 10 days)\r  \nalbuterol 108 (90 Base) MCG/ACT inhaler\r  \nmethylprednisolone (MEDROL DOSEPACK) 4 MG tablet (6-5-4-3-2-1 daily doses)\n\nI took 9 days worth of the antibiotic, but it was making me feel worse, and I skipped the last dose the 10th day. I took the steroid, as directed, with the exception of one day where I missed one of the four doses. \n\nAfter all that, I developed bad sinus pressure and nasal congestion, and the chest congestion was still present. I don't have the urge to cough, but when I exhale hard and deep, or \"Huff\" I can hear the crackling and can cough up the green mucus. Usually by the afternoon I feel halfway decent and most of my congestion has eased. But the next day I start all over again; plugged nose, green mucus, chest congestion, face pressure. I live at elevation and when I drive down the hill for work I get plugged up, ear pain, and sinus pressure. OTC stuff doesn't seem to help.\n\nI went back to the same urgent care on 7/14, the PA who saw me essentially told me to continue waiting it out, was very dismissive of me, and reluctantly ordered chest and sinus X-Rays of which I am still awaiting results.\n\nUltimately, as of today I am still sick, closing in on 40 days straight of CRAP! I have never been sick for this long in my entire life. Am I overthinking it? Do I just keep waiting? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nANY ADVICE IS GREATLY APPRECIATED, and I will promptly answer any questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks\n\n&#x200B;",

I left with crutches and picked up an aircast boot as instructed, and was told to stay off of it until seen by the orthopaedic surgeon at the fracture clinic who would contact me.\n\nI saw the surgeon a week later and he basically just said I could walk on the aircast boot and gradually wean out of it over 6-8 weeks as I was able. Both he and my family GP whom I had spoken to on the phone a few days prior said that only my metatarsal appeared fractured when I asked about the ankle.  He didn't assess or comment on the ankle (or anything else) any further and I left it at that, being focused on just dealing with my first broken bone.\n\nFast forward to today, I feel confident that my foot fracture has been healing steadily, I only feel the occasional tenderness there if anything at all.   I started gradually switching from the boot to good quality runners (which I wear in the house also) a few weeks ago and now don't really use the boot anymore.  However, my ankle is still swollen to varying degrees from barely noticeable to quite a bit, seemingly aggravated I think by being on my feet but not yet sure that's the trigger. This swelling comes on around my whole ankle, both sides and above and below. Also, my foot is sometimes very noticeably discolored compared to the other one, usually darker and reddish, once or twice it's been a bit paler.  I'm not sure yet what brings that on either.\n\nI'm seeing my family doc in person for the first time Thursday, the point of that visit being just to confirm my return to work the following week. But I'm starting to worry (ok, and sometimes work myself into enough of a panic to post on reddit) that I should have gotten this ankle properly looked at and there's something more problematic going on.  Would be extremely appreciative for any opinion whether I should be pushing for some sort of further imaging or assessment, or whether I can stay the course and consider this relatively 'normal' healing.  Thanks very much in advance for any input.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/MxZRDl1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/MxZRDl1.jpg)\n\nPhoto of swelling this evening. It is often much less than this, but also sometimes worse. A couple of times it really swelled up badly, possibly aggravated by high sodium intake that day or just being on my feet.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/0agSrfB.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/0agSrfB.jpg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/U6QA7r6.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/U6QA7r6.jpg)\n\nAnkle xray plus foot just for the heck of it. I didn't see anything with the ankle either but could there have been a bone chip or something else that's causing this inflammation?",

        "context": "Feelings of unbalance/emptiness with anxiety\n[20M] for nearly two months, I had been dealing with some rough anxiety along with a good couple of panic attacks. There's been feelings as if I'm not even in my own body and/or I feel unbalanced and empty. This all started with a nosebleed that was chalked up to just because of the heat. At first I was pretty concerned about it but after realizing it really was probably just the heat, I hadn't thought much of it and even felt normal for a few days. These attacks and feelings however quickly came back up and had been happening daily to varying severity. Sometimes I just felt really uneasy and sometimes I had straight up panic attacks along with those feelings of emptiness and unbalance all throughout.\n\nMy blood, heart, and lungs are all fine as I had gotten them checked for peace of mind and was also only prescribed some Hydroxyzine and told to seek a Psychiatrist. I have started taking Melatonin in these recent times as I've had bad enough trouble with sleeping my whole life but now while this is happening, it's become far less effective with me only getting 1-3 hours of sleep. I haven't felt any real physical pain though aside from chest pains during and after those panic attacks presumably because of hyperventilation. \n\nNow for the past 3-ish days, my anxiety has been very minor but that really unbalanced empty feeling still remains throughout the whole day which I can only describe as being dizzy but without feeling like your head is spinning or nausea. What does this mean?",

        "context": "Could these be gallstone attacks? Liver problems? Something worse? Or just something somatic?\nF28, 160 cm, 70 kg\n\nMedication: 2x20mg omeprazole, 1 one billion unit probiotic, and 3x60 mg alverine and simethicone daily for a colitis flareup (prescribed for a month, I\u2019m starting the third week), plus 1x500 mg extended release metformin, 2 myo-inositol, 1 vitamin D supplement daily, and .025mg cabergoline weekly to treat PCOS and elevated prolactin levels (prescribed for three months before checkup, also starting the third week) \n\nOn January I went to a GP about another colitis flareup, my main symptoms were bloating and starting to feel some fatigue. The GP only did a physical checkup, didn\u2019t ask for blood tests or other analysis. I complained mostly about pain/discomfort on my right side, right under the ribcage, and she told me she was ruling out liver problems on the basis alone that the pain didn\u2019t worsen in the area while she was feeling around. She prescribed me a week-long treatment and I felt a lot better.\r\n\nAround May I began experiencing a lot of stress and noticed I began bloating again, but due to financial problems I could only ignore it. It worsened with time, albeit slightly, and just at the beginning of July I was able to invest in getting checkups again.\r\n\nI started with a gynecologist due to some discomfort on my breasts, which to be honest caused me to panic and stress even more over the fear of it being breast cancer, but after an ultrasound and blood test, the doctor explained it was only an increase on my prolactin levels, a vitamin D deficiency and a couple of hormones having inverted values, as well as my insulin resistance flaring up again. I must admit I spent almost everyday at home until very recently, and my diet is/was not the best, so the vitamin D deficiency didn\u2019t really come as a surprise (from a baseline of =<30, I had 9.43). Still, the almost three-week waiting period raised up hell in my already uncomfortable gut.\r\n\nI took those blood work results to a gastroenterologist in case they were useful to her, since I read that vitamin D and prolactin are metabolized through the liver, but she disregarded them quickly. My symptoms were the same as the ones in January: I was uncomfortably bloated, spicy and greasy foods, which I had been honestly abusing lately, weren\u2019t sitting right with me and I had occasional diarrhea, although with no blood on sight. I also felt discomfort on my right side, right under my ribcage, again. During the physical checkup she also semi-ruled out liver problems, but still asked for a liver and bile duct ultrasound and a 32-element blood work to make sure.\r\n\nThe ultrasound report says: \"Moderate grade fatty liver, cholelithiasis without bile duct dilation\", and recommended to check certain values, which are as follows (I\u2019ll include the lab baseline values in parenthesis next to my values, since I live outside the USA and don\u2019t know if they vary):\r  \nAlbumin: 4.80 (3.97-4.94)\r  \nAlkaline phosphatase: 75.1 (35.0-104.0)\r  \nBilirubin: 0.57 (<=1.20)\r  \nALT: 32.9 (<=33.0)\r  \nAST: 21.9 (<=32.0)\r  \nGGT: 16.4 (<=40.0)\r  \nThe ultrasound also recommended to check TP, TPT and prothrombin time, but my initial blood work didn\u2019t include it.\r\n\nThe gastroenterologist said she would let me know if it was necessary to go see her earlier when I sent my results, otherwise she would see me in a month. She only confirmed she had received my blood work and ultrasounds and didn\u2019t add anything else, so I\u2019m assuming I\u2019ll see her at the beginning of August.\r\n\nNow, starting on the third week of all the medicine I have to take, I\u2019ve noticed only small changes: I\u2019m not as bloated, but I\u2019m still bloated. I\u2019m not really feeling hungry (but I have to admit, I\u2019m also a very anxious person and normally during elevated anxiety periods I lose appetite completely). I burp after eating anything, no matter how little it is (for example, I burped after having two peach gummies the other day). My bowel movements go from slight constipation to slight diarrhea and they are consistently a soft brown color (I wouldn\u2019t call it clay-colored, but it\u2019s definitely lighter than my normal bowel movements). The general discomfort under my right ribcage has improved considerably, although when I get nervous/anxious I feel it. But now, every now and then, I feel little, very defined stabby pains in that area, instead of just general discomfort/ache. I would describe them as someone poking me with a sharp object. The pain lasts a few seconds at most and then goes away, but it leaves me scared. I\u2019m also sometimes dizzy and slightly nauseous, but haven\u2019t really thrown up during the treatment (and even before that, in a long time).\r\n\nNow, the thing is I don\u2019t know if these could be gallbladder attacks or the fatty liver acting up. Even if I go to sleep feeling those discomforts, I always wake up without them. Sometimes symptoms start shortly after waking up, but I\u2019ve noticed that happens only on days when I\u2019m feeling overtly-anxious and obsessively scanning my body. I can exercise without a problem and I\u2019ve noticed that even improves my overall perceived state. Still no blood on sight in my stool, and no traces of jaundice in my skin or eyes, although my eyes have also been very dry and kinda bloodshot, if that could be relevant?\r\n\nCould someone give me an insight of what could be happening? I must admit, again, that I have horrible health anxiety, so my fears range from gallstone attacks, to liver problems, to some sort of cancer (no other reason other than some blood values being so high while others are normal, though I admit I know nothing about it so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s truly an indication of something being severely wrong), so I don\u2019t know if I should go see another gastroenterologist sooner and push for an endoscopy/colonoscopy/something of the sort right now, or just wait a couple weeks more to see what my doc has to say. I\u2019d appreciate any comment.\r  \n",

I am male, 35 years old, white, average height and build, no significant past medical history. \n\nYesterday I engaged in consensual BDSM sex for the first time. Something unexpected happened, in that my partner bit down on my penis mid-shaft and roughly squeezed my left testicle. This was startling and painful, but we were both more shocked by the small drop of blood that immediately appeared from my urethral meatus. We stopped, and I took the opportunity to go and empty my bladder. I kept my pants on the rest of the night, we made no further attempts to engage in oral sex nor any penetrative sex. \n\nI've seen no more blood since that initial single drop, not last night nor at all today, and it has not been painful to urinate today (last night it was just a bit sensitive the first time). On my penis, there's no swelling, redness, bruising or any other visible mark, no pain on urination, maybe the faintest general discomfort sort of localised towards the tip. My left testicle feels a bit tender and could be a little larger, or it might just be in my head, if it is swollen it is certainly subtle (my partner didn't know this but my left testicle has been aching on and off for over a year, for which my GP prescribed \"watch and wait\"). I haven't tried to get erect since last night so I don't know if that would cause any pain. \n\nThis has all been somewhat mortifying. Obviously the safe answer is \"go see a doctor\". I'd rather not, especially not if it will just be a wasted trip where they say \"you look fine, no obvious signs/symptoms, come back if it gets worse\". Not that it should matter, but I know it does - I'm in the UK, on the NHS. Is it fine to just skip the humiliation of a first trip and only go if anything changes?

I (31F) had a rash start about a week ago that got progressively worse, contact dermatitis. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve had it but it\u2019s worse than usual. The rash is about 3 inches long and one inch wide.\n\nI initially was prescribed clobetasol to apply, it started leaking a yellow odorless fluid so I consulted telehealth again. They advised me to stop the clobetasol and prescribed me Cephalexin thinking it\u2019s infected.  They also advised i could take Benadryl to help with itching which i am doing. I started taking the antibiotics two nights ago so it is fairly new. It\u2019s slightly raised but painless, but has continued to ooze.  I was not given any other guidance on care.\n\nI\u2019ve kept it covered during the day with gauze due to being at work during the day. I use a scent free soap and dab to dry and apply aveeno eczema lotion (colloidal oatmeal).\n\nIs there anything else I should be doing or should stop? Does it look like I should consider an in person medical appointment?\n\nNo diagnosed medical conditions, I take a nasal spray daily.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/kvWLtpM",

Always feeling tired and sleepy, difficulty waking up in the morning so often oversleeps.\n\n2. Currently taking lamotrigine for my epilepsy (general, idiopathic) - for 3 years already\nBut epilepsy started when i was 10 y.o.\nMy meds could have contributed to my sleepiness but even before taking it, i still easily get tired. I even tried dozing off in the middle of an exam. Sometimes sleepy and feels like floating while walking along session road\n\n3. Epilepsy trigerred by painful menstruation (definitely adenomyosis, probably endometriosis too)\nor sleep lower than 6 hrs\n\n4. I sometimes suddenly wake up at night and feel dizzy. My heart also beat so fast. I think that I will have an epileptic attack when i experience this.\n\n5. I have GERD. Experience post nasal drip. Difficulty talking for long periods of time which makes it difficult to teach.\n\n6. Painful legs and feet almost everyday. I like to walk but minimize it cause I have flat foot.\nSometimes my calf just hurts so bad. I also easily get cramps to the extent that I couldn't walk sometimes, even if I just sit down for 30 mins.\nMy back also hurts sometimes to the point that I couldnt wake up.\n\n7. Preliminary assessment is I have ADD (without the H in adhd cause i don't have energy), little bit of OCD, and low spatial intelligence. With this, I have difficulty studying (and so other tasks). It would take me about 20 mins to finish 1 page. It depends with the font, it could even take an hour. In a word (esp those used in science and med), I can only remember the 1st and last syllables. I am also always day-dreaming so I hope I won't be bumped by a car one day because of being absent minded.\n\nI feel that I am too slow when studying or doing tasks in the day time but I can't go on with lack of sleep either. How can I be able to go to med school with these? \n\nI tried Sertraline and apparently, I am sensitive (forgot what particular type of sensitivity but it's not common for other patients of my former dr.). I was nearly sent to the ER because I thought I was dying with all the dizziness and vomiting. Thank God did not have a seizure though (i wouldn't want to lose more brain cells when i already have so little).\n\nNow, I'm thinking of taking methylplenidate (along with lamotrigine which is my maintenance) but I was traumatized with the Sertraline.\n\nOther possible needed info:\n24F\n5'3\" 55 kg\nDiet: no pork, usually eggs or oats for breakfast, veggies with beef or liver, pasta with tuna, banana snd others (depending on what's available)\nExercise: one step higher than sedentary, exercise bike at home (in my defense, i am very busy and don't know how to manage my time properly, it's difficult for me. And I'm flat footed so even if i like taking a walk, i must minimize it. Probably lack of discipline too cause I wake up at 10:00 or 10:30 if i don't have to go to school. I really do my very best to improve my habits but I really can't wake-up.)\n\nMy activities: taking up masters (online only about 5 hours a week), teaching undergrad classes part-time (14 hours a week only) , doing online writing jobs (almost every evening)\n\nHow can I solve these? Though this may sound absurd to some, I am truly experiencing this. I have been to several doctors but I haven't really improved yet. I'm not blaming or questioning their expertise because it is a \"me\" problem but I still would want other perspectives/ medical opinions on my case.\n\nThanks so much for spending your time reading this.",

He was placed on a ventilator and then had to have a tracheostomy shortly thereafter. He has been weaned from the ventilator by some miracle and is no longer on antibiotics, but is still trached and has a stomach-placed feeding tube.  \n\nWhile his care team has been great, I am getting conflicting information about how symptoms will progress. Some nurses he sees day to day have told me how he will continue to deteriorate from here, but the \"main\" family-facing care managers and head nurses are not so straightforward. They keep it very vague and are sometimes, I think, optimistic so as not to upset us. I am looking for resources or explanations that are in-depth and describe what to expect \\*realistically\\* as his disease continues to progress and how it will affect his body and mind. \n\nToday he told me he had vivid and terrifying hallucinations during the night and into the morning. His respiratory nurse told me that may be due to high Co2 buildup, which is understandable. I'd like to know what is in store for him as he continues to live out the disease so I can know what to begin to expect.

I don\u2019t want it to happen again, it really scared and freaked me out. \n\n\nI was diagnosed with tic disorder in late spring of 2020 which I had just started my teens at the time. I have more tics some days than others, but they especially flare up outside my home because I have bad social phobia/anxiety. \n\nSince the beginning of this summer my tics have just been getting worse. Like I said they happen more some days then others but it\u2019s just at a constant now. But that\u2019s not what I was scared about, it\u2019s a little weird that my tics are flaring up for no reason but I mean it\u2019s not that much of a uncommon thing from what I know.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain. The past few nights I wake up in a half conscious/asleep state jolting and almost immediately fall back to sleep within seconds. (Which isn\u2019t abnormal in general for anyone. Except I never jolted like this when half conscious/asleep.) But not as much as this, like back to back all night every few minutes these past few nights. I didn\u2019t think much about it because I thought it was just because of me being uncomfortable or just having trouble sleeping. Around 4am this morning it happened again but this time when I woke up I gasped jolted while still laying on my side unable to breathe or move while feeling nauseous having a tic. I close my eyes letting out a strong exhale from being unable to breathe then everything went black. Same thing happened again and again. But the more it happened I became more conscious/not half asleep and things wouldn\u2019t go black immediately after closing my eyes. \n\nThe last time I woke up (haven\u2019t been back asleep since) and it happened and didn\u2019t stop. I had a tic attack(?) for over a hour. Along with that I would just blank out while it happened at some points, only a little though. I cant tell if it was me falling asleep or just kinda, I don\u2019t know blanking out? They just wouldn\u2019t stop and I could hardly breathe. I was able to exhale and catch a quick breathe if it was a in between. The more it happened the more nauseous I felt and panting from trying to catch a breath made it worse. And half of the tics weren\u2019t quick jerks like the ones I usually have. Half of them were like a jerk then freeze while feeling like I\u2019m stretching my body out along with shaking sometimes spasming unable to breathe, then after maybe 10-15 seconds (there was a mix of how long it lasted some were shorter and some were longer) my body would relax/unfreeze then I\u2019d exhale and it happens again after or a few seconds after. Some didn\u2019t even allow me to catch and breath after exhaling. Along with that I think I was having vocal tics to I\u2019m not sure though. I was making noises like moans/groans and sharply gasping. I never had vocal tics before I only ever had simple motor tics like neck/head jerks, hitting, doing weird stuff with my hands, eye movements, etc. \n\n\nI don\u2019t know if I having tics in my sleep or developed a new tic or something? \nIs this a tic?\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry for my horrible writing and description, I\u2019m dyslexic. I hope this somewhat made sense. What happened this morning freaked me out and I don\u2019t have anyone I could talk to or ask about it without being pushed down or ignored. \n(even though this probably isn\u2019t anything worth listening to i\u2019m sorry)\n\nThank you for reading, again I\u2019m sorry for the horrible writing.

Anxiety?\nBackstory and will try to be short and sweet so it may actually get read:  \nMale, 34, live in Phoenix, from the midwest, Former D1 football player, retired early from a knee injury when I was 19. Amazing family, friends, etc my entire life. Never thought once about having anxiety or that it could be potentially what causes my symptoms, but if not that then what?  \n\\-In March of 2015 I woke up one day at 11am, I felt like i never slept the night before even though I had gone to bed at 10pm or so. I always was a 10pm go to sleep, 6am wake up and work out person. Always in great shape, eating healthy, etc, never done drugs, drink maybe once every couple months. The fatigue was so extreme I just figured I needed more sleep but this never went away.   \nI got very sick (some sort of food poisoning) in Thailand a few months before and thought it could be something related to that but I had been back to normal and perfectly fine for 2 months before the fatigue and many other symptoms began...  \nEvery Day since that day in 2015 I have woke up severely fatigued, and also have been severely fatigued almost all day long. The fatigue is so extreme that I can barely keep my eyes open when its at its worse.   \nOther symptoms that have gone on at the same time:\n\n  \n\\- Extreme Fatigue, Heavy eyes, bloodshot (I can't explain how bad the level of fatigue is because its not something a normal person would ever feel. I played college football, worked on farms in the morning, had 2 practices a day, lifted, went to class, etc and I wasn't 1/10th of the exhausted I am now)  \n\\- Dandruff  \n\\- Muscle cramps, specifically in my ribs when I am twisting to wipe or twisting for another reason  \n\\- Sinus issues  \n\\- Arm pit sweating (usually this is social)  \n\\- Itchy Anus with rashes (I shower now every time after #2 and it doesn't matter)  \n\\- Occasional dizziness & sharp headaches  \n\\- Heart Palpitations  \n\\- Elevated Blood Pressure (140/90 range)\n\n  \nI went to doctors from 2015-2018 and did every blood test they could think of, CT scans, chest/ab scans, had a colonoscopy, had 2 sinus surgeries, eye exams, sinus exams, had all my amalgam fillings removed and even root canals removed, allergy testing for weeks, did allergy shots for a year, sleep study at home, sleep study in a clinic over night, went to naturopaths and tried different methods they suggested with meds, yeast, etc. I have seen nearly ever single specialty doctor you can think of.   \nDiagnosis from doctors: One wanted to put me on Blood pressure meds when I was 28. I know me blood pressure was never high or elevated until i started feeling miserable everyday so I didnt take them after a few weeks. Couple other doctors told me anxiety and prescribed meds but i never took them as I thought that was a BS response and easy way out. Others have said Chronic fatigue syndrome but most of the symptoms aren't relevant. Had biopsy on rash on itchy anus and came back completely normal. All my blood tests, scans, etc have always came back perfectly normal.  \nWhy I think anxiety or something with mental health could be the cause of all of this:\n\n  \n\\- The best I feel is when I am outside mowing, golfing, working on the house, showering, sex or masturbating, being pretty active doing something I enjoy doing. The fatigue(which is by far my worst symptom) almost vanishes when Im more active in one way or another.  \n\\- If I am inside sitting on couch or chair or laying down or watching TV or at the grocery story or furniture store etc my fatigue is almost always extremely severe where my eyes are so blood shot and I can't function  \n\\- I know I have had health anxiety in the past to some extent. I thought in elementary I had neck cancer because I kept doing this certain stretch with my neck that I always felt I needed to do. I had a panic attack and went to the ER in 2013 when I thought i was having a heart attack randomly. When the ice bucket challenge was going on, I had pins and needles all over my body for 2 weeks following that after doing a bit of research on ALS. I do frequently look on google for my symptoms or someone else with a similar story and have never found one.  \n\\- When my symptoms are present its  all i can think about. I cant enjoy anything because the fatigue is so bad its all i can think of and it will even make me nauseaus.  \n\\- I have always had intrusive thoughts. Never would I ever act on anything but always kind of felt it was weird but figured others had them too (example: in the huddle with football coach and thinking, if I just punched him in the face what would everyone do\")  \n\\- When we are going somewhere where I have felt extreme fatigue before, I cant stop thinking about it and then of course the fatigue is very bad there  \n\\- Many times before something social I will get extremely fatigued but when I get talking to people or having fun It usually gets better  \n\\- I can be extremely fatigued sitting in my house watching tv and then go out in the sun and mow the lawn or go for a walk and almost always feel less fatigued and somewhat normal  \n\\- I feel like my thoughts have always been able to create symptoms no matter what I do to try to stop them but I can't get rid of it.  \n\\- I've had premature ejaculation in the past with girlfriends when I knew we were likely going to have sex and its all i could think about, I would PE almost immediately when i took my pants off (sorry for the TMI).  \n\\- I've also had ED with long term girlfriend and fiance when I knew it was in my head.'  \n\\- My arm pits will sweat out of control in certain situations that I don't want to sweat and I am usually thinking \"don't sweat\" and then I do profusely.   \n\\- If I am sick or have a bad cold I actually feel less fatigued ( I think because my mind is on something else)  \n\\- My symptoms have never got better but they've also never got worse. They have been almost exactly the same for 8 years and counting.  \nAfter writing all this down I feel everyone will be like that is obviously anxiety but the problem is I never felt anxious at all unless I was extremely fatigued. So I have always thought the extreme fatigue was causing my anxiety because it doesn't allow me to do many things that I want to do.   \nIf it is anxiety, do I get on Meds? I was prescribed Lexapro via ForHIMS a few months ago after filling out the quiz to see if it was anxiety. I honestly have been afraid to take them because I dont want it to make me even more fatigued than I already am where I can barely function at all when I have a child to care for now. Do I talk to a therapist? If my mind is causing all of this, How do i get it to shift or my mind to not create all of these real symptoms. I haven't enjoyed life as I think somethings been wrong with me all the years but is it just anxiety doing that? Please help thank you",

I\u2019m a 39F, Caucasian, 5\u20195\u2019 and overweight. \n\nI have had chronic lower back pain for the past 13-14 years and I am not sure if that is causing the weird sensations I\u2019ve had in my legs recently or if it\u2019s maybe something else.\n\nFor the past year, I\u2019ve been experiencing my 3 inner toes on my left foot going numb. It seems to happen randomly and is not brought on by anything specific that I\u2019m doing. Likewise, my hips, butt, and upper thighs have cramping up. It feels as if my thigh muscles just lock up and get stiff. \n\nI\u2019ve been attributing all of that to my normal LBP that I\u2019ve been dealing with all these years, thinking maybe my back issues are getting a little worse, but at the end of June I started feeling something I\u2019ve never felt before. I was walking through my house and suddenly felt as if water was dripping onto the back of my left calf, near the bend of my knee.  It felt extremely cold, bordering on freezing. And it was just a constant drip drip drip feeling as well as a feeling of my calf in that spot being wet. The \u201cwet spot\u201d started out no bigger than a quarter, but the sensation grew over the course of a week and ended up feeling like a puddle on the back of my calf the size of a silver dollar. By the time I got in with my primary, the feeling was gone. \n\nAfter that, I\u2019ve felt more cramping in my legs and calves, but I\u2019ve also felt as if there is a hair or a string across my lower shin. This feeling comes and goes, and it feels like it\u2019s horizontal across my shin, like walking through a trip wire or something. Except the sensation is faint. Like someone loosely taped a string across a door and I walked through it. This is also on my left leg. \n\nHow likely is it that this is just the effects of my regular lower back pain? Or is this maybe something more that should be addressed and evaluated? My pcp ordered all relevant blood tests to rule out things such as diabetes and my labs came back as normal, except for my C-reactive protein level, which was 1.1 mg/dL.",

Currently taking lamotrigine for my epilepsy (general, idiopathic) - for 3 years already\nBut epilepsy started when i was 10 y.o.\nMy meds could have contributed to my sleepiness but even before taking it, i still easily get tired. I even tried dozing off in the middle of an exam. Sometimes sleepy and feels like floating while walking along session road\n\n3. Epilepsy trigerred by painful menstruation (definitely adenomyosis, probably endometriosis too)\nor sleep lower than 6 hrs\n\n4. I sometimes suddenly wake up at night and feel dizzy. My heart also beat so fast. I think that I will have an epileptic attack when i experience this.\n\n5. I have GERD. Experience post nasal drip. Difficulty talking for long periods of time which makes it difficult to teach.\n\n6. Painful legs and feet almost everyday. I like to walk but minimize it cause I have flat foot.\nSometimes my calf just hurts so bad. I also easily get cramps to the extent that I couldn't walk sometimes, even if I just sit down for 30 mins.\nMy back also hurts sometimes to the point that I couldnt wake up.\n\n7. Preliminary assessment is I have ADD (without the H in adhd cause i don't have energy), little bit of OCD, and low spatial intelligence. With this, I have difficulty studying (and so other tasks). It would take me about 20 mins to finish 1 page. It depends with the font, it could even take an hour. In a word (esp those used in science and med), I can only remember the 1st and last syllables. I am also always day-dreaming so I hope I won't be bumped by a car one day because of being absent minded.\n\nI feel that I am too slow when studying or doing tasks in the day time but I can't go on with lack of sleep either.

And I'm flat footed so even if i like taking a walk, i must minimize it. Probably lack of discipline too cause I wake up at 10:00 or 10:30 if i don't have to go to school. I really do my very best to improve my habits but I really can't wake-up.)\n\nMy activities: taking up masters (online only about 5 hours a week), teaching undergrad classes part-time (14 hours a week only) , doing online writing jobs (almost every evening)\n\nHow can I solve these? Though this may sound absurd to some, I am truly experiencing this. I have been to several doctors but I haven't really improved yet.

I would still cough during the day, but mostly intermittently. \n\nMost of the coughing feels relatively dry and surface level, every once in awhile when I clear my throat I\u2019ll feel a little bit of a wetness, but usually not associated with the cough itself.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s important [maybe not] but typically when I wake up and cough I\u2019ll feel almost like a metallic taste at the back of my throat.\n\nLargely isolated to right before bed I\u2019ve also dealt with pretty severe shortness of breath, though coughing generally clears it up for very brief periods of time - I have noticed very mild shortness of breath during the day, but it mostly goes unnoticed.  I also experience some sever wheezing while trying to sleep, which presents in sort of a small mouse like and almost cute noise\n\nI have still been maintaining a jogging routine 2-3 times a week, and I seem unaffected by breathing during these times.\n\n**What have I done about this**\n\nAs we just moved I don\u2019t yet have a GP, and I recognize I do need to find one, I\u2019m hoping to get some insight here beforehand. At the moment I\u2019ve been to urgent care twice:\n\n- The first time the doctor looked at me and determined all of the coughing was coming from my head, and that my oxygen levels were completely normal, there was no sign of issues in my chest or lungs. The belief was that it was entirely environmental from the current air qualities [we live in NJ, but the wildfire related air quality has been relatively normal for weeks].\n  - I was given a nasal spray to take twice a day, as well as Benzonatate. Both of which I took 100% as instructed.\n- A week later I returned to the Urgent Care having had no relief. A different doctor looked more thyroid hot and determined mostly the same thing.\n  - I was given a 5 day course of Prednisone and a 10 day course of Amoxicillin, both of which I took to completion\n\nWe are now at day 11 past that second Urgent Care visit, I would estimate that I felt almost 100% relief for the first 6-7 days while taking these medications.

To the point where I bought a glucose monitor and tested my fasting glucose each morning and when symptoms occurred. \n\nFasting glucose always 70-90 in the morning.\n\nToday I had an episode where my blood glucose was 49 - the lowest it\u2019s ever been. Generally when it dips, it\u2019s between 54-60. \n\nI notice this often happens after even light-moderate exercise (ie; mowing the lawn). Most often if I\u2019ve had a high carb, low fiber meal within the 3-6 hours prior.  \n\nToday I only had one small-medium sized meal of rice and meat at 3pm. I took a nap around 4:30pm and at 6pm I was playing with my baby and running around with her - that\u2019s when it hit me. I checked my sugar and it was 49. I was extremely shaky and felt like my vision was warping in and out. I drank orange juice and within 5 mins my sugar was back to normal. \n\nI\u2019ve tested fasting glucose over a 28 hour period previously (scared of insulinoma) and sugar was normal the whole time. I\u2019ve also tried not drinking any sugar during these episodes once when it was 56 and it went back to normal on its own within 10 mins. I generally don\u2019t do this though as I\u2019m scared it could crash too low and not recover. \n\nI have had some episodes of low blood sugar in the past, even as far back as being a kid I remember the same symptoms happening occasionally.

[26F]\nTL;DR: *\"To Hep B, or not to Hep B?\"* Can any medical professionals here please share their thoughts or insights on this? Should my next steps be to see a hematologist, or should I see a hepatologist?   \n\n\nI try to donate whole blood or plasma whenever possible. Blood donation centers in the U.S. test donations for Hep B antibodies, among many other things. I made successful donations of whole blood, platelets, and plasma from 2014-2019. At the age of 3 months, I received three rounds of Hep B vaccines for full vaccination- so, since my donations for 5 years were successful, clearly the vaccine was doing its job.\n\nIn October 2021, I received a letter following a blood donation that essentially said I was permanently ineligible for donating because of these results:\n\n|Hep B core total antibody  (anti-HBc)|Positive|\n|:-|:-|\n|HBsAG|Negative|\n|Additional HBsAG Neutralization test|Not Tested|\n|HIV-1/HCV/HBV NAT screening test|Negative|\n|HBV NAT|Negative|\n\nThe letter explained *\"These test results may indicate a past HBV infection or a false-positive reaction. There is no FDA-approved confirmatory test available, so we cannot determine which of these situations applies to you...*\n\nIf it's worth noting, in the gap from the successful donation in 2019 through the flagged result in 2021, I had no new sexual partners and had no accidental needle sticks (I work in EMS)**.\\*\\*\\*** Since I was vaccinated as an infant and I thought this was a vaccine that \"lasts for life,\" I assumed the result was a false positive and went a few weeks later to donate at a different blood center organization (they don't share donor info across organizations, so nobody was the wiser).\n\nThis second blood center flagged:\n\n|Hepatitis B core total antibodies IGg and IGm|Positive|\n|:-|:-|\n|HBsAG|Negative|\n|HBV NAT|Negative|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I went and had a blood panel done by my GYN, for which the results were:\n\n|HBsAG|Nonreactive|\n|:-|:-|\n|HBsAB|Reactive|\n|HBs antibody R|Reactive|\n|HBs antibody S|Indeterminate|\n|HBs antibody S, quantitative|7.2 mIU/mL|\n\nAnd based on this, my provider said my antibodies were teetering or something like that, and instructed me to get vaccinated again.\n\nSo, from the end of 2021 through mid-2022, I did the three vaccinations to be fully vaccinated against Hep B. Assuming that this would solve my problem of having weird blood results in my blood donations, I went last month to donate plasma. I was flagged again!\n\n|Hepatitis B core total antibodies IGg and IGm|Positive|\n|:-|:-|\n|HBsAG|Negative|\n|HBV NAT|Negative|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe way I'm seeing this is either\n\n1. I have an underlying thing (ie. auto-immune disease) causing these unexpected test results\n2. I had 3 or 4 false positives in a row (what are the odds?)\n3. I had the unfortunate luck of my vaccine wearing off after \\~21-22 years of getting it as an infant, and somehow, when I wasn't sexually active or exposed to any needle sticks, I got infected with Hep B.\n\n**Can any medical professionals here please share their thoughts or insights on this?

        "context": "Frequent nasal infections and immune system problems, not taken seriously by doctors\nI'm 32F, white, 5' 4\", 180lbs, having concerns about my immune system.\n\nKnown conditions: C-PTSD, autism, ADHD, HPV, HSV-1, lactose intolerance, suspected IBS-D, history of Reactive Arthritis, history of benign ovarian and breast cysts.\n\nMedicines used: nothing but microdosing psilocybin to treat PTSD (started recently)\n\n\n\nThere are quite a few things going on and I'm not sure what all is connected and what is unrelated, so I'll try explaining it all the best I can. It's long, but I'm desperate and I don't want to miss anything. I'd be grateful if I could get some insight and pointers what specialists to see and what investigations to request.\n\nIn summer 2020 I gave birth to my first child. Unfortunately, this childbirth was very traumatic as I experienced obstetric violence and had a near-death experience during delivery. As a result I now have C-PTSD.\n\nIn winter 2020 I got a severe sinus infection. I think this was the first sinus infection I ever had in my life. Very quickly, on top of sinus pains and massive amounts of green-yellow puss coming from my nose, I started having extreme flu-like body pains. It was sharp pain that's hard to describe for how insanely intense it was. I had no fever, yet I constantly felt like the most violent fever was shaking me and tearing my body apart. Like all my limbs were infected and butchered. It felt like it's both muscle and bone pain and it was predominantly in long bones of arms and legs.\n\nAt that pandemic time GPs weren't seeing anyone face to face and I was repeatedly dismissed over the phone. The only thing they did was to give me a saline nasal rinse! I couldn't get rid of this horrendous infection for about 2 months. I was pretty much non functional all that time, spending all my time sitting on the sofa shaking and crying in pain, unable to take care of my baby. I developed extreme brain fog, to the point I couldn't read a newspaper article or do simple sums (this now improved slightly, but not completely). After being dismissed several times, I stopped trying and sank into depression out of desperation of being invisible, just surviving day to day. I had neither strength nor mental capacity to stand up for myself because at that point, I was in an extremely dark place due to PTSD, probably a step away from suicidal. I was regularly waking up screaming and crying from nightmares about my baby being killed and mutilated. Doctors downplayed everything, my sinus infection was \"a bit of an infection, rinsing will help\", my PTSD was \"a little bit of postpartum anxiety\" (it took doctors over 2 years to start taking it seriously), my body pains were \"all in my head due to anxiety, I should take some antidepressants and the pains will stop\".\n\nSo I spent around 2 months as a zombie. Eventually the infection was gone - however something has changed in my body. Ever since that infection I haven't been the same. My health is ruined, my immune system feels *extremely overactive*. It's been 2.5 years and  my longest stretch of feeling normal and healthy was maybe a couple of days. I pretty much constantly live with flu-like symptoms. Body pains are now not as bad as they were during that first occurrence, but they're still here. I'd say I have episodes of bone/muscle pains and brain fog. These flare ups can be anything from a week apart to 1-2 months apart, but they always come back. If my husband or children are in any way sick, even if it's just a very slight cold, my immune system instantly picks up on it and intense body pains start. When I have something more serious, like when I had Covid (spring 2021, at 20 weeks pregnant) it also instantly results in feeling like my bones and muscles are infected. During Covid my hip was on fire for days, I wanted to scream!\n\nAs for the sinus infection itself, they also come back frequently, I'd say every 2-3 months. They instantly trigger my neck lymph nodes and I can easily have painful glands for good 2-3 weeks. I have random shooting pains in sinuses even when there's no infection (both in frontal, ethmoid and maxillary ones). All these numerous sinus infections significantly worsened my already existing postnasal drip - it sounds a bit shocking, but I've been having postnatal drip ever since I removed my tonsils in 2009! I now have to use steroid nose drops pretty much daily to reduce the amount of drip.\n\nIn recent months something else started happening on top of sinus infections and body pains. I started getting frequent infections in my nostrils. The moment I start feeling the beginning of it in a nostril, lymph nodes start hurting. I don't feel they're really swollen, just painful. These nostril infections alone can cause 2-3 weeks of painful glands. Sinus infections and nostril infections often come together.\n\nMy first nostril infection happened in winter 2021 when I was 6 weeks pregnant with my second, together with a sinus infection. This involved entire vestibules of both nostrils being infected. After a few days of increasing pain, the edge of one nostril developed cellulitis. GP saw this as an infection first caused by a virus, with a secondary bacterial infection. The cellulitis was treated with a combination of antiviral cream and several weeks of antibiotics (flucloxacilin). Then there was silence for a while during pregnancy, but after childbirth everything came back.\n\nThis spring out of nowhere I had my first herpes infection on lips. I had no idea herpes can be that big and last that long! It lasted 4 weeks, I had 4 massive blisters that left scars, and the infection triggered my neck glands again. I felt like I was dying for weeks.\n\nNasal infections are now happening so often I stopped calling doctors about it, I just use the leftover neomicin or mupirocin I have from a previous infection because I call the GP about my pains and infections so often, I can feel the eyes rolling. I fear they started seeing me as a hypochondriac. I'm NOT a hypochondriac, I live in serious pain for the last 2.5 years, I'm constantly sick, and all of it is affecting my quality of life. I stopped working because of body pains and brain fog, my job was my passion and the loss of it really affects me mentally. I worry about how to take care of my children. All this pain + PTSD is causing a horrible health anxiety. I don't feel it's normal to constantly have some sort of infection, have painful glands and have bone and muscle pains.\n\nI have a nasal infection right now, I don't know whether it's the same thing as before or is it a herpes infection this time?! I got flucloxacilin tablets and mupirocin cream for it. The GP hasn't swabbed it or anything, they just love handing out antibiotics over here... My glands are painful once again.\n\nOne of several GPs I talked to took me half seriously and thought my pains are Fibromyalgia triggered by PTSD and/or Arthritis. He considered a possibility of seronegative Rheumatoid Arthritis because my immune system seems to be triggered so much, but my RF and CCP are negative. He gave me a referral to see a Rheumatologist because of my history (still waiting for the appointment!), which is Poststreptococcal Reactive Arthritis at the age of 17. At that time, I was fighting RA for almost one year before doctors started believing me, it got to the point where I fell onto the floor during training, unable to move from pain in my ankles and wrists. My antistreptolysin O titre (ASO) was around 1200 IU/ml and X-rays taken at that time showed reduced mineralisation of my left wrist (I have to point out my mother, grandmother and aunt all had osteopenia!), but doctors weren't concerned I'll have any further issues with Arthritis. Guess they were wrong... The GP thinks my Reactive Arthritis is not back, he last checked my ASO in 2021 and it came back as 400. I'm not sure I'm convinced tbh. I never got a referral for an ENT because my sinus infections weren't taken seriously, which I think is wrong.\n\nAnother thing I have to point out that speaks in favour of something being wrong with my immune system is that I have HPV that my body seems to be unable to clear. Every smear and colposcopy has been positive since 2019. When I mentioned all of my other troubles to my colposcopist, she encouraged me to investigate further whether something is wrong with my immune system. Thankfully the HPV didn't progress to CIN1, all this time I only had borderline changes. I had cold coagulation earlier this month.\n\nThis is it. Thank you if you were willing to read this far. If anyone has any idea what is going on here please share and tell me where do I go from here, what tests and what specialists do I need.\n\nThank you",

The dentist ruled out a dental cause and suggested seeing an ENT. They found an osteoma in the site of pain but claim it can't cause facial pain, yet all the studies I read say it can.\n\nI'm 26m, white, 5ft 10, social smoker/light drinker, UK, tried gabapentinoids to no avail.  \nI had a scan done and the ENT said there was \u2018white\u2019 on the region of the scan and he didn\u2019t know what it was. So he referred me to another ENT department he thought could help.  \nThey couldn\u2019t access his scan and to my recollection they ordered another one. They told me that they found an osteoma at the exact location of my pain, however they don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for an osteoma to cause facial pain. So they referred me to a pain clinic who said it was \u2018idiopathic facial pain\u2019 and probably neurological in origin. They said my best bet was seeing a \u2018pain psychologist\u2019 and taking nerve pain medication (which hasn\u2019t helped at all).  \nI felt I wanted a second opinion on the osteoma and the pain, and finally got seen again by the ENT. They stated they couldn\u2019t access either of my scans, and had no record of the second scan and that it probably \u2018didn\u2019t happen\u2019 (it did). Nonetheless, he still was adamant that the osteoma couldn\u2019t cause facial pain and that pain psychology was the only treatment.  \nNow, every study I have read states that sinus osteomas can and often do cause facial pain.  \n\u2018The most common symptom of paranasal osteomas is pain including headache and facial pain (Atallah and Jay, 1981).\u2019 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319453411001044#:\\~:text=The%20clinical%20presentation%20of%20paranasal,Atallah%20and%20Jay%2C%201981).  \nIt seems bizarre to me that there would be an osteoma at the exact location of the pain that\u2019s unrelated. What\u2019s even more bizarre to me is being told it can\u2019t cause facial pain when every study says it does.  \nNow I\u2019m not certain this is the cause of the pain. However it confused me. Furthermore, I am not happy with the idiopathic/nerve diagnosis. They arrived at that from simply not finding another cause, and it really doesn\u2019t feel like a nerve problem to me (it feels very structural/physical, largely affected by pressure, I can feel/hear liquid/fluid opening closing etc).  \nThey have stated they are going to try and locate the past scan, however that was from 4 years ago. I will pursue a new scan, but i am not convinced of whether the response will be any better.  \nAny thoughts or advice would be useful!  \nThanks",

Should my next steps be to see a hematologist, or should I see a hepatologist?   \n\n\nI try to donate whole blood or plasma whenever possible. Blood donation centers in the U.S. test donations for Hep B antibodies, among many other things. I made successful donations of whole blood, platelets, and plasma from 2014-2019. At the age of 3 months, I received three rounds of Hep B vaccines for full vaccination- so, since my donations for 5 years were successful, clearly the vaccine was doing its job.\n\nIn October 2021, I received a letter following a blood donation that essentially said I was permanently ineligible for donating because of these results:\n\n|Hep B core total antibody  (anti-HBc)|Positive|\n|:-|:-|\n|HBsAG|Negative|\n|Additional HBsAG Neutralization test|Not Tested|\n|HIV-1/HCV/HBV NAT screening test|Negative|\n|HBV NAT|Negative|\n\nThe letter explained *\"These test results may indicate a past HBV infection or a false-positive reaction. There is no FDA-approved confirmatory test available, so we cannot determine which of these situations applies to you...*\n\nIf it's worth noting, in the gap from the successful donation in 2019 through the flagged result in 2021, I had no new sexual partners and had no accidental needle sticks (I work in EMS)**.\\*\\*\\*** Since I was vaccinated as an infant and I thought this was a vaccine that \"lasts for life,\" I assumed the result was a false positive and went a few weeks later to donate at a different blood center organization (they don't share donor info across organizations, so nobody was the wiser).\n\nThis second blood center flagged:\n\n|Hepatitis B core total antibodies IGg and IGm|Positive|\n|:-|:-|\n|HBsAG|Negative|\n|HBV NAT|Negative|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I went and had a blood panel done by my GYN, for which the results were:\n\n|HBsAG|Nonreactive|\n|:-|:-|\n|HBsAB|Reactive|\n|HBs antibody R|Reactive|\n|HBs antibody S|Indeterminate|\n|HBs antibody S, quantitative|7.2 mIU/mL|\n\nAnd based on this, my provider said my antibodies were teetering or something like that, and instructed me to get vaccinated again.\n\nSo, from the end of 2021 through mid-2022, I did the three vaccinations to be fully vaccinated against Hep B. Assuming that this would solve my problem of having weird blood results in my blood donations, I went last month to donate plasma.

I struggled with constipation and feeling like I was never finished when I went to the bathroom. I had mucus in stool and on the rare occasion that I would get pain from constipation lasting too long,  I would have these brief fainting spells or just feel really dizzy.\n\nMoving forward to now I've been suffering from stomach pain since the start of this year in my lower abdomen around my belly button and pelvis- mainly situated in the center and left side, constantly going back and forth between constipation and diarrhea, with nothing subsiding the pain aside from eating which slightly lessened it until I hurt even worse at night. Between the pain and the fatigue it brought with it, I've been unable to carry on with my usual activities and mostly find myself lying in pain for most of the day. I first went to my PCP who sent out abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds, as well as blood tests testing for celiac, all of which came back normal.\n\nUpon following up with my GI doctor I did a colonoscopy, in which I was unable to properly do the prep as the solution made me nauseous and so some areas were not clear. He told me however that my results were normal aside from some small hemorrhoids. I later did a H. Pylori breath test, as my dad had gotten it around this time, which came back negative. I recently did an endoscopy where a biopsy was sent which was found to be normal aside from mild gastritis, which brings me here.\n\nAside from potentially repeating the colonoscopy or doing a CT scan- which terrifies me because of the radiation- I don't know where to turn next, and hate that there almost seems to be no root cause to my symptoms. Has anyone else experienced anything similar, or potentially know what condition this may sound similar to? Could it really just be IBS? I'm so exhausted.",

If I remember the numbers correctly, he said that almost all of my events are CSA with a few OSA events and I have an average of 94 events per hour and my brain wakes up an average of 68 times per hour. During the appointment he asked me if I had any history or had been seen for MS, ALS or Parkinson\u2019s before. I\u2019m only 28 so of course I haven\u2019t. He said that central sleep apnea is very rare (compared to OSA), and that almost everyone who has CSA also has an underlying condition of MS, ALS, or Parkinson\u2019s.

Like every other guy with this issue it's made it historically impossible for me to engage in relationships with women. I don't hate women. I have always acknowledged that I am the problem in this equation. \n\nI'm from a poor, ghetto neighborhood in a poor, ghetto city. My father (65m) abandoned us before I can remember. My older brother (29 now, m) was a notorious womanizer and known gang banger, currently serving 20yrs for his involvement in a murder. When i was 17 and he was 20, his gf (~20 f) at the time along with my older sister (23 f then) hired a mutual \"friend\" of theirs (who I do not know outside of this incident) to take my virginity. For $50. This was a 15 year old girl who already had a child (2 things I did not know at the time of the event). \n\nShe came over. My sister and my brothers gf let her in and led her to my room, they then waited downstairs for us to do what she had been paid to do. We had sex except I couldn't finish. I'm not sure how long we actually went on for but at some point I just pretended to finish so that it could be over. I don't remember feeling traumatized at the time. I just remember the girls reaction. As far as i could tell based on what she said and the way her body reacted, i thought she enjoyed it. I remember her offering to see me again free of charge. I feel disgusting writing that. I don't say that to imply that all sex workers or those who are trafficked enjoy what is done to them, or that I'm some whiz in the bedroom.  This was almost a decade ago, she may very well have been faking it and the memory formed as it did due to naivete. But in my memory she genuinely enjoyed it. \n\nThe feelings this left me with were mixed and I certainly wasn't aware at the time of the trauma that was being inflicted on both of our young minds. I remember a mix of shame and pride. Shame at my inability to \"get\" a girl ( sexist terminology, girls are not property, but thats how i was brought up to speak about it) and simultaneous pride at my apparent \"skills\" despite my lack of experience. I was happy to have lost my virginity.\n\nAt this point in my life I understand the violence, depravity and trauma that the \"industry\" is rife with and I want no further part of it. This girl wasn't a sex worker. She was 15 year old girl who was being trafficked by people I was close to. I'm not sure either of us had conscious awareness of it at the time. In hindsight this damaged my view of women and relationships even further. \n\nIn my head from that point on, that was a normal thing. It was what guys did, especially if they had money. I convinced myself of that. I listened to the media and people around me. \"It ain't tricking if you got it\". \"What's the difference between that and paying for everything in a relationship\" so on and so forth. As a 26 year old man I hear how pathetic and disgusting those sentiments are, but it's something I've only really understood disturbingly recently. \n\nI've had consensual sexual relationships between then and now, although few. None for more than several months. But I've continued to use escorts since then. I remember being around 20 and being addicted to it. I saw as many women as I could in one night. Eventually I stopped this because of purely financial reasons, that was totally unsustainable for a broke college kid. Then I graduated, moved away and started my career. Older now, but no wiser I moved to a new city and began the habit again. Off and on this time as I battled the shame. A shame that I never really was able to understand or reconcile. Until today. I guess I've probably understood it for longer, but today, as a write this, crystallizing the thoughts, I can only just now be certain. \n\nIt's been a few months since I've done it. I decided to go to therapy for my social anxiety. Turns out my first sexual experience wasn't the only childhood trauma I wasn't aware of. The same sister who helped set up that encounter was also the reason I felt I needed it. Her verbal abuse in our youth had convinced me that I was unattractive to my core. I was fat, ugly, and stupid. That was me. And no one would ever want someone like me. \n\nSince having this breakthrough, approaching women has become a lot easier. I AM a physically attractive man, I can finally say that I see that about myself, but I still struggle with romance, as is to be expected from someone essentially getting started at my age. Thankfully, I do actually have decent in person social skills. I suck over text. I'm pretty sure I come off as clingy or desperate or maybe boring or all of the above. I'm not sure when to start or end a conversation over text. I think I overshare. Whatever. Stuff I can work on. Like I said, I know that I'm the problem here and have to continue to work on myself. \n\nAll that said, I've been putting myself out there and introducing myself to women in social situations, and I've even gotten a few phone numbers in person over the past few weeks. I've been ghosted by 2 of them and been told by the third that she's just interested in being friends. I'll be honest and say in the moment of being ghosted by the last I woman I got angry. Partially because of being ghosted before the date we had set up that night but partially because I was already having an awful day when the cherry on top was getting ghosted and stood up. I had driven across the state to visit my brother in prison but had lost my ID and was rightfully turned away because of it. I then had to drive to a totally separate state because of work (I travel for work) only to get to my prebooked hotel and remember that I don't have an ID. No refund, of course. I threw my phone out of frustration after being hung up on by the customer service AI, which bounced off my dash and cracked my car window. Ended up paying out the ass for an airbnb. I was genuinely having a bad day. (And I hired a new therapist for anger management today) I am not angry at her. In hindsight, I definitely see the red flags I gave her. I can't reiterate enough that at the end of the day, I know I'm the one with the problem here.\n\nToday is the day after. I'm sitting here in a strip mall parking lot across from a cheap motel where there is an escort who expected me to show up 30 mins ago. I decided against it at the last moment. I started thinking about a future partner and what she might say. Then about the fact that one can never truly know the circumstances that drove a person to sex work and that i cannot allow myself to contribute to this kind of exploitation anymore. Then i started googling and reading and finally writing this post. I can't do this anymore. Not with everything I know as an adult. I'm ashamed it took me so long to realize why I shouldn't do it, but I finally have. \n\n\nI guess my question for you, assuming you make it this far is, do I even have a chance of ever being healthy and finding love? In your opinion? I guess I'm asking myself as much as I'm asking everyone else. After reliving all of this, do I feel like I deserve a chance with any well adjusted woman? I honestly don't know. But I can't keep doing this. That's for certain.",

I have been under severe unexplained circumstances for like 4 years now. \n\n**A quick historical background**\n\nI have always had a troubled childhood. A madman for a father who was almost wrestling with us all, most of the time. He was so violent domestically that I used to pray for his death, not gonna lie. Abandoned us when I was like 15. On top of that, when my mother could have been my go-to person, she always found ways to further ridicule me, torture me, and made me question my existence. I have 2 sisters and 3 brothers apart from me and the thing is, genetically all of them are more like my mom (fair-complexioned), and only I am the one genetically close to my dad (brown-complexioned). \n\nMaybe she saw my dad in me. I used to scrub my skin for hours and hurt myself just because my mom thought I didn\u2019t look as fair as others. To keep it short, it was a disastrous upbringing. My elder brothers used to hit me so bad when I was at max 8-10 and I don\u2019t claim to be Jesus, but what wrong could a 10-year-old possibly do? My mom used to hit me whenever she got the chance. \n\nTo keep it short, I have spent the first 18-20 years of my life worrying about things, being anxious all the time, in fight or flight mode, and questioning how I looked. In no way was I a failure as a kid. I was totally obedient, more than I should have been, ideally. I was exceedingly good at academics and got distinctions all my studying years. I was really good at sports. I won declamation contests in my childhood in my region with all that was happening around me. The only point I am trying to make here is that I was a very good child checking almost all the boxes.\n\n**The albuterol incident**\n\nNow I was never bothered much by whatever was happening around me until one day I had this huge huge overdose of Albuterol when I was trying to treat my asthma but filled the whole nebulizer chamber with the drug instead of mixing it up. So it must have been a stupidly high dose ranging up to 20 mg and that is a killer dose. Ideally, all the side effects should have vanished in around 5-6 hours. The effects included severe severe high BP, severe palpitations, severe heart pain, and vertigo and I felt like dying in short. \n\nHowever, the symptoms never actually went away. I started losing weight very quickly and went from 72 kg to 54 in a couple of months. Severe GERD came in, severe diarrhea, bloating, and a lot happening to my heart. I couldn\u2019t make sense of anything. I was having sleepless nights. Very rarely did I sleep those days. I started having blurry and kind of disturbed vision. \n\n**Situation now**\n\nTo this day, I have gone to several doctors including gastroentrologists and cardiologists and upon several visits nothing could be found out. \n\nThe cardiologists have cleared me on my ECGs, EKGs, cardiac ultrasound, CT angiography, 24-hour Holter monitor, Exercise Tolerance Test (though it said borderline positive for Ischemia). My blood sugar level tests, potassium level tests, thyroid level tests and even Renal Functions Tests have been examined but nothing was found.\n\nThe thing is, I have severe symptoms(which I will explain more later), which I seriously think are because of the Albuterol overdose becaue everything went downhill from there and I had nothing physically hurting me before that.   \n\nUpon my last visit to my cardiologist, he aslo consulted another general physician and they both told me that I was dealing with FIBROMYALGIA and that Albuterol event only played a trigger for everything that came in afterwards. \n\nI will start mentioning whatever symptoms I have and you people please help me find out if I really have it or not.\n\nFatigue: I have severe fatigue syndrome. I do not remember the last time I felt fresh. Probably 4 years ago. I am almost always severely drained out. I do not feel like doing things I once enjoyed. Not just I don\u2019t feel like doing them, I have zero energy to do them. It feels like I do not have an ounce of will to do things.\n\nHigh BP: My BP has been recorded touching 160/90 at multiple occurrences on different doctor\u2019s visits. Maybe some of it is due to the anxiety I have while visiting a doctor. But I know it for a fact that I am dealing with high BP. I have constant pressure in my head and sometime it feels like I will fall down due to eqarthquake-y feeling as BP seems to be touching high numbers.\n\nConstant headaches: Now the headaches might be due to high BP obviously but I have these constant headaches. Like something has been placed on my head for so so long.\n\nStiff muscles: My body always feels like its is imploding inwards. Everything feels so tight and not in rest. Like generally, it feels like tightening up. \n\nGeneral body pain: Apart from fatigue and everything, my body really hurts all over. I can never point out where the pain is but it just hurts. Especially my limbs (thighs even more)  hurt a lot. \n\nUnexplained dry, hardened and tingling lips: I drink a lot of water during the day but after the Albuterol incident, my lips are always dry and hard.\n\nSevere loss of libido: Before the incident, I did have a very high libido. Now I have zero. I'm not proud of it but it was very hard to control my libido and I've fapped 3, 4 times a day. But after the overdose, I hardly feel like doing it. Been months I felt the need to, tbh.\n\nNeedling in my limbs whenever I sit on ground for long: Whenever I rest my limbs under some pressure for some time, they start needling. Sometimes it's so bad that i can't stand. It's like my legs will sometimes go on a sleep and I won't be able to stand.\n\nChest pain and all cardiac symptoms: My chest at the left side hurts a lot. I have severe palpitations that I can feel all over my body. Like I can feel my heart in my legs and stomach. BP soares to unbearable numbers. \n\nGERD and stomach problems: The GERD was very bad a couple years ago and not that bad now. But I normally feel indigestion and never have a very good feeling after I eat.\n\nEarthquake-y feeling: My hunch is I feel it when I have BP rising high but whatever it is, it is horrifying. I feel vertigo and an earthquake-y feeling for several minutes multiple times a day. \n\nWeight loss: Although I have a good weight of around 67kgs (I am 5 feet 7) but I feel like losing my weight. I feel so weak at times that it seems like I am underweight by a margin. \n\nI have been dealing with all this shit for 4 years now and I have multiple times thought about ending it up once and for all. However, I somehow kept going I have no idea why. Please help me out a bit.",

Turns out that all of my issues I had during pregnancy, the cause of my son\u2019s stillbirth, and my chest pain and dizziness were all a result of Rheumatic Heart Disease.\n\nI ended up having a stroke and I thought that would change my urgency of care, but still I was dismissed by all of my providers. My cardiologist was very condescending and said my issues, specifically worsening issues, such as extreme chest pain, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, feeling a cold fluid feeling in my chest, my swollen abdomen and feet, and a hard cough, were just the result of stress and anxiety. I asked for an updated echocardiogram since I had one last year and much has change with my symptoms. I was denied and said an echo was absolutely not needed in my case. \n\nI went to my primary care who was also condescending and said it was anxiety. At the point of anger and tears I told her I felt like I\u2019m dying and I needed help. She said she was not a cardiologist but if it would help me feel better she would order an echocardiogram at the local hospital. \n\nMonday I had the echo. Wednesday I was diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease affecting both the mitral and tricuspid valves. There is still no urgency from my care team. I\u2019m being ignored by my PCP. My cardiologist gave a half-hearted \u201cwe\u2019ll request the echo records\u201d when I called them. I feel even worse. My chest pain now only ends when I feel a burst of fluid that feels like it fills my chest and neck. I\u2019m having trouble breathing all the time. But if I have a feeling if I traveled to the ER again, I\u2019d be dismissed right away just like I was before in pregnancy and earlier postpartum. I\u2019ve had this chest pain for months and especially when I was pregnant but for all the 6 times I went to Labor and Delivery I was discharged right away and never given an EKG or any cardiac work up. Same with my OB. \n\nSeparately, I\u2019m seeing a neurologist for my TIA. He\u2019s found something doing an EEG and multiple MRIs. He won\u2019t tell me the results until my follow up on 2 weeks but told me I absolutely cannot work or drive. \n\nI\u2019m truly at a loss of what to do. If I call the office I get attitude from both the nurses and receptionists. I can\u2019t even find good information on this disease because it seems like it\u2019s not common in developed countries. I live in the US, I\u2019m upper-middle class, I have always taken my full course of antibiotics when I\u2019ve had strep. I just don\u2019t understand how of the thousands and thousands of dollars I\u2019ve spent trying to get help over the past few months all I have to show for it is a permanent heart condition, a dead child, and no plan moving forward.",

(May 2022.) \n\n\\* Stepped on Rusty nail in filthiest shoes possible. Photo link below.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/vjtk4e8\n\nI am a teacher and I also enjoy woodworking. I am building a 'Buddy Bench' for our elementary school playground, and we have also been DIY renovating our home this entire summer. I managed to step on an extremely rusty nail that had been outside for weeks. This happened two days ago (on Wednesday.) I was changing the bit on my trim router without gloves (brilliant, I know) and then I clipped the side of my hand and started to bleed. I leaned over to grab a paper towel, tripped, hit the side of my house, bounced off of the siding, ran into the deck railing, and then somehow flipped over my bin of scrap wood/trim and dumped it all over and then landed straight on top of a piece of shoe molding with nails sticking straight up. I jammed my foot down pretty hard/suddenly and the nail blew straight through the sole of my garden boots and punctured a little more than 1/4 inch into my foot. It was enough to cause pretty sharp pain and I did have very minor bleeding. \n\nI went straight upstairs to my bathroom and my husband, who is on peritoneal dialysis here at home, grabbed a ton of his supplies and I immediately: \n\n1.) Washed my hands, put on gloves, and then washed the puncture wound with Hibiclens for about 2-3 minutes (we used a piece of gauze for this.) I let it sit for another minute and then rinsed it off. \n\n2.) New gloves, and then I opened a pair of surgical tweezers from a package and used these to remove a chunk of the sole of my boot from the wound. \n\n3.) Washed the wound again with Hibiclens. \n\n4.) Soaked gauze in the debriding/antimicrobial liquid called 'Except' that he uses to clean his exit site for his PD catheter. I let this sit on my foot for the suggested two minutes. \n\n5.) I applied his Gentamicin ointment to my foot and then covered with a silver alginate dressing and then closed it up with one of his island bandages. I put a new, clean sock on it and then went to urgent care pronto because I believe my last Tetanus shot was in 2013...I just wasn't sure and didn't want to take any chances at all. \n\nI let the P.A at the Urgent Care have a look and he said it definitely got me, but it sounded like I did a solid job cleaning it up initially. He didn't see any more shoe bits inside and put a clean bandage on it for me and then definitely agreed that I needed a tetanus booster, so we got that done and I left. \n\nHe didn't believe I needed any preventative antibiotics at that time but did tell me that if I noticed any signs of infection, increased pain, drainage, fever, etc...to come back immediately. \n\nVaccines can obviously cause you to feel gross for a day or two, and I started feeling like absolute crap last night. Body aches, fatigue, and a very, very sore foot, calf, thigh, and hip. I figured this is from limping/overcompensating and my muscles just hurt. It hurts to ball my foot up or move it much. \n\nMy question is this: Does this sound normal for this situation and is not giving a prophylactic antibiotic the right choice for me? I think the wound looks pretty good, but I'm not a medical professional so I don't trust my own assessment LOL.  I've been keeping it super clean and covered. I'm just worried about possible infection. I don't want/mean to be paranoid, I just don't want to develop any complications. As mentioned above...my husband already has ongoing health problems. We have two young children AND I'm a new teacher that's about to start back to work in two weeks. I do NOT want or need any problems that could have been prevented.\n\nThe P.A was a great guy and I trust him for the most part, I just wanted to see what someone else has to say about it. In the grand scheme of things, this isn't a very severe nail puncture wound, but what bothers me most is the pair of boots I had on. They are absolutely filthy and I have cleaned loads of cat litter, black mold, toilets, garages, been to the landfill repeatedly, and the list goes on. The thought of a chunk of the sole of those nasty things going into my foot (along with a rusty nail) just gives me the creeps :/ \n\nAs long as the wound looks OK and I am up to date on my Tetanus shot, I should be fine to just watch and wait, right? Please ease my mind. \n\n&#x200B;",

        "context": "Periodic inguinal lymph node swelling during pregnancy\nI\u2019m a 32F, generally very healthy, currently am 11 weeks 5 days pregnant with my first child.\n\nSo this actually started about a month before getting pregnant, so this past April. It was my first cycle off of my BC (Annovera) as we intended to start TTC for the first time the next month. I had a lot of fullness and and pain in my lower abdomen, like a combination of period pain and the type of pain from having a very full bladder, going on for about a week. I was also urinating very frequently. I was getting to the point of thinking I should make a doctors appointment (I recently moved and don\u2019t have PC doc in my area yet, which is why I didn\u2019t go sooner).  My thought was possibly I had a UTI, although it didn\u2019t particularly burn when peeing or anything like that.\n\nSo after about a week of this I was out shopping when I randomly went to rub the area that was hurting, and I felt a pretty prominent lump in my left groin area that definitely wasn\u2019t there before. Shortly after I got light headed and started to loose vision, and I had to sit down in the middle of the store (though I didn\u2019t totally loose consciousness). I believe that this was a vagal response (I\u2019ve had them before) probably to freaking myself out by feeling the lump and not passing out directly related to my condition, but obviously I can\u2019t be sure. \n\nSo I recovered from that spell and when I examined the lump some more at home, it seemed pretty obvious it was an inflamed inguinal lymph node. It was moveable and tender. The pain was pretty bad that night and the lymph node still swollen in the AM, so I went to urgent care. The doc there agreed I was feeling a lymph node and that it didn\u2019t seem particularly suspicious for anything like cancer, she examined me to look for any cuts or rashes on my body that might be causing an immune response and found nothing, so agreed it could be a UTI. She sent me home with antibiotics and sent my urine to the lab. I took the antibiotics and by the end of the course the swelling was mostly gone. The urine test came back negative, but I figured since the antibiotics helped it was likely some sort of infection somewhere causing the swelling. I also got my period a few days after the swelling started and my pain resolved after that.\n\nFast forward about a month and I got my positive pregnancy test. I had some bloating and soreness in my lower abdomen that my doc said was typical for early pregnancy, and again had urinary frequency but again, typical for pregnancy. The pain was no where near as bad as the episode a month before. A few weeks after the positive test I noticed my lymph node had swollen again. I did have some bug bites on my leg though on the same side as the lymph node so thought maybe that triggered it this time? It lasted  for a few days before the node felt normal again. The pregnancy has been normal aside for some very light spotting during the 6th week, but my blood work and US came back normal and right on track for where I am in pregnancy. \n\nHowever I am still concerned bc after the bug bites totally cleared, I noticed my lymph node still periodically became swollen and tender, with no apparent cause. It will only last for a day to a few days, then go down, sometimes going from very swollen completely normal overnight. I have noticed that taking Tylenol helps the swelling go away quickly. I mentioned this to my OB after the first time it got swollen in pregnancy, and she said she had no idea what it could be, but if it came back she could refer me to have it examined with ultrasound. But when it came back next, it was gone before I even got a chance to speak with her. The same thing happens every time, it doesn\u2019t stay swollen long enough to have it examined, but it makes me worry every time. What could this be? Could it be my body having a weird pregnancy reaction? If so, why did it first happen before pregnancy?\n\nIn terms of my medical history I had exercise-induced asthma as a kid and have OCD and anxiety (treated with Zoloft). No other chronic medical conditions. I had a CBC as well as infectious disease panel and urinalysis about three weeks ago at my OB and all was normal.",

We have chosen not to become legally married but consider ourselves in a domestic partnership (I mention this to note that while i consider him my husband and am dedicated to him as such, I don\u2019t have the legal rights a legal spouse might have).\n\nBackground details about him: He is white (non-Hispanic) and we live in the USA. He is a 37-year-old cisgender man. He has had long-standing mental health problems (mostly extreme anxiety) since getting sepsis at age 14 which he barely survived. He used to be a heavy drinker before we got together but rarely drinks now. He also used to smoke cigarettes (about 8 a day) and marijuana, but for the past month has cut back on both considerably. He drinks about one energy drink w caffeine daily. He doesn\u2019t do any other recreational drugs. He is prescribed vyvanse, gabapentin, and viibryd for daily use and he *says* he\u2019s been taking them, but I strongly suspect based on the pills he has on hand and his behavior that he hasn\u2019t been for probably 1.5-2 months. He also was prescribed Xanax for occasional panic attacks (so not for daily use) but I don\u2019t think he has taken any in probably 2+ months. He hasn\u2019t seen his psychiatrist in months either. The past year or so was an extremely stressful year for him at work, with the worst occurring about mid-spring of this year, and it was definitely rough for him considering his mental health problems. \n\nCurrent problem: for the past two months he has been declining in every way. He hasn\u2019t showered in at least a month and will only occasionally use bathing wipes I bought for him. He stopped going to work and won\u2019t get a job. He lost his phone for several weeks and had no interest in finding it, so he had to get a new one. He doesn\u2019t spend any time with me and was incredibly rude to his family when they visited last week. He sleeps a lot and spends much of his waking hours in a daze. But most concerningly, he\u2019s become increasingly difficult to converse with. Half of what he says doesn\u2019t make any sense or is filled with non-sequiters. When we went out to eat with his family, he couldn\u2019t even order for himself because he was in a daze. He makes strange jokes and doesn\u2019t remotely understand why me and his parents are concerned. Nor does he understand why he lost his job or why finding a job would be important. We have begged him to see a doctor and he won\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d need to. My husband used to be an extremely hard-worker, always kept up to date on cleaning the house, showered daily, and was very intelligent. We loved watching movies together and playing board games. Now he\u2019s a completely different person and I miss him so much.\n\nHis parents live in another state and the only reason they came here this past week was because I told them I was becoming very concerned. When they visited they agreed that something is wrong, and as the visit progressed they started to suspect, as I do, that despite my partner\u2019s mental health history, this may be something more than a psychiatric problem. It is genuinely hard to describe unless you interact with him, but to us his behavior may indicate something is neurologically, or possibly hormonally, wrong beyond mental illness.\n\nI have reached a point where I have no idea what to do. I have been googling advice and everything tells me either 1) do nothing bc he can make his own decisions, even though I don\u2019t think he\u2019s mentally well enough to do so, or 2) have him admitted to a psych hospital. I am open to the 2nd option if needed, however he is not suicidal or threatening harm to himself or others so idk if it would be an option and regardless, I really think he should be given a full medical evaluation before defaulting to psychiatric hospitalization. But I also don\u2019t know if I would be able to have him admitted to a regular hospital since this may not be an \u201cemergency.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m panicking at this point y\u2019all. It\u2019s hard to work, hard to sleep, hard to eat. And financially we\u2019re hurting. I am so afraid I\u2019m not only losing my husband as a partner, but that he could possibly be really sick. His parents are also confused about what steps to take going forward. Please, I really need advice on what, if anything, I can do to help him. Sorry if this is long or confusing, I\u2019m frazzled at this point.",

I can make it louder by turning my head to the right, bending my neck all the way back, pushing on my forehead, jutting my jaw out, etc. I can even 'fake' the exact sound it makes when it's actually pulse-synchronous by doing these movements... the sound is the same.\n\n**The weirdest thing:** during the times the tinnitus is pulsing, I can STOP the pulsing by closing my teeth together. I CANNOT stop the pulsing by pressing anywhere on my neck or throat (I know that's a common test for vascular PT) I also cannot make a recording of the pulsing, which tells me it is probably a subjective noise and not 'real'.\n\n**Duration of Complaint:** 2-3 years, I don't know exactly, but it's been going on for quite a long time.\n\n**Factors to Consider:** I have a history of going to air shows and concerts without ear protection. I also used to work wedding receptions. For the last several years I have been using AirPods on my 6-7 mile daily walks, and I definitely had the music up way too loud to hear over traffic/outside noise. I know this is why I have the constant tinnitus. What I don't understand is why it is sometimes pulsatile. I protect my hearing now.\n\n**Tests I have had:**\n\n* **Brain MRI, with and without contrast, with IAC protocol:** totally clear and 'normal'\n* **Blood tests:** not anemic, liver and kidney function fine, thyroid levels are normal. Vitamin levels were not tested.\n* **Blood Pressure:** runs low if anything, has never been elevated when measured\n* **Hearing Test:** All thresholds normal, symmetrical hearing, including some extended high frequencies tested\n* **LDL/Tympanometry:** Normal LDLs and normal pressures\n* **Vestibular tests:** found a slight unilateral hypofunction on the RIGHT side, which is my 'better' tinnitus ear.. test was done to diagnose 24/7 rocking dizziness for a few months post-COVID infection. I've since 'compensated' for this and no longer feel dizzy.\n* **Chest CTA/EKG/Echocardiogram:** These were done last month because of a bad septic pneumonia infection, not because of the pulsatile tinnitus, but everything was perfect so I'm including it here just to mention that there probably isn't a cardiac concern.\n* **Eye Exam:** included digital images of my optic nerves, no papilledema seen\n\nI never cared about the noise before until I started being anxious about it, but now it causes me a great deal of anxiety and I listen to it constantly. I feel like I can habituate to it again if I could remove the anxiety that something is really wrong, since Googling 'pulsatile tinnitus' leads you down some scary rabbit holes, which is why I started seeking a doctor to begin with.\n\nI've been seeing an ENT/Neurotologist specialist, who I thought would be the best person for this due to his hyper-specialty but he seems unconcerned about my specific symptoms? I had to push for even the standard contrast brain MRI. He thinks if my PT was anything super concerning it would only ever appear in one ear and would be a more constant 24/7 thing.\n\nI think all of you doctors on here are so generous with your time and expertise, and I'm hoping you can give me some basic advice... **with my specific symptoms should I just put this to rest, or should I be seeking more scans ( brain MRA or carotid ultrasound?) And how urgently should I be seeking this out?**\n\nI'm not really trying to hunt down a cause for the PT, but I DO want to make sure that there's nothing dangerous going on.\n\nI'm really, really struggling with the anxiety. It's led me to restart Prozac after saying, years ago, that I'd never go back on another SSRI.\n\n(edited to include eye exam info, fixed typos)",

Jesus Christ this is horrible and I really need some medical advice\nSo I (22F) was fine and normal until a couple days ago\u2026.I live in New York and a couple days ago, the air quality increased badly. I did not know this until I was already outside. The humidity was terrible and I myself was wondering why the air felt so bad. When I came back inside, I started to feel loopy, winded, lightheaded and kinda felt sick as well. I even got a bad headache. This is not the first time it\u2019s happened. I seem to always have similar reactions whenever I\u2019m exposed to bad air quality. After freshening up and washing my face then relaxing for a bit, all symptoms seemed to subside. \n\nBut then the next morning, I had an extremely dry throat. This was a first and has never happened before. It wasn\u2019t a soar throat at first but it felt like sand paper, parched throat, like there\u2019s ashes in the bottom. Pretty much feels like there\u2019s some rough material that\u2019s stuck at the bottom of my throat. Each morning it got worse. Until it eventually felt like I had an actual soar throat. I was able to subside the feeling throughout the day with home remedies, throat spray, etc., but each morning it always comes back in FULL FORCE. This morning was the worst of all. I am now at the stage where I\u2019m constantly coughing and it\u2019s not really about the uncomfortable feeling of a soar throat anymore. I basically got no kind of sleep\u2026.at all. Not only is there an intense tickle in my throat or very frequent ones, but I am unable to basically relax my throat. It feels like my airways are closing in and every millisecond I\u2019m coughing. It feels like there\u2019s a lump of sand paper in my throat that\u2019s blocking my ability to breathe properly and as a result, I\u2019m coughing every minute, like my airways have been narrowed down to the max. \n\nAlongside this I\u2019ve been taking antibiotics prescribed by my GI doctor and its Metronidazole. I\u2019ve had an on/off chronic cough for a couple years now and it flares up the worst whenever I get sick. I will end up having an after cough up to 2 months after being sick. It is suspected that my chronic cough may be induced by gastrointestinal issues which is why I went to see a GI specialist a couple weeks back. The point of the antibiotics is just to remove any existing bacteria that may be in my stomach. \n\nIn this specific case though, I don\u2019t feel sick. I don\u2019t have a fever or any other common cold symptoms. I\u2019m just losing a lot of sleep over this BS. So I\u2019m not sure if me having this cough is a result of being sick from the air quality or something else.\n\nI\u2019m also a little afraid that it could be the way I\u2019m taking the antibiotics? I haven\u2019t taken antibiotics in years and forgot if there\u2019s any health consequences to not taking them the right way. Sometimes I miss some days I\u2019m supposed to take it but I try to make it up the minute I remember in the next couple of days. So when taking Metronidazole, there were some gaps in my consistency of taking it properly. And because my cough was getting so bad, my mom though giving me a shot of lime, honey and rum would kill it off because of the acidity. But I don\u2019t know if it was a bad idea to take a shot with alcohol in it since I\u2019m still taking the antibiotics.\n\nI really need some help on this, any clue as to what could be going on?",

Or just something somatic?\nF28, 160 cm, 70 kg\r  \nMedication: 2x20mg omeprazole, 1 one billion unit probiotic, and 3x60 mg alverine and simethicone daily for a colitis flareup (prescribed for a month, I\u2019m starting the third week), plus 1x500 mg extended release metformin, 2 myo-inositol, 1 vitamin D supplement daily, and .025mg cabergoline weekly to treat PCOS and elevated prolactin levels (prescribed for three months before checkup, also starting the third week)\r  \n\r  \nOn January I went to a GP about another colitis flareup, my main symptoms were bloating and starting to feel some fatigue. The GP only did a physical checkup, didn\u2019t ask for blood tests or other analysis. I complained mostly about pain/discomfort on my right side, right under the ribcage, and she told me she was ruling out liver problems on the basis alone that the pain didn\u2019t worsen in the area while she was feeling around. She prescribed me a week-long treatment and I felt a lot better.\r  \n\r  \nAround May I began experiencing a lot of stress and noticed I began bloating again, but due to financial problems I could only ignore it. It worsened with time, albeit slightly, and just at the beginning of July I was able to invest in getting checkups again.\r  \n\r  \nI started with a gynecologist due to some discomfort on my breasts, which to be honest caused me to panic and stress even more over the fear of it being breast cancer, but after an ultrasound and blood test, the doctor explained it was only an increase on my prolactin levels, a vitamin D deficiency and a couple of hormones having inverted values, as well as my insulin resistance flaring up again. I must admit I spent almost everyday at home until very recently, and my diet is/was not the best, so the vitamin D deficiency didn\u2019t really come as a surprise (from a baseline of =<30, I had 9.43). Still, the almost three-week waiting period raised up hell in my already uncomfortable gut.\r  \n\r  \nI took those blood work results to a gastroenterologist in case they were useful to her, since I read that vitamin D and prolactin are metabolized through the liver, but she disregarded them quickly. My symptoms were the same as the ones in January: I was uncomfortably bloated, spicy and greasy foods, which I had been honestly abusing lately, weren\u2019t sitting right with me and I had occasional diarrhea, although with no blood on sight. I also felt discomfort on my right side, right under my ribcage, again. During the physical checkup she also semi-ruled out liver problems, but still asked for a liver and bile duct ultrasound and a 32-element blood work to make sure.\r  \n\r  \nThe ultrasound report says: \"Moderate grade fatty liver, cholelithiasis without bile duct dilation\", and recommended to check certain values, which are as follows (I\u2019ll include the lab baseline values in parenthesis next to my values, since I live outside the USA and don\u2019t know if they vary):\r  \nAlbumin: 4.80 (3.97-4.94)\r  \nAlkaline phosphatase: 75.1 (35.0-104.0)\r  \nBilirubin: 0.57 (<=1.20)\r  \nALT: 32.9 (<=33.0)\r  \nAST: 21.9 (<=32.0)\r  \nGGT: 16.4 (<=40.0)\r  \n\r  \nThe ultrasound also recommended to check TP, TPT and prothrombin time, but my initial blood work didn\u2019t include it.\r  \n\r  \nThe gastroenterologist said she would let me know if it was necessary to go see her earlier when I sent my results, otherwise she would see me in a month. She only confirmed she had received my blood work and ultrasounds and didn\u2019t add anything else, so I\u2019m assuming I\u2019ll see her at the beginning of August.\r  \n\r  \nNow, starting on the third week of all the medicine I have to take, I\u2019ve noticed only small changes: I\u2019m not as bloated, but I\u2019m still bloated. I\u2019m not really feeling hungry (but I have to admit, I\u2019m also a very anxious person and normally during elevated anxiety periods I lose appetite completely). I burp after eating anything, no matter how little it is (for example, I burped after having two peach gummies the other day). My bowel movements go from slight constipation to slight diarrhea and they are consistently a soft brown color (I wouldn\u2019t call it clay-colored, but it\u2019s definitely lighter than my normal bowel movements). The general discomfort under my right ribcage has improved considerably, although when I get nervous/anxious I feel it. But now, every now and then, I feel little, very defined stabby pains in that area, instead of just general discomfort/ache. I would describe them as someone poking me with a sharp object. The pain lasts a few seconds at most and then goes away, but it leaves me scared. I\u2019m also sometimes dizzy and slightly nauseous, but haven\u2019t really thrown up during the treatment (and even before that, in a long time).\r  \n\r  \nNow, the thing is I don\u2019t know if these could be gallbladder attacks or the fatty liver acting up. Even if I go to sleep feeling those discomforts, I always wake up without them. Sometimes symptoms start shortly after waking up, but I\u2019ve noticed that happens only on days when I\u2019m feeling overtly-anxious and obsessively scanning my body. I can exercise without a problem and I\u2019ve noticed that even improves my overall perceived state. Still no blood on sight in my stool, and no traces of jaundice in my skin or eyes, although my eyes have also been very dry and kinda bloodshot, if that could be relevant?\r  \n\r  \nCould someone give me an insight of what could be happening? I must admit, again, that I have horrible health anxiety, so my fears range from gallstone attacks, to liver problems, to some sort of cancer (no other reason other than some blood values being so high while others are normal, though I admit I know nothing about it so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s truly an indication of something being severely wrong), so I don\u2019t know if I should go see another gastroenterologist sooner and push for an endoscopy/colonoscopy/something of the sort right now, or just wait a couple weeks more to see what my doc has to say.

        "context": "Sinus pressure on palate after jaw surgery\nHi all,\n\nI am currently 32, male.  I am obese and take medications for blood pressure and anxiety.  I was born with an underbite and crossbite and so at approx. age 25 I started a two part orthognathic surgical process to correct this.  The first surgery, a SARPE (surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion) was uneventful, but the bone-borne palatal expander that was implanted in the roof of my mouth fractured a week after surgery (while being activated via the wrench provided) and was prematurely removed, while the doctors maintained the transverse width that I had achieved to that point and move forward with orthodontics in preparation for the second surgery.  The second surgery, a Le Fort I osteotomy, advanced the maxilla forward.  I then had several additional months of orthodontics.\n\nAfter the braces were removed it was clear that my crossbite remained, likely as a result of inadequate expansion of the maxilla because of the palatal expander failure.  I was recommended for a revision surgery which I had done in 2019.  The new surgeon removed the hardware (plates and screws) from the Le Fort I osteotomy and repeated the SARPE procedure from scratch.  \n\nAfter this repeat SARPE surgery, the upper right quadrant of teeth either shifted downward entirely or the teeth erupted downward and I suffered root resorption and gum recession on almost all right side maxillary as a result.  I also developed a burning sensation in the right side of the hard palate, and a sensation of fullness/inflation when I breathe through my nose.  If I perform a Valsalva maneuver and breathe into my nose I feel air pressure on almost all teeth on the right side of the maxilla (and not the left), and it feels as if something is \"inflating\" between my right-side hard palate/teeth and the floor of my right nostril.  Additionally, if I shift my mandible left to right it activates a sort of suction/popping that is both clearly audible but also felt in those same areas of the palate/nasal floor.  I do not believe this popping is coming from the jaw joints (TMJ).\n\nA recent CT scan at my periodontist showed fluid in the right maxillary sinus, but other than that my jaw surgeon (who did the revision) has offered no explanation, and neither has any orthodontist or the periodontist himself.  The periodontist has recommended seeing an ENT which I am doing next month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestions: \n\n1. Why did the right side of my maxilla/those teeth shift downward after the revision SARPE procedure?\n2. Why did the gums recede on those teeth at the same time as the downward shift?\n3. What is going on with the air pressure/popping/clicking in the palate/nasal floor?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy jaw surgeon has shrugged off my complaints and it has made me feel powerless over my own health.

She is generally a very active person( runs every morning, has completed marathons in the past) and leads a healthy lifestyle. Social drinker. It will be long but I would deeply appreciate some insight here.\n\nMedical history: \n\n-At 15 she experienced 2 sudden and unexplained tonic clonic seizures about 2 months apart. She was still seeing a neurologist when I began seeing her 8 years ago, and taking Keppra daily. She has had one brain MRI and two EEGs all clear. She never had any other 'loss of consciousness' seizures again, but did experience an episode once about 5 years ago where she suddenly while watching TV Island folding laundry in the evening where she became very pale and clammy, expressed she needed to sit, and then it was as if she lost muscle tone. She was conscious throughout this and I would say it lasted maybe 2 minutes total. She brushed it off as anxiety.\nAfter her second EEG and with no further issues she was weaned off the anticonvulsant at 25(3 years ago) no issues since.\n\n-2 uncomplicated vaginal births.\n\n-uses zoloft and escitalopram for anxiety and major depressive disorder. Has struggled on and off in short occasional periods since teens. \n\nIn the last year I have noticed my fiance physically and mentally change. \n\nShe has suffered from the odd migraine for as long as I've known her. She had discussed it with her prior neurologist and she didn't have them frequently enough to be considered chronic migraine. They were more the odd annoyance and she knew the triggers to avoid.\n\nShe started having them frequently. There have been 2 episodes in the last month where she has literally broke down in tears and told me she can't take it anymore. She says its the one sided behind the eye throbbing. It is very easy to tell she is in a lot of pain. I tried to convince her to go to the ER because I was concerned but she was adamant that's wasting their time and it would pass. Both times she ended up taking ibuprofen, trying to lay down, vomiting, then reporting the throbbing was a bit better and then she went go right to sleep.\n\nShe is extremely fatigued this last 6 months or so to the point she could easily sleep all day and never feel rested. She complains often that her joints are achy and sore and its just easy to tell shes uncomfortable physically a lot of the time.   She goes to physical therapy but doesn't seem to help much . \n\nShe has more frequent bowel movements/ trips to bathroom in general and complains of stomach pain and frequent diarrhea.\n\nStruggling with dry blotchy skin, rashes and acne.\n\nLately when I talk to her I notice strange things. There have been a few times now she has lost her train of thought in conversation. And no it's not like she blanks and has an absence seizure or something. She will stutter, repeat a word, or get stuck. It's like she's aware too but can't control it. She definitely has some brain fog going on. \n\nToday she had an episode where she went to pass me a cup and then gave me a weird look. I asked her what was wrong and she told me she couldn't 'let go' and it hurt. It was super weird I could tell how tense her arm had become. It was like the muscle tightened, then let go. This was definitely not something she was voluntary doing. The way her muscle suddenly tensed (20 seconds or so) and softened was strange. Only the arm and no other twitches or movement.\n\nShe feels nauseous and dizzy a lot and I just feel in my gut that something is not right and I can't chalk it up to depression like I could at first. I feel like she is drastically physically changing and looking unwell rapidly. She has lost 10-15 lbs over the last few months but she has always had a petite build. She's so damn stubborn she says because all of her blood work is good there can't possibly be anything wrong, and that her symptoms are vague and not uncommon. \n\nI realize you can't give me a medical opinion based on what minimal information I have given you here but am I going crazy? Necause I'm starting to question if I'm reading too much into it and developing health anxiety about her (No history of anxiety here BTW lol) \n\nIf you were a doctor and someone presented to you with similar issues would you be concerned or have suspicions? I just want her to take this seriously and press for more than blood work. ( she has had cbc, thyroid, iron, glucose, liver, CRP all basic blood work done and all perfect)\n\nAny advice or opinions to maybe help her take it seriously would be appreciated. Thank you",

So, when I was younger I had semi-frequent episodes of diarrhea, then in my late teens/early 20s I started frequently having to strain to have bowel movements but also getting intermittent diarrhea, then the diarrhea subsided aside from rare occasion and I progressed from just having to strain to have a bowel movement to having to rock back and forth/side to side, to sometimes having to insert my fingers in my rectum to digitally remove feces, to basically becoming dependent on digital removal and enemas to have a bowel movement by my mid-20s. \r  \n\r  \nI brought this up to my PCP who first suggested I try various OTC laxatives (which didn\u2019t really do much), then later referred me to a gastroenterologist who recommended fiber and put me on lactulose, which I tried for around a few months which either did nothing or a couple times gave me uncontrollable explosive diarrhea with no therapeutic range where I could just have a normal bowel movement. I finally got the GI doc to give me a colonoscopy which came back normal, so he told me to just continue with the fiber and laxatives which were already not helping, so I basically just gave up on getting professional help for a while.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m now almost 35 and trying to take my health more seriously, and as a registered nurse I know that what I\u2019m experiencing is not normal and needs further evaluation. I go on bouts (I know I should be more consistent but struggle due to the untreated ADHD, also on the waitlist for a behavioral health provider) of taking fiber, magnesium citrate, and pre-/pro-biotics which are helping some, and I\u2019m basically to the point where I can sometimes initiate a BM naturally (especially if I wait longer than usual/comfortable once I\u2019ve had the sensation that I need to go) but still not go completely without digital stool removal or using an enema for the rest.\r  \n\r  \nOther relevant information:\r  \n\\-My stool is usually medium-brown in color, soft-formed or mushy, rarely hard/pebbly, I often express clear mucus from my rectum with or without stool, occasionally thick whitish stringy material in stool itself, and I\u2019ve noticed that some of the time when I have a BM without assistance it is very narrow (around finger-width) and sort of flat as if my internal anal sphincter doesn\u2019t like to fully/easily open (often feels like this when I insert fingers as well).\r  \n\\-I often have BLQ abdominal tenderness to palpation.\r  \n\\-I do get rare shooting pain from my anus to my penis; only happened a handful of times or so and seems random/unrelated to bowel movements or assisted stool removal.\r  \n\\-I have a small nodule (maybe pen-tip size if that) in my posterior rectum about 1 inch in (appeared \\~1.5 years ago, is small, soft, and has not grown in size; assessed by a family practice doc who gave me a referral to infectious disease despite all my STI tests coming back negative, that office said I should get a referral to a colo-rectal specialist, so I told the ordering doc and he just never got back to me). I assume it\u2019s from all the mild trauma initiated by digital insertion, enemas, and occasional anal sexual activity (see below) but don\u2019t know for sure.\r  \n\\-I do \u201cbottom\u201d and use anal sex toys a few times a year and have done so since my early teens, but I frequently avoid such activities due to my GI issues.\r  \n\r  \nSorry for the long-winded post, but I have a physical w/ my PCP next month and hope to have some suggestions of what to explore/tell her and maybe some advice of what I can do on my own to help.

The dentist ruled out a dental cause and suggested seeing an ENT.\n\nI had a scan done and the ENT said there was \u2018white\u2019 on the region of the scan and he didn\u2019t know what it was. So he referred me to another ENT department he thought could help.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t access his scan and to my recollection they ordered another one. They told me that they found an osteoma at the exact location of my pain, however they don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for an osteoma to cause facial pain. So they referred me to a pain clinic who said it was \u2018idiopathic facial pain\u2019 and probably neurological in origin. They said my best bet was seeing a \u2018pain psychologist\u2019 and taking nerve pain medication (which hasn\u2019t helped at all).\n\nI felt I wanted a second opinion on the osteoma and the pain, and finally got seen again by the ENT. They stated they couldn\u2019t access either of my scans, and had no record of the second scan and that it probably \u2018didn\u2019t happen\u2019 (it did). Nonetheless, he still was adamant that the osteoma couldn\u2019t cause facial pain and that pain psychology was the only treatment.\n\nNow, every study I have read states that sinus osteomas can and often do cause facial pain.\n\n\u2018The most common symptom of paranasal osteomas is pain including headache and facial pain (Atallah and Jay, 1981).\u2019 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319453411001044#:~:text=The%20clinical%20presentation%20of%20paranasal,Atallah%20and%20Jay%2C%201981).\n\nIt seems bizarre to me that there would be an osteoma at the exact location of the pain that\u2019s unrelated. What\u2019s even more bizarre to me is being told it can\u2019t cause facial pain when every study says it does.\n\nNow I\u2019m not certain this is the cause of the pain. However it confused me. Furthermore, I am not happy with the idiopathic/nerve diagnosis. They arrived at that from simply not finding another cause, and it really doesn\u2019t feel like a nerve problem to me (it feels very structural/physical, largely affected by pressure, I can feel/hear liquid/fluid opening closing etc).\n\nThey have stated they are going to try and locate the past scan, however that was from 4 years ago. I will pursue a new scan, but i am not convinced of whether the response will be any better.\n\nAny thoughts or advice would be useful!\n\nThanks",

I live in Southern California, I am a 5'7\" 140lb 27 Y/O Male who is very athletic. I eat clean, I exercise regularly, and take multivitamins. \n\nI was two months into the Sheriff academy when on the weekend of June 10th 2023 I got sick. Headache, nausea, chest congestion and an overall feeling of exhaustion. I've been sick before, so this wasn't alarming. I was coughing up yellow/green phlegm that following week, and was trying to dial it down but the intensity of the sheriff academy, my pride, and pushy instructors who don't \"allow you\" to be sick got the better of me, and I trained through it. Over the next few week I felt off but generally okay, all symptoms had subsided except I was coughing up green phlegm still, and I felt like I was operating at 70% capacity. I was still running 7-9 Miles at a 7 Minute flat pace, but I felt terrible doing it. At this time I was living in barracks housing, which was old, dirty, and there was mold present in some areas. \n\nFast forward a few weeks, I choose to remove myself from the academy for a variety of reasons, my wife and daughter needed me at home, my daughter is autistic and being away for weeks at a time was too hard on her, I was still sick, and ultimately I felt the job wasn't for me. Still coughing up green phlegm on Jun 26th I went to urgent care. The Physician I saw said I probably have bronchitis and prescribed the following:\n\ndoxycycline (MONODOX) 100 MG capsule (2 a day for 10 days)\r  \nalbuterol 108 (90 Base) MCG/ACT inhaler\r  \nmethylprednisolone (MEDROL DOSEPACK) 4 MG tablet (6-5-4-3-2-1 daily doses)\n\nI took 9 days worth of the antibiotic, but it was making me feel worse, and I skipped the last dose the 10th day. I took the steroid, as directed, with the exception of one day where I missed one of the four doses. \n\nAfter all that, I developed bad sinus pressure and nasal congestion, and the chest congestion was still present. I don't have the urge to cough, but when I exhale hard and deep, or \"Huff\" I can hear the crackling and can cough up the green mucus. Usually by the afternoon I feel halfway decent and most of my congestion has eased. But the next day I start all over again; plugged nose, green mucus, chest congestion, face pressure. I live at elevation and when I drive down the hill for work I get plugged up, ear pain, and sinus pressure. OTC stuff doesn't seem to help.\n\nI went back to the same urgent care on 7/14, the PA who saw me essentially told me to continue waiting it out, was very dismissive of me, and reluctantly ordered chest and sinus X-Rays of which I am still awaiting results.\n\nUltimately, as of today I am still sick, closing in on 40 days straight of CRAP! I have never been sick for this long in my entire life. Am I overthinking it? Do I just keep waiting? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nANY ADVICE IS GREATLY APPRECIATED, and I will promptly answer any questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks\n\n&#x200B;",

Pathology identified this as early balanitis xerotica obliterans. The most pressing concern for me was the increased sensitivity causing premature ejaculation, which I have never experienced before. After many visits to my PCP, a dermatologist, and two unsatisfying urologists, a family friend recommended a urologist who was compassionate and attentive. Since my condition was not improving, we decided circumcision was the best option. I underwent the procedure May 9. I now come to reddit with two concerns.\n\nFirst: it has been over two months since my surgery and I am still experiencing redness and irritation along the surgical scar. The increased sensitivity is still causing premature ejaculation during intercourse and pain in the area after sex.  It's also just generally sensitive and hurts if I pull on the shaft of my penis. I followed up with my urologist at the beginning of July, he says it appeared to be healing well. However, I am concerned that things are not going back to normal as expected. Is this healing timeline to be expected post circumcision?\n\nSecond: after my stitches dissolved and swelling began to subside, I noticed that the \"seam\" underneath the length of my penis was no longer centered. It seems when sewing everything up, they stitched things back together about a quarter inch rotated off center. Now the \"seam\" doesn't line up with where my frenulum was. Is this possible? Is this something I should be concerned about, and is it worth bringing up to my urologist who performed the surgery?

The doctor irrigated my left ear and also used some tools to pull out the rest of the ear wax. One pull was somewhat painful and the doctor apologized. Then after she was done, she said that I may see some blood coming out of my ear because she scraped my ear canal. \n\nIt's been about two hours and I haven't noticed any blood and my ears do feel much better with only some mild irritation in my left ear. \n\nMy question is, is there anything I should do as a precaution to avoid infection since my ear canal was scraped? I didn't think to ask in the moment because she left the room almost immediately after I said I felt better.

Turns out that all of my issues I had during pregnancy, the cause of my son\u2019s stillbirth, and my chest pain and dizziness were all a result of Rheumatic Heart Disease.\n\nI ended up having a stroke and I thought that would change my urgency of care, but still I was dismissed by all of my providers. My cardiologist was very condescending and said my issues, specifically worsening issues, such as extreme chest pain, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, feeling a cold fluid feeling in my chest, my swollen abdomen and feet, and a hard cough, were just the result of stress and anxiety. I asked for an updated echocardiogram since I had one last year and much has change with my symptoms. I was denied and said an echo was absolutely not needed in my case. \n\nI went to my primary care who was also condescending and said it was anxiety. At the point of anger and tears I told her I felt like I\u2019m dying and I needed help. She said she was not a cardiologist but if it would help me feel better she would order an echocardiogram at the local hospital. \n\nMonday I had the echo. Wednesday I was diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease affecting both the mitral and tricuspid valves. There is still no urgency from my care team. I\u2019m being ignored by my PCP. My cardiologist gave a half-hearted \u201cwe\u2019ll request the echo records\u201d when I called them. I feel even worse. My chest pain now only ends when I feel a burst of fluid that feels like it fills my chest and neck. I\u2019m having trouble breathing all the time. But if I have a feeling if I traveled to the ER again, I\u2019d be dismissed right away just like I was before in pregnancy and earlier postpartum. I\u2019ve had this chest pain for months and especially when I was pregnant but for all the 6 times I went to Labor and Delivery I was discharged right away and never given an EKG or any cardiac work up. Same with my OB. \n\nSeparately, I\u2019m seeing a neurologist for my TIA. He\u2019s found something doing an EEG and multiple MRIs. He won\u2019t tell me the results until my follow up on 2 weeks but told me I absolutely cannot work or drive. \n\nI\u2019m truly at a loss of what to do. If I call the office I get attitude from both the nurses and receptionists. I can\u2019t even find good information on this disease because it seems like it\u2019s not common in developed countries. I live in the US, I\u2019m upper-middle class, I have always taken my full course of antibiotics when I\u2019ve had strep. I just don\u2019t understand how of the thousands and thousands of dollars I\u2019ve spent trying to get help over the past few months all I have to show for it is a permanent heart condition, a dead child, and no plan moving forward.",

Is this new research reliable or better to still rely on the old scheme?\n2. In case it is safe, here where I reside they still do 3 jabs, would that be alright if I went for just 1 and never showed up for the rest? (It's not covered so paying 300\u20ac for 3 jabs isn't desirable if can be avoided).

        "context": "I need help to help my girlfriend who I believe is sick and in denial\nThis question pertains to my fiance who is a 28 year old female, 5'2 and approximately 110 lbs. She is generally a very active person( runs every morning, has completed marathons in the past) and leads a healthy lifestyle. Social drinker. It will be long but I would deeply appreciate some insight here.\n\nMedical history: \n\n-At 15 she experienced 2 sudden and unexplained tonic clonic seizures about 2 months apart. She was still seeing a neurologist when I began seeing her 8 years ago, and taking Keppra daily. She has had one brain MRI and two EEGs all clear. She never had any other 'loss of consciousness' seizures again, but did experience an episode once about 5 years ago where she suddenly while watching TV Island folding laundry in the evening where she became very pale and clammy, expressed she needed to sit, and then it was as if she lost muscle tone. She was conscious throughout this and I would say it lasted maybe 2 minutes total. She brushed it off as anxiety.\nAfter her second EEG and with no further issues she was weaned off the anticonvulsant at 25(3 years ago) no issues since.\n\n-2 uncomplicated vaginal births.\n\n-uses zoloft and escitalopram for anxiety and major depressive disorder. Has struggled on and off in short occasional periods since teens. \n\nIn the last year I have noticed my fiance physically and mentally change. \n\nShe has suffered from the odd migraine for as long as I've known her. She had discussed it with her prior neurologist and she didn't have them frequently enough to be considered chronic migraine. They were more the odd annoyance and she knew the triggers to avoid.\n\nShe started having them frequently. There have been 2 episodes in the last month where she has literally broke down in tears and told me she can't take it anymore. She says its the one sided behind the eye throbbing. It is very easy to tell she is in a lot of pain. I tried to convince her to go to the ER because I was concerned but she was adamant that's wasting their time and it would pass. Both times she ended up taking ibuprofen, trying to lay down, vomiting, then reporting the throbbing was a bit better and then she went go right to sleep.\n\nShe is extremely fatigued this last 6 months or so to the point she could easily sleep all day and never feel rested. She complains often that her joints are achy and sore and its just easy to tell shes uncomfortable physically a lot of the time.   She goes to physical therapy but doesn't seem to help much . \n\nShe has more frequent bowel movements/ trips to bathroom in general and complains of stomach pain and frequent diarrhea.\n\nStruggling with dry blotchy skin, rashes and acne.\n\nLately when I talk to her I notice strange things. There have been a few times now she has lost her train of thought in conversation. And no it's not like she blanks and has an absence seizure or something. She will stutter, repeat a word, or get stuck. It's like she's aware too but can't control it. She definitely has some brain fog going on. \n\nToday she had an episode where she went to pass me a cup and then gave me a weird look. I asked her what was wrong and she told me she couldn't 'let go' and it hurt. It was super weird I could tell how tense her arm had become. It was like the muscle tightened, then let go. This was definitely not something she was voluntary doing. The way her muscle suddenly tensed (20 seconds or so) and softened was strange. Only the arm and no other twitches or movement.\n\nShe feels nauseous and dizzy a lot and I just feel in my gut that something is not right and I can't chalk it up to depression like I could at first. I feel like she is drastically physically changing and looking unwell rapidly. She has lost 10-15 lbs over the last few months but she has always had a petite build. She's so damn stubborn she says because all of her blood work is good there can't possibly be anything wrong, and that her symptoms are vague and not uncommon. \n\nI realize you can't give me a medical opinion based on what minimal information I have given you here but am I going crazy? Necause I'm starting to question if I'm reading too much into it and developing health anxiety about her (No history of anxiety here BTW lol) \n\nIf you were a doctor and someone presented to you with similar issues would you be concerned or have suspicions? I just want her to take this seriously and press for more than blood work. ( she has had cbc, thyroid, iron, glucose, liver, CRP all basic blood work done and all perfect)\n\nAny advice or opinions to maybe help her take it seriously would be appreciated. Thank you",

        "context": "42M, Asian, 5'7\", ~175lbs, USA: Constipated and having frequent urges to urinate where not a lot comes out\nI already called my doctor and have an appointment early next week as the office said this is not an emergency.  Though I'm looking to get some information to help deal over the weekend.\n\nI say I'm constipated, but I still poop everyday.  Though starting on Wednesday  I was not getting complete evacuation.  I would poop an ok looking log, but it felt more was in there that did not want to come out.\n\nWednesday night I could feel bloating and that poop was backing up.  This happened again Thursday with my morning poop not getting everything to come out.\n\nI have been eating healthy, exercising, and loss a bunch of weight this year.  I cut out all Alcohol, candy, soda, junk food, milk, ice cream, and really revamped my whole diet to be healthy.  I don't smoke, do drugs, or on any kind of medication.   I try to keep good gut health drinking kombucha for the probiotics and all that stuff.\n\nRecently in the last few weeks I've been concentrating on eating more fiber to bulk up my poops a little bit more as I felt they were a touch loose.  I may have over did it as this may have caused my constipation as I was not drinking enough liquids to offset the increase in fiber.\n\nA side effect of this constipation seems to be the need to pee often, though when I pee not a lot comes out.  This usually happens at night after dinner and gets worst while I'm trying to sleep.  It's to the point that I'm try to pee, I feel like I'm done, go back to bed and 5 minutes later I have the I need to pee feeling again.\n\nSo I was talking with a friend yesterday about my constipation and they said a salt cleanse helped them in the past to get things moving.  So I read up on that yesterday and it seemed simple enough to try.  I did it first thing this morning and boy did lots of poop and sludge come out.\n\nI probably pooped water on and off for 30 minutes. At the end the water was pretty clear so I felt like it did it's job.  I did instantly feel better the rest of the morning.  I ate a egg and avocado sandwich for lunch, 5 hours after pooping water, to keep things light and have drank lots of water and a Kombucha today to rehydrate for all that lost water.\n\nOne thing in particular is the need to pee often with not much coming out has not gone away. I have had that pretty much all afternoon and still have it now as I type this post.  I'm been doing some Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles the last hour and that seem to have help things a bit.\n\nI still feel like I have to pee, but it's more an annoying feeling of something in the chamber then I have to pee right now.  I'm not sure if this matter, but it's a data point.\n\nSo now one thing I did Tuesday night, that may be important, was have some bedroom fun with my girlfriend.  So now I enjoy edging and she loves taking the dominate role at times.  So on this night we went at it where she basically controlled when and how I would cum.\n\nWe got to a point where I was rock hard riding the edge as she was stroking me.  At one point I felt the urge to pee and I said I have to pee.  She played her dominate role and say no peeing.\n\nHonestly I kind of liked it. The urge to pee while riding the edge, felt great.  So I went with it and didn't use our safe word to stop.\n\nIf anything I felt even harder having to pee and riding the edge.  My girlfriend was loving it, even commenting how much harder I was than normal.  This lasted for at least 45 minutes before I ejaculated and my penis had this vibrating feeling that was out of this world.\n\nAt that point I still had to great urge to pee but I was rock hard from all of the stimulation.  This made peeing pretty difficult, but I pushed it out.  I will say pushing out the pee was not smooth in the sense that t was kind of stop and start peeing.   In hindsight this may have not been the best move.\n\nThough I noticed \\~15 minutes later when I was completely soft that I felt like I had to pee again.  I went and only a dribble came out.\n\nI tell you all this because that urge to pee feeling I get now, feels pretty much the same as that urge to pee after 15 minutes I just mentioned.  If I do pee more the a dribble then it's has this stop and stop feel to it as well when I try to relax the muscle holding the pee back.  I don't know if they are related or just coincidence, but I felt it was worth a note.\n\nAnyways if anybody has some advice fore getting through the weekend that would be great.  I have no idea what tomorrow will bring and if all my issues will just go away with a night of sleet, but I'm looking for an opinion / some advice.\n\nMy doctor's office did not think this was an emergency, so I should not have much to worry about, but this urge to pee is pretty annoying.   It's been a little over an hour since I last peed as the Kegel exercises I talked about above seem to setting things down.  It's more of a tingle now then an all out I have to pee.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions and I apologize for any bad grammar or spelling.  Thanks for any help.\n\n&#x200B;",

The deposit looked like a bunch of very fine threads tangled together when I pulled it off.   \nTo be very precise with the location, it was around the tip of my penis and only visible when I retracted my foreskin slightly. I'm not sure what it is, and it's kinda making me panic. Any advice will be appreciated. ",

I went to the dentist and all they did was give my teeth a clean. This actually helped with the sensitivity. However, over the next two years, I recognized that every time I would wake up in the morning, my mouth was very sour still. During this same time, my mouth would also become quite sour immediately after eating (I'm talking minutes or sometimes seconds after even just eating a snack). \n\n  \nThe most alarming aspect of all of this though, was how I noticed that my teeth were seemingly eroding away: my canine teeth and premolars especially were getting increasingly shaper in angle (look more like a shark with how pointy they have become). Additionally, the spaces between my teeth are now much larger: before this period, it was slightly difficult to fit my dental floss between each tooth but now there is so much space so that there is no difficulty in fitting the floss between each tooth, highlighting the wear. \n\n  \nWith all this in mind, I was confident that I had acid reflux/GERD/GORD. I went to my dentist who was unsure if this actually was acid reflux but was more confident in this being bruxism (grinding). They made a night guard and told me to see if it gets worse. My erosion did get more noticeable and the sour taste was still there. \n\n  \nThus, I went to see a gastroenterologist who, over the course of a year, carried out a 24 hour pH test and then a 48 hour BRAVO pH test to see if I really did have acid reflux. These two tests showed that I likely did not have acid reflux. However, before these two tests, the gastroenterologist prescribed me with omeprazole (20mg, which didn't work for long before upping this up to 40mg). I have been on this 40mg dose ever since (just before bed as I normally wake up with a very sour taste and I have noticed that my teeth wear away the most over night), despite these negative GERD indications.\n\n  \nI also then went to see an oral specialist and told her my experience about how eating a Gaviscon antacid tablet is helpful in getting rid of the sour taste that I experience immediately after eating. They said if the Gaviscon helps, it probably is a stomach issue and that she cannot help with that. She then sent me to do some bloods which returned all normal except very low zinc levels, but I'm not sure if that's related.\n\n  \nNow, I am extremely anxious and confused about what I should do. I do think I have acid reflux because besides from the symptoms i've mentioned beforehand, the back of my throat does also feel more sensitive and irritable, especially with spicy food. There is no question that my teeth are not in good shape, and definitely not like how they were before this whole period of experiencing sourness began. \n\n  \nPlease, can someone give me a possible explanation for what has been happening and what I can do about this?  \n",

My question is, how exactly does constipation happen in the bowels? If my son takes high enough doses of stool softeners and laxatives, he'll have one or two mushy poops per day. If he misses a dose or gets a smaller dose, the next day he will still poop, but it will be hard and small. The next day pebbles, and the day after that, he stops pooping altogether. When he gets back on the laxatives, he will go back and forth between pooping water and pooping pebbles until his stool gets back to normal consistency & frequency. \n\nHow could he go from soft wet poops to hard poops within a day? Wouldn't it need to be in his colon longer to get that hard? Does it mean that too much water is being pulled from his intestines?

I just now accidentally kicked the door and stubbed toenail, so half of it came off. He gave me an open bandaid that he already touched while he was talking. I grabbed it, but then threw it away for another one. I washed my hands before grabbing the new one, but it was only for a few minutes, and I didn't really dry properly. If he had rabies (which he probably doesn't), how likely is it that his saliva from when he was talking got on the bandaid, transferred to my hand when I touched it, and then didn't get washed off before I applied the new bandaid?

Sometimes a decrease in WBC can be due to medication use (i.e antibiotics, antihistamines, autoimmune drugs, antacids), poor nutrition, vitamin deficiency, viral illness or anemia. This level will typically return to normal, but in severely and persistently low WBC, this can be related to infection, autoimmune disorders, or malignancy, and warrants follow-up care.  \nPlease schedule a Health Services/Blood Draw Only visit in one month with us to draw blood and recheck your complete blood count and a blood smear. I want to make sure any abnormal levels do not persist or warrant further evaluation.

I was really trying to push it to the max I could tolerate but from what i've been reading (yea it hurts so bad I go back reading over the same old stuff hoping I find something I missed) thats really not the way to use it.\r  \n\r  \nEffexor - felt like a headache shift. If I had to guess I would say it helped my migraines but made the serotonin headaches worse (it was before adderall)\r  \n\r  \nmedial branch block c2:c3 - the procedure hurt insanely badly until the next day and they only injected a medicine that would numb occipital neuralgia for 2 hours **so I have no idea if it worked or not**. It seems like they should have anticipated I would be unable to articulate the different extreme pains so close to each other in the back of my head/neck.\r  \n\r  \n**A few more relevant notes:**\r  \n\r  \nI had a brain MRI, its fine. I had a neck MRI, they said I have some problems but they should not be bad enough to be causing any of my headaches:\r  \n\r  \nStraightening of cervical lordosis.\r  \n\r  \nMultilevel mild degenerative disc disease changes at C3-C7 with multilevel mild canal stenosis. There is no disc protrusion or cord compression.\r  \n\r  \nMild diffuse facet degenerative changes as described. I passed the caloric stimulation test but i do have tinnitus.\r  \n\r  \n**Trigger Point Injection day was frigging awesome**. For 2 hours I felt like a normal person. They said the fact that it was only 2 hours meant it failed. They said I had to be responding to the numbing medicine (Bupivacaine HCl (MARCAINE)) and not the real medicine they shot in there (triamcinolone acetonide (KENALOG-40)).\r  \n\r  \n**It looks like there are a lot of possibilities for what the remaining headache could be:**\r  \n\r  \nwhiplash damage - someone was driving a truck in the rain without windshield wipers and I was stopped at a red light. he hit me doing about 45 without trying to slow down at all because he couldnt see in the rain but that was 15 years ago and this has only been a problem for half that long\r  \n\r  \ncervicogenic headache - because its not a throbbing pain and the diagram showing pain from the top half the neck to the top of the head is perfect for me most of the time. But I went to physical therapy 8 times and a chiropractor 6 times.\r  \n\r  \nCraniocervical Instability - was suggested last time but the chiropractor would feel that right?\r  \n\r  \nchronic sub-occipital trigger point issues from bad posture - Another Aspie suggested this to me. Maybe we keep those flexed. I do lean my head forward an extreme amount. That is the area that hurts the most (when things are good and its not the whole back of my head this is actually the only area hurting).\r  \n\r  \nCFS leak - was suggested by the most people last time because of how much laying down for 30 minutes helps or how bad I feel shortly after getting out of bed in the morning. Laying down seems to help me considerably more than other people having a headache. However Theophylline didn't help so that seems to rule out CFS leak. I read CFS leaks cause \"postural headaches\" and you can can get postural headaches for other reasons than CFS leak. Perhaps I should be tested for those less common reasons.\r  \n\r  \nTension headache - But I think its tension headache even though the sides almost never hurt and I only have pain behind my forehead every once in a while. Adderall kills the migraines, makes the tension headaches worse, I take some tizanidine and the headaches go back to how they were before. Also, back before I had any issues resolved Propranolol helped me the most. And propranolol helps migraines and tension headaches. So if it was curing two different kinds of headaches that would definitely explain why it was the best (but it made me so tired I laid down more so that might be misleading me). I can't take Propranolol now. It completely nullifies the Adderall. I need a different muscle relaxer to test this further. Tizanidine ruins noradrenaline and makes me incredibly sleepy. I read there are muscle relaxers that don't change noradrenaline at all, don't significantly raise serotonin (if it raises serotonin more than Adderall's tiny bit I'd guess I can't tolerate it), and are less tiring than Tizanidine I just don't know if they are good for tension headaches.\r  \n\r  \nCould you suggest any tests or medications for me to request from my many doctors?

        "context": "Need advice for my partner (37M)\n\nNote: using a throwaway account.\n\nI have been with my partner for about seven years. We have chosen not to become legally married but consider ourselves in a domestic partnership (I mention this to note that while i consider him my husband and am dedicated to him as such, I don\u2019t have the legal rights a legal spouse might have).\n\nBackground details about him: He is white (non-Hispanic) and we live in the USA. He is a 37-year-old cisgender man. He has had long-standing mental health problems (mostly extreme anxiety) since getting sepsis at age 14 which he barely survived. He used to be a heavy drinker before we got together but rarely drinks now. He also used to smoke cigarettes (about 8 a day) and marijuana, but for the past month has cut back on both considerably. He drinks about one energy drink w caffeine daily. He doesn\u2019t do any other recreational drugs. He is prescribed vyvanse, gabapentin, and viibryd for daily use and he *says* he\u2019s been taking them, but I strongly suspect based on the pills he has on hand and his behavior that he hasn\u2019t been for probably 1.5-2 months. He also was prescribed Xanax for occasional panic attacks (so not for daily use) but I don\u2019t think he has taken any in probably 2+ months. He hasn\u2019t seen his psychiatrist in months either. The past year or so was an extremely stressful year for him at work, with the worst occurring about mid-spring of this year, and it was definitely rough for him considering his mental health problems. \n\nCurrent problem: for the past two months he has been declining in every way. He hasn\u2019t showered in at least a month and will only occasionally use bathing wipes I bought for him. He stopped going to work and won\u2019t get a job. He lost his phone for several weeks and had no interest in finding it, so he had to get a new one. He doesn\u2019t spend any time with me and was incredibly rude to his family when they visited last week. He sleeps a lot and spends much of his waking hours in a daze. But most concerningly, he\u2019s become increasingly difficult to converse with. Half of what he says doesn\u2019t make any sense or is filled with non-sequiters. When we went out to eat with his family, he couldn\u2019t even order for himself because he was in a daze. He makes strange jokes and doesn\u2019t remotely understand why me and his parents are concerned. Nor does he understand why he lost his job or why finding a job would be important. We have begged him to see a doctor and he won\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d need to. My husband used to be an extremely hard-worker, always kept up to date on cleaning the house, showered daily, and was very intelligent. We loved watching movies together and playing board games. Now he\u2019s a completely different person and I miss him so much.\n\nHis parents live in another state and the only reason they came here this past week was because I told them I was becoming very concerned. When they visited they agreed that something is wrong, and as the visit progressed they started to suspect, as I do, that despite my partner\u2019s mental health history, this may be something more than a psychiatric problem. It is genuinely hard to describe unless you interact with him, but to us his behavior may indicate something is neurologically, or possibly hormonally, wrong beyond mental illness.\n\nI have reached a point where I have no idea what to do. I have been googling advice and everything tells me either 1) do nothing bc he can make his own decisions, even though I don\u2019t think he\u2019s mentally well enough to do so, or 2) have him admitted to a psych hospital. I am open to the 2nd option if needed, however he is not suicidal or threatening harm to himself or others so idk if it would be an option and regardless, I really think he should be given a full medical evaluation before defaulting to psychiatric hospitalization. But I also don\u2019t know if I would be able to have him admitted to a regular hospital since this may not be an \u201cemergency.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m panicking at this point y\u2019all. It\u2019s hard to work, hard to sleep, hard to eat. And financially we\u2019re hurting. I am so afraid I\u2019m not only losing my husband as a partner, but that he could possibly be really sick. His parents are also confused about what steps to take going forward. Please, I really need advice on what, if anything, I can do to help him. Sorry if this is long or confusing, I\u2019m frazzled at this point.",

I bleed heavy, and cramp before, during, and after my period. I\u2019d honestly say half of my life is spent in pain due to my cycle.

I can\u2019t honestly remember when I noticed them. They are right at hip level on my lower back, kind of where some people may have lower back dimples. They are in the same position on both sides. One side is significantly larger than the other. They change in size, and I\u2019ve noticed they seem larger around my period. The largest is the size of a golf ball in my back, but sometimes they\u2019re more penny-sized. They are moveable and you can manipulate them a bit but they never fully go away. Could these be some sort of gland becoming inflamed? The reason I think it\u2019s related to my period is because the majority of the pain on my period centers around those two areas and spreads. The pain in recent times has kept me from getting out of bed. I do TENS, heating pads, baths; no OTC painkiller gives any relief.

I am male, 35 years old, white, average height and build, no significant past medical history. \n\nYesterday I engaged in consensual BDSM sex for the first time. Something unexpected happened, in that my partner bit down on my penis mid-shaft and roughly squeezed my left testicle. This was startling and painful, but we were both more shocked by the small drop of blood that immediately appeared from my urethral meatus. We stopped, and I took the opportunity to go and empty my bladder. I kept my pants on the rest of the night, we made no further attempts to engage in oral sex nor any penetrative sex. \n\nI've seen no more blood since that initial single drop, not last night nor at all today, and it has not been painful to urinate today (last night it was just a bit sensitive the first time). On my penis, there's no swelling, redness, bruising or any other visible mark, no pain on urination, maybe the faintest general discomfort sort of localised towards the tip. My left testicle feels a bit tender and could be a little larger, or it might just be in my head, if it is swollen it is certainly subtle (my partner didn't know this but my left testicle has been aching on and off for over a year, for which my GP prescribed \"watch and wait\"). I haven't tried to get erect since last night so I don't know if that would cause any pain. \n\nThis has all been somewhat mortifying. Obviously the safe answer is \"go see a doctor\". I'd rather not, especially not if it will just be a wasted trip where they say \"you look fine, no obvious signs/symptoms, come back if it gets worse\". Not that it should matter, but I know it does - I'm in the UK, on the NHS. Is it fine to just skip the humiliation of a first trip and only go if anything changes? Or is there something I don't know about this kind of small injury that could come back to \"bite\" me later?",

After the second case of this my doctor ran PTH, ionized calcium, and vitamin D blood work. This time calcium came back within range as did ionized calcium and PTHrP was low and PTH intact was low normal. Vitamin D showed I was deficient so doctor said this was probably the cause. Now 2023 just got routine blood work back and there it is hypercalcemia again fueling my anxiety.

Heavy weight, numbness, tingling, weakness entire body\n27M, no meds, no drugs, no smoking, EU, SIBO and plenty of digestive issues.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI know it says No emergencies questions on the right side but I'm at lost and I really need an opinion so I hope you can forgive me, otherwise if you have another subreddit where I can post this... Appreciated.\n\nI called my local Emergency and they said it was nothing alarming, but I'm honestly scared right now something wrong is evolving and they're blatantly ignoring it.\n\n**Rant:**\n\nIt's terrible to be told at the phone that I'm young & in great health when I'm telling them I have pale stools, chronic digestive issues, numbness, tingling and weakness in the feet and arms.\n\nI feel like I'm in the wrong country to begin with to get help? Or I don't speak correctly my native language, or am I too naive to try to stay rational at the phone and not being an hysterical mess... ?\n\n**Intro:**\n\nBeen a few days that I'm feeling a growing numbness and paralysis in feet, along with a heat wave, particularly when I eat, but then it goes away within an hour or two.\n\nIt appeared yesterday while eating my oatmeal as bedsnack, and it never went away until I went asleep, whereas **usually** it goes away within minutes.\n\nI've been having this issue at least for 2 weeks, it was happening every few days at the beginning and would last a few minutes at best. Looks like it's evolving to be every day now, almost like every meal...\n\n**What happened:**\n\nI just woke up a few hours earlier and went into eating my oatmeal like usual and :\n\n\\- Numbness, tingling in feet started to appear. No panic yet, I become used to it.\n\nI keep eating and :\n\n\\- I felt a very heavy weight on my mind and whole body, like something or me is going to collapse under something extremely heavy.\n\n\\- I also felt like my heart is going to stop. My body went super silent, I had a short breath and it felt hard to keep it up. It was incredibly scary, the scariest thing I've actually ever experienced for the past few years.\n\nAt this point I start to panic a bit, I called my local emergency for an opinion.\n\nI explain what's happening => Nothing alarming... \"I could send you a doc for checking your reflexes...\"\n\nI'm confused and I say I probably need a bloodwork right now and he answers with \"if the doc says so but your presence right now isn't justified at the emergency room...\". I deny sending me a doc, because I thought by the time he comes in, I'll be either dead or fine, pointless in both cases.\n\nAfter the call, things get worst, numbness goes into my face, then in my whole upper body...\n\nI could still talk (to myself) and laugh with effort, so I tell myself good, probably I won't die...\n\nThe numbness & tingling on my face felt like some kind of paralysis was taking over my body. I was 100% conscious the entire time, aside from the collapsing feeling I was 'trying' to go against.\n\nI felt like flu-like symptoms, weird muscles pains at every joint of my body and I was moving a lot like if I was trying to find a position to alleviate the pain.\n\nWhile going through that last point, I drank plenty of water.\n\nIt's been a while I had a suspicion of electrolytes imbalance, so I thought if it was hyperkalemia, water would wash the excess away,\n\nNow the numbness is almost gone, I have like 10% left in the feet, but it's still quite heavy on my whole body, not to mention the fatigue which is more extreme than usual (which is already quite bad).\n\n**IMPORTANT:**\n\nI took Bactrim 2 weeks ago for an UTI and I lost consciousness for a few seconds, I was paralyzed in my entire body. **I stopped taking it right after that.**\n\nThis was not an allergic reactions. Because the paralysis symptoms I've experienced just a few moment ago are almost identical to when I lost consciousness. Could this really be K related... ? The warnings of the med says Hyperkalemia risks, but considering my chronic digestive issues (SIBO) in that nutrients and calories are badly absorbed (bulky stools), I would be most likely low than high...\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI still feel like I'm going to collapse and very wary about what to do next.\n\nWhat's your opinion on this?\n\nI'm thinking about going for some simple salty rice meal, avoid potassium and calcium entirely for the time being, and drink plenty of water... maybe sodium bicarbonate?\n\nThank you.",

        "context": "Kidney infection or stones?\nHi, 26F here. \nSo starting Wednesday night, I noticed my urine had an extremely strong smell, despite drinking around 2L of water on a cold winter day. Wednesday, I made sure I was definitely hydrated and drank around 2L+ just in the afternoon, but still had that extremely strong urine smell and noticed it looked much darker than it should having just drank that much water over a few hours. \n\nThursday afternoon, still having the strong urine, I started to feel like my bladder was still full after peeing. This is when I caught on that something definitely was not right and suspected a possible UTI but had no pain at all. I had possibly used the bathroom a little more than usual that day, though nothing drastically noticeable, but as the afternoon progressed I was peeing small amounts quite frequently with a lot of discomfort around my bladder area. \n\nI went and saw my GP who used one of those dip sticks and said my urine looked fine and that the stick only showed a very small amount of white blood cells. She sent it off for a urine culture test and gave me a script for antibiotics but told me not to take them until they get the results back on Saturday and will call me if it's positive for a UTI, unless it gets worse. \n\nThat brings me today,  Friday. My urine smelled strong this morning but is ok now. Around noon, I started to experience pain on both my sides and my back. I've not got my results back but bought and started the antibiotics (Cefalexin 500mg, twice a day). \n\nI haven't been feeling the bladder fullness since this morning or needing to pee since around noon. Throughout this whole experience, I've experienced no pain while urinating at all and have had no blood in my urine and I don't have a fever. \n\nAt the moment I'm mostly experiencing a sharp pain on my left side, with occasional pain on the right side. There is pain when I press on my left side. It gets worse when I walk and move around. \n\nWhile the pain started by being there pretty consistently on both sides while at work (mostly driving and standing), its now an on and off stabbing pain that lasts a few seconds while sitting or laying down, or consistently there when walking. \n\nThe pain isn't unbearable, if I get a bad stab it's maybe gotten to a 6 or so and makes me jump. It's mostly just really uncomfortable and annoying. \n\nOriginally I thought my UTI may have turned into a kidney infection but now I'm wondering if I have stones. I also started Aspen Dexamphetamine about 9 days ago, prescribed my by Psychiatrist for ADHD. No other medication or medical conditions other than PCOS.\n\nMy plan is to continue the antibiotics and go back to my doctor if it doesn't go away or to ER if the pain gets severe. \n\nAny thoughts? I'd love to have a better idea on what I may be dealing with. Thanks!!",

She did have diabetes after the surgery but that has also resolved. Now, 3.5 years later, my mom is facing the prospect of a kidney transplant. Apparently the anti rejection drugs are very toxic and as such, her kidney function is severely compromised. She had 1 hospitalization in march 2022 for kidney failure (it was terrifying)which kept her in the hospital an entire month. \n\nIn the last 3 months she has lost 30 pounds and weighs 97lbs now, about 5\u20195. The stress levels for our family have been huge, so that is definitely playing a huge role. \n\n6 weeks ago she was told dialysis is imminent with kidney functioning levels at 18. \n\nShe met with her care team on Wednesday this week and they said her kidney function is up to 30 now and they aren\u2019t looking at dialysis on the same timeline. They were quite shocked at the recovery. \n\nShe\u2019s supposed to meet with a vascular surgeon anyways so they can assess her for a port, as they feel it is inevitable she will eventually need dialysis. \n\nMy mom is in discomfort all the time. Her headaches, the horrible leg cramps every night, bowel issues, all of it is so much to endure for 1 person, her medication is life sustaining but it\u2019s also slowly killing her.

Is it unusual for her kidney function to go up and down so much? \n\n2. if the situation Becomes acute, can she get dialysis right away or will they try to do a transplant immediately? \n\n3. Will the kidney transplant be physically easier to recover from than the lung transplant? \n\nSorry if this post is scattered, things are very difficult right now. \n\nMy mom is the centre of my world\u2026thank you very much for taking the time to read this.

He used to be a heavy drinker before we got together but rarely drinks now. He also used to smoke cigarettes (about 8 a day) and marijuana, but for the past month has cut back on both considerably.

[26M]\n**Me**\n\n26 M white male, no other health issues, nonsmoker, nondrinker\n\n**Symptoms**  \n1. Constant tension headaches for 8 months which feel like pressure around my ears, my forehead, and my temple region. Little if any pain, but lots of tightness that is severely uncomfortable.\n\n2. Ear fullness that I can \"pop\" away but consistently returns  \n**What I've tried**\n\nIt's unclear what the cause is, which is infuriating. Here are the things that I've tried.\n\n1. Prednisone \u2014 Helped a lot, but told I can't stay on it\n2. Botox - Also very helpful, but of course is a \"bandaid\"\n3.

CT Scan of TMJ joints \u2014 Normal\n4. Sleep Test: AHI of 5.6, RDI of 20.0 (mild-moderate sleep apnea)\n   1. I'm quite skinny and I sleep on my stomach, so maybe more likely UARS?\n\n**What makes it worse**\n\n1. When I bite together, I feel a muscle around my ears being triggered and they instantly get more \"full\". I'm not sure whether this is related to my tension headaches, but the ear fullness I feel when doing this is the same as the symptom I outline.\n\n**Important Notes**\n\n1. I have very little stress. I really manage stress well. Beyond stress *caused by* this, it's not stress. I am retired. I have a great life. I meditate and exercise. No mental health issues. \n\n**My theories**\n\n1. TMJ\n   1. I don't *currently* clench my teeth while sleeping or awake. However, this did begin 3 months after a stressful period where I was clenching a lot. I wonder if this messed up a disc.\n      1. My bite jerks to one side at a certain point during mouth opening, which it didn't used to. **However, a TMJ specialist (regarded as one of the best in NYC and referred to me by my orthodontist, who thought my disc could be messed up) believed that this could not be caused by my disc.** \n      2. I do not have pain or visible TMJ issues on CT scan, so according to specialist, this is unlikely.\n2. UARS/OSA \n   1. I'm getting a CPAP machine to try because I'm desperate. But I don't think that it will help me very much. I don't really suffer from any fatigue. But who knows.\n   2. This was put forth as the main theory by the TMJ specialist after seeing my sleep study\n\n**My questions**\n\n1. Could I have a disc issue based on the above? I don't have pain in either TMJ at all, and the CT was normal, but I'm not sure this jerking motion is as \"normal\" as it was made out to be by the specialist. **Should I push for an MRI of that disc?**\n2. If this is related to UARS/OSA, **does that explain the chronic ear fullness?** This is a very distinct symptom that started exactly at the same time\n3. What else am I not thinking of? Is it really true that these headaches can just randomly appear and my best hope is trying random stuff?",

I am male, 35 years old, white, average height and build, no significant past medical history. \n\nYesterday I engaged in consensual BDSM sex for the first time. Something unexpected happened, in that my partner bit down on my penis mid-shaft and roughly squeezed my left testicle. This was startling and painful, but we were both more shocked by the small drop of blood that immediately appeared from my urethral meatus. We stopped, and I took the opportunity to go and empty my bladder. I kept my pants on the rest of the night, we made no further attempts to engage in oral sex nor any penetrative sex. \n\nI've seen no more blood since that initial single drop, not last night nor at all today, and it has not been painful to urinate today (last night it was just a bit sensitive the first time). On my penis, there's no swelling, redness, bruising or any other visible mark, no pain on urination, maybe the faintest general discomfort sort of localised towards the tip. My left testicle feels a bit tender and could be a little larger, or it might just be in my head, if it is swollen it is certainly subtle (my partner didn't know this but my left testicle has been aching on and off for over a year, for which my GP prescribed \"watch and wait\"). I haven't tried to get erect since last night so I don't know if that would cause any pain. \n\nThis has all been somewhat mortifying. Obviously the safe answer is \"go see a doctor\". I'd rather not, especially not if it will just be a wasted trip where they say \"you look fine, no obvious signs/symptoms, come back if it gets worse\". Not that it should matter, but I know it does - I'm in the UK, on the NHS. Is it fine to just skip the humiliation of a first trip and only go if anything changes? Or is there something I don't know about this kind of small injury that could come back to \"bite\" me later?",

I understand this is not a substitute for actual medical advice and already have an appointment to see my PCP for a referral. I feel like I'm going crazy or have some neurodegenerative disease, and just want to hear someone else's oppinion. This is how it feels anyways, I'm definitely not trying to diagnose myself\n\nFor probably the last year, I have been becoming increasingly more forgetful, less perceptive of my environment, struggle to form words and remember simple words to use, have a continually decreasing inner dialogue playing in my head, and am not thoughtful when I taking in information (ie my mind is blank when someone tells me something or I learn of something happening; I have no mental reaction besides simple phrases ive memorised to use for the most common scenarios). I repeat words and phrases many times in my head after I utter them out loud which I never did before. The depth and breadth of my thoughts are shallow. I get frustrated very easily too, which is not like myself.\n\nI also constantly have irritable bowels, muscles aches, and restless nights for the last 2 months\n\nI work in healthcare as a CNA/QMAP and my mental state makes it impossible to do my job. I am seriously underperforming; im not communicating properly, don't know what to do or ask when I'm with patients anymore, I make simple mistakes when preparing medications to pass out, and forget what I'm doing constantly.\n\nI guess the last bit of information you need to know about me is that I've been incredibly ashamed of a part of my identity for the past 2 years. It's not something I could live with until recently and made plans to kill myself many times in the past 2 years because of it. I never followed through with the plans though. I've heard about depression induced pseudodementia and it sounds like a possible cause for my failing mental state. The shame and stress caused from confronting that part of my identity also made me physically sick for months and made my skin hypersensitive to touch and temperature as well. I still get flair-ups with my skin being hypersensitive, but now it only lasts for a day every now and again.",

Turns out that all of my issues I had during pregnancy, the cause of my son\u2019s stillbirth, and my chest pain and dizziness were all a result of Rheumatic Heart Disease.\n\nI ended up having a stroke and I thought that would change my urgency of care, but still I was dismissed by all of my providers. My cardiologist was very condescending and said my issues, specifically worsening issues, such as extreme chest pain, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, feeling a cold fluid feeling in my chest, my swollen abdomen and feet, and a hard cough, were just the result of stress and anxiety. I asked for an updated echocardiogram since I had one last year and much has change with my symptoms. I was denied and said an echo was absolutely not needed in my case. \n\nI went to my primary care who was also condescending and said it was anxiety. At the point of anger and tears I told her I felt like I\u2019m dying and I needed help. She said she was not a cardiologist but if it would help me feel better she would order an echocardiogram at the local hospital. \n\nMonday I had the echo. Wednesday I was diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease affecting both the mitral and tricuspid valves. There is still no urgency from my care team. I\u2019m being ignored by my PCP. My cardiologist gave a half-hearted \u201cwe\u2019ll request the echo records\u201d when I called them. I feel even worse. My chest pain now only ends when I feel a burst of fluid that feels like it fills my chest and neck. I\u2019m having trouble breathing all the time. But if I have a feeling if I traveled to the ER again, I\u2019d be dismissed right away just like I was before in pregnancy and earlier postpartum. I\u2019ve had this chest pain for months and especially when I was pregnant but for all the 6 times I went to Labor and Delivery I was discharged right away and never given an EKG or any cardiac work up. Same with my OB. \n\nSeparately, I\u2019m seeing a neurologist for my TIA. He\u2019s found something doing an EEG and multiple MRIs. He won\u2019t tell me the results until my follow up on 2 weeks but told me I absolutely cannot work or drive. \n\nI\u2019m truly at a loss of what to do. If I call the office I get attitude from both the nurses and receptionists. I can\u2019t even find good information on this disease because it seems like it\u2019s not common in developed countries. I live in the US, I\u2019m upper-middle class, I have always taken my full course of antibiotics when I\u2019ve had strep. I just don\u2019t understand how of the thousands and thousands of dollars I\u2019ve spent trying to get help over the past few months all I have to show for it is a permanent heart condition, a dead child, and no plan moving forward.",

How urgently do I need to see a doc?\nOther diagnoses: depression, ADHD, IBS, T2DM, hypertension\n\nInfrequent alcohol use (1-2 drinks/mo), vape nicotine, no drug use.\n\nI've played video games and worked on computers and screens my entire life. Never had any kind of photosensitivity or any seizure-like symptoms of any kind. Last night I was reading a book on my new Kindle Scribe and got a sudden **extreme** set of symptoms: intense deja vu, a kind of lucid dream-like state of mind, instantaneous sweats, extreme nausea, sense of impending doom. Stopped in what seems like maybe 10 seconds after putting the Kindle away. At first I thought maybe my blood pressure or sugar were off, but I checked and both were fine (BP a bit elevated but I'd imagine that's to be expected). Went back to reading thinking that was odd. Happened again after another 20 minutes or so. Didn't make sense to me but I put the Kindle down and did other stuff for a couple hours. Came back to it, and again it happened. Put the Kindle back down and haven't used it since, but had what felt like 1-2 very minor similar incidents while going to bed later.\n\nFinally started looking up symptoms and it feels exactly like the \"auras\" described associated with seizures. I didn't have any motor/muscular symptoms, but everything lines up. I called the only neurology clinics near me and they're all booked into December. Made an appointment anyway, but do I need to see a doc sooner? Maybe my GP? I've re-boxed the Kindle and will be returning it and staying away from them in the future. Is this the kind of thing that will get worse or that I need to treat now that it has happened?\n\nNote: I live alone. Kinda worried.",

Did I have a penis removed at birth?\nPrimary Concern: I have an unknown scar, and am paranoid if it is from a surgery shortly after my birth.\n\nAge: 18  \nSex: Female (?)  \nheight: 166cm (\\~5'6'')  \nweight: 48kg (106lbs)  \nrace: chinese\n\nI have a vertical scar that is a perfectly straight line from right below my bellybutton to my vaginal area (as far as I can tell). I think it would be classified as normotrophic? The scar's not raised or textured, but noticably darker and looks similar to when I get minor wounds and after they've completely closed up, but are still visible as temporary scars (lasting maybe a few months). \n\nI have had this scar for my whole life, have never had a surgery relating to anywhere on my torso or reproductive parts, and never sustained severe injuries in this region. My bellybutton has no irregular scarring or shaping, so I don't think it's a result of umbilical cord removal.\n\nHere's where the interesting stuff comes up. I was abandoned as an infant in China during the one-child policy. I have all the reproductive parts and functions of a female (breasts, periods, reproductive parts), and I am apathetic to my own gender expression. Because of this gender apathy, one time when I mentioned the mystery scar to my friend, they sarcastically said \"maybe you were a hermaphrodite and your chinese parents cut your penis off so that you'd get adopted.\" that sounds ridiculous, and I know that intersex people don't simply have both sets of genitalia (at least not fully functioning), but honestly in my mind it's not an impossibility, and I can't help but wonder if I am actually intersex, but my bio family or whoever was there for my birth, to remove any irregular genitals so that I would have a better chance at getting adopted. \n\nThere is a rumour that floats around the Chinese-Adoption sphere that sometimes abandoned children would have a strange and unique scar so that if need be in the future, the bio parents could identify their child. I've heard a lot of mixed things about the reality of this, but it is true that when I was adopted, I had a scar on my leg that looked like a messy burn scar from a metal brand. It stayed visible on me for the first 12 years of my life before eventually fading. In China, the orphanages usually house children with disabilities or birth defects more than any other demographic because \"normal\" babies are sent out for adoption (like what happened to me).\n\nMy current family doctor's earliest records of me are from when I started the immigration process, so the first year of my life has no medical record of what could have been done. It is also possible that my actual date of birth is incorrect since the orphanage assigned a predicted date when finding me abandoned. \n\nIn blood tests, I have the following irregularities:\n\n* elevated RBC\n* below average MCV\n* elevated triglycerides\n* extremely low ferritin\n\nMy doctor has diagnosed me with thalassemia, and other than that, I have no other official diagnosis or treatments. Is it actually possible that I was born interssex? If not, what could this scar be from?",

We have chosen not to become legally married but consider ourselves in a domestic partnership (I mention this to note that while i consider him my husband and am dedicated to him as such, I don\u2019t have the legal rights a legal spouse might have).\n\nBackground details about him: He is white (non-Hispanic) and we live in the USA. He is a 37-year-old cisgender man. He has had long-standing mental health problems (mostly extreme anxiety) since getting sepsis at age 14 which he barely survived. He used to be a heavy drinker before we got together but rarely drinks now. He also used to smoke cigarettes (about 8 a day) and marijuana, but for the past month has cut back on both considerably. He drinks about one energy drink w caffeine daily. He doesn\u2019t do any other recreational drugs. He is prescribed vyvanse, gabapentin, and viibryd for daily use and he *says* he\u2019s been taking them, but I strongly suspect based on the pills he has on hand and his behavior that he hasn\u2019t been for probably 1.5-2 months. He also was prescribed Xanax for occasional panic attacks (so not for daily use) but I don\u2019t think he has taken any in probably 2+ months. He hasn\u2019t seen his psychiatrist in months either. The past year or so was an extremely stressful year for him at work, with the worst occurring about mid-spring of this year, and it was definitely rough for him considering his mental health problems. \n\nCurrent problem: for the past two months he has been declining in every way. He hasn\u2019t showered in at least a month and will only occasionally use bathing wipes I bought for him. He stopped going to work and won\u2019t get a job. He lost his phone for several weeks and had no interest in finding it, so he had to get a new one. He doesn\u2019t spend any time with me and was incredibly rude to his family when they visited last week. He sleeps a lot and spends much of his waking hours in a daze. But most concerningly, he\u2019s become increasingly difficult to converse with. Half of what he says doesn\u2019t make any sense or is filled with non-sequiters. When we went out to eat with his family, he couldn\u2019t even order for himself because he was in a daze. He makes strange jokes and doesn\u2019t remotely understand why me and his parents are concerned. Nor does he understand why he lost his job or why finding a job would be important. We have begged him to see a doctor and he won\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d need to. My husband used to be an extremely hard-worker, always kept up to date on cleaning the house, showered daily, and was very intelligent. We loved watching movies together and playing board games. Now he\u2019s a completely different person and I miss him so much.\n\nHis parents live in another state and the only reason they came here this past week was because I told them I was becoming very concerned. When they visited they agreed that something is wrong, and as the visit progressed they started to suspect, as I do, that despite my partner\u2019s mental health history, this may be something more than a psychiatric problem. It is genuinely hard to describe unless you interact with him, but to us his behavior may indicate something is neurologically, or possibly hormonally, wrong beyond mental illness.\n\nI have reached a point where I have no idea what to do. I have been googling advice and everything tells me either 1) do nothing bc he can make his own decisions, even though I don\u2019t think he\u2019s mentally well enough to do so, or 2) have him admitted to a psych hospital. I am open to the 2nd option if needed, however he is not suicidal or threatening harm to himself or others so idk if it would be an option and regardless, I really think he should be given a full medical evaluation before defaulting to psychiatric hospitalization. But I also don\u2019t know if I would be able to have him admitted to a regular hospital since this may not be an \u201cemergency.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m panicking at this point y\u2019all. It\u2019s hard to work, hard to sleep, hard to eat. And financially we\u2019re hurting. I am so afraid I\u2019m not only losing my husband as a partner, but that he could possibly be really sick. His parents are also confused about what steps to take going forward. Please, I really need advice on what, if anything, I can do to help him. Sorry if this is long or confusing, I\u2019m frazzled at this point.",

(May 2022.) \n\n\\* Stepped on Rusty nail in filthiest shoes possible. Photo link below.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/vjtk4e8\n\nI am a teacher and I also enjoy woodworking. I am building a 'Buddy Bench' for our elementary school playground, and we have also been DIY renovating our home this entire summer. I managed to step on an extremely rusty nail that had been outside for weeks. This happened two days ago (on Wednesday.) I was changing the bit on my trim router without gloves (brilliant, I know) and then I clipped the side of my hand and started to bleed. I leaned over to grab a paper towel, tripped, hit the side of my house, bounced off of the siding, ran into the deck railing, and then somehow flipped over my bin of scrap wood/trim and dumped it all over and then landed straight on top of a piece of shoe molding with nails sticking straight up. I jammed my foot down pretty hard/suddenly and the nail blew straight through the sole of my garden boots and punctured a little more than 1/4 inch into my foot. It was enough to cause pretty sharp pain and I did have very minor bleeding. \n\nI went straight upstairs to my bathroom and my husband, who is on peritoneal dialysis here at home, grabbed a ton of his supplies and I immediately: \n\n1.) Washed my hands, put on gloves, and then washed the puncture wound with Hibiclens for about 2-3 minutes (we used a piece of gauze for this.) I let it sit for another minute and then rinsed it off. \n\n2.) New gloves, and then I opened a pair of surgical tweezers from a package and used these to remove a chunk of the sole of my boot from the wound. \n\n3.) Washed the wound again with Hibiclens. \n\n4.) Soaked gauze in the debriding/antimicrobial liquid called 'Except' that he uses to clean his exit site for his PD catheter. I let this sit on my foot for the suggested two minutes. \n\n5.) I applied his Gentamicin ointment to my foot and then covered with a silver alginate dressing and then closed it up with one of his island bandages. I put a new, clean sock on it and then went to urgent care pronto because I believe my last Tetanus shot was in 2013...I just wasn't sure and didn't want to take any chances at all. \n\nI let the P.A at the Urgent Care have a look and he said it definitely got me, but it sounded like I did a solid job cleaning it up initially. He didn't see any more shoe bits inside and put a clean bandage on it for me and then definitely agreed that I needed a tetanus booster, so we got that done and I left. \n\nHe didn't believe I needed any preventative antibiotics at that time but did tell me that if I noticed any signs of infection, increased pain, drainage, fever, etc...to come back immediately. \n\nVaccines can obviously cause you to feel gross for a day or two, and I started feeling like absolute crap last night. Body aches, fatigue, and a very, very sore foot, calf, thigh, and hip. I figured this is from limping/overcompensating and my muscles just hurt. It hurts to ball my foot up or move it much. \n\nMy question is this: Does this sound normal for this situation and is not giving a prophylactic antibiotic the right choice for me? I think the wound looks pretty good, but I'm not a medical professional so I don't trust my own assessment LOL.  I've been keeping it super clean and covered. I'm just worried about possible infection. I don't want/mean to be paranoid, I just don't want to develop any complications. As mentioned above...my husband already has ongoing health problems. We have two young children AND I'm a new teacher that's about to start back to work in two weeks. I do NOT want or need any problems that could have been prevented.\n\nThe P.A was a great guy and I trust him for the most part, I just wanted to see what someone else has to say about it. In the grand scheme of things, this isn't a very severe nail puncture wound, but what bothers me most is the pair of boots I had on. They are absolutely filthy and I have cleaned loads of cat litter, black mold, toilets, garages, been to the landfill repeatedly, and the list goes on. The thought of a chunk of the sole of those nasty things going into my foot (along with a rusty nail) just gives me the creeps :/ \n\nAs long as the wound looks OK and I am up to date on my Tetanus shot, I should be fine to just watch and wait, right? Please ease my mind. \n\n&#x200B;",

        "context": "Sinus pressure on palate after jaw surgery\nHi all,\n\nI am currently 32, male.  I am obese and take medications for blood pressure and anxiety.  I was born with an underbite and crossbite and so at approx. age 25 I started a two part orthognathic surgical process to correct this.  The first surgery, a SARPE (surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion) was uneventful, but the bone-borne palatal expander that was implanted in the roof of my mouth fractured a week after surgery (while being activated via the wrench provided) and was prematurely removed, while the doctors maintained the transverse width that I had achieved to that point and move forward with orthodontics in preparation for the second surgery.  The second surgery, a Le Fort I osteotomy, advanced the maxilla forward.  I then had several additional months of orthodontics.\n\nAfter the braces were removed it was clear that my crossbite remained, likely as a result of inadequate expansion of the maxilla because of the palatal expander failure.  I was recommended for a revision surgery which I had done in 2019.  The new surgeon removed the hardware (plates and screws) from the Le Fort I osteotomy and repeated the SARPE procedure from scratch.  \n\nAfter this repeat SARPE surgery, the upper right quadrant of teeth either shifted downward entirely or the teeth erupted downward and I suffered root resorption and gum recession on almost all right side maxillary as a result.  I also developed a burning sensation in the right side of the hard palate, and a sensation of fullness/inflation when I breathe through my nose.  If I perform a Valsalva maneuver and breathe into my nose I feel air pressure on almost all teeth on the right side of the maxilla (and not the left), and it feels as if something is \"inflating\" between my right-side hard palate/teeth and the floor of my right nostril.  Additionally, if I shift my mandible left to right it activates a sort of suction/popping that is both clearly audible but also felt in those same areas of the palate/nasal floor.  I do not believe this popping is coming from the jaw joints (TMJ).\n\nA recent CT scan at my periodontist showed fluid in the right maxillary sinus, but other than that my jaw surgeon (who did the revision) has offered no explanation, and neither has any orthodontist or the periodontist himself.  The periodontist has recommended seeing an ENT which I am doing next month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestions: \n\n1. Why did the right side of my maxilla/those teeth shift downward after the revision SARPE procedure?\n2. Why did the gums recede on those teeth at the same time as the downward shift?\n3. What is going on with the air pressure/popping/clicking in the palate/nasal floor?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy jaw surgeon has shrugged off my complaints and it has made me feel powerless over my own health.  Any advice is sincerely appreciated.",

Turns out that all of my issues I had during pregnancy, the cause of my son\u2019s stillbirth, and my chest pain and dizziness were all a result of Rheumatic Heart Disease.\n\nI ended up having a stroke and I thought that would change my urgency of care, but still I was dismissed by all of my providers. My cardiologist was very condescending and said my issues, specifically worsening issues, such as extreme chest pain, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, feeling a cold fluid feeling in my chest, my swollen abdomen and feet, and a hard cough, were just the result of stress and anxiety. I asked for an updated echocardiogram since I had one last year and much has change with my symptoms. I was denied and said an echo was absolutely not needed in my case. \n\nI went to my primary care who was also condescending and said it was anxiety. At the point of anger and tears I told her I felt like I\u2019m dying and I needed help. She said she was not a cardiologist but if it would help me feel better she would order an echocardiogram at the local hospital. \n\nMonday I had the echo. Wednesday I was diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease affecting both the mitral and tricuspid valves. There is still no urgency from my care team. I\u2019m being ignored by my PCP. My cardiologist gave a half-hearted \u201cwe\u2019ll request the echo records\u201d when I called them. I feel even worse. My chest pain now only ends when I feel a burst of fluid that feels like it fills my chest and neck. I\u2019m having trouble breathing all the time. But if I have a feeling if I traveled to the ER again, I\u2019d be dismissed right away just like I was before in pregnancy and earlier postpartum. I\u2019ve had this chest pain for months and especially when I was pregnant but for all the 6 times I went to Labor and Delivery I was discharged right away and never given an EKG or any cardiac work up. Same with my OB. \n\nSeparately, I\u2019m seeing a neurologist for my TIA. He\u2019s found something doing an EEG and multiple MRIs. He won\u2019t tell me the results until my follow up on 2 weeks but told me I absolutely cannot work or drive. \n\nI\u2019m truly at a loss of what to do. If I call the office I get attitude from both the nurses and receptionists. I can\u2019t even find good information on this disease because it seems like it\u2019s not common in developed countries. I live in the US, I\u2019m upper-middle class, I have always taken my full course of antibiotics when I\u2019ve had strep. I just don\u2019t understand how of the thousands and thousands of dollars I\u2019ve spent trying to get help over the past few months all I have to show for it is a permanent heart condition, a dead child, and no plan moving forward.",

I was sleeping in my mom's bed- she never actually slept in it but rather on the couch in our living room. I was by myself in the room and she came to wake me up on a school morning to get up and I told her I couldn't get up. She was, of course, doubtful, and told me to get up again, and I reiterated I literally couldn't get up. My legs could not move, and if I tried to force stimulation to get my legs to move I'd have immense pain in my thighs that felt like I had the weight of a Boeing 747 on me. My upper body was fine and I felt no pain up top. I was taken to the hospital and they ran a bunch of blood tests on me- nothing. They found literally nothing wrong and I went home. By 1pm that day I could walk just fine. No problems. \n\nHere's my question- what happened to me? I've had no lasting effects in the slightest and to this day me and my mom are still completely baffled by this. Happy to answer any questions I can.",

About 2 and a half months ago I had a mild cold with a sore throat and runny nose. Since then, I have had a constant feeling of globus sensation in my throat. I've been to the ENT specialist several times with this problem, but the doctor didn't see anything. (I did find out that I have tonsil stones, never noticed before, but I've had more out since). He prescribed Nasotasone first because he suspected it was an after effect of a cold. It did not help. I have no symptoms of reflux, no allergies that I know of, although I do get runny noses and sneezing occasionally, but not so often that I would think it was allergies. The SSRI has relieved the anxiety but the feeling of 'globus sensation' remains. I don't feel anything when eating/drinking, just simply when I swallow.   \nIt's driving me crazy. The last time the doctor asked me if I had any spinal problems (my back has hurt several times since the trauma, so maybe) or if i sleep on my stomach (yes). He is thinking of stress mainly, by the way.  \nWhat else do you think could be done, because I am slowly going crazy with this feeling, it is ruining my everyday life, I think if it was from stress then medication would have helped.   \nWhat should i try, where should i go?  \nThank you so much.\n\n&#x200B;",

Here is my issue:\n\nFor some time now, I have extreme fatigue and brain fog. It feels as though I am in a complete daze throughout the day. Almost as if I'm high sometimes. I try to take a nap on the couch sometimes because I am so tired, and this does make me feel better. This has been going on for some time now, but the thing is it only happens when I sleep in my room. When I sleep at someone else's house, on vacation, or in my room at college, I don't seem to have this issue. Even if I sleep for much less time than normal but it isn't in my room, I feel fine. I have come to determine it is an issue with sleeping in my room. I have noticed for some time, that when I lay down my nasal cavities swell up. I can literally barely breathe through my nose when laying down sometimes, but as soon as I sit up it goes back to normal. I read it may be an allergic reaction to dust mites, but I'm not sure why my nasal cavities would close nearly instantly and open nearly instantly depending on my orientation if that was the case. I have read that having breathing issues when sleeping can make you feel extremely tired throughout the day. I have an Apple Watch which states I am not getting very much deep sleep, but when I sleep in my college room the deep sleep goes up for some reason. Is this a form of sleep apnea?

Is it the sleep thats causing me to feel like this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nI believe my nasal cavities closing/swelling up when laying down is causing me to struggle to breathe when asleep, causing extreme fatigue throughout the day.

I was able to get up okay on my own, cleaned myself up, but found it hard to walk with some pain, and definitely stiffness. After a few days of resting, and seemingly having improved, I feel even more stif, finding it hard to walk normally, and the area seems a little swollen. It feels like a really tender bruise, that feels worse when I put pressure on it, but it doesn't hurt really bad. I guess I can't tell if my scraped skin is what's hurting, or if it's muscle issue I should be more concerned about. When I move my knee around it feels like cracking knuckles, but doesn't hurt. Also as a side note, even though I haven't experienced it thankfully, I'm a high risk for blot clotting and wonder if that's important information?\n\nTrying to set up an appointment with my doc, but it could take a while, so I thought I'd come ask for advice. Could I just be bruised up, or is it more likely some muscle issue, and is icing it up and resting the best solution for now?\n\nThanks:)",

Here is my issue:\n\nFor some time now, I have extreme fatigue and brain fog. It feels as though I am in a complete daze throughout the day. Almost as if I'm high sometimes. I try to take a nap on the couch sometimes because I am so tired, and this does make me feel better. This has been going on for some time now, but the thing is it only happens when I sleep in my room. When I sleep at someone else's house, on vacation, or in my room at college, I don't seem to have this issue. Even if I sleep for much less time than normal but it isn't in my room, I feel fine. I have come to determine it is an issue with sleeping in my room. I have noticed for some time, that when I lay down my nasal cavities swell up. I can literally barely breathe through my nose when laying down sometimes, but as soon as I sit up it goes back to normal. I read it may be an allergic reaction to dust mites, but I'm not sure why my nasal cavities would close nearly instantly and open nearly instantly depending on my orientation if that was the case. I have read that having breathing issues when sleeping can make you feel extremely tired throughout the day. I have an Apple Watch which states I am not getting very much deep sleep, but when I sleep in my college room the deep sleep goes up for some reason. Is this a form of sleep apnea? How can I fix this so I get better qulaity sleep? I read online flonase could help, which I luckily have in a cabinet and will begin trying to use. Are there any other suggestions? Is it the sleep thats causing me to feel like this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nI believe my nasal cavities closing/swelling up when laying down is causing me to struggle to breathe when asleep, causing extreme fatigue throughout the day.

I had symptoms that accompanied the lesions, primarily balance and dizziness, urinary incontinence, dysarthria, vitamin D and B12 deficiency, muscle weakness, and fatigue. \n\nI have had a brain MRI every year for the past 3 years, and a full spinal MRI 2 years ago. The brain MRI showed lesions 3 years ago and have remained unchanged since. The spinal MRI showed 0 lesions.\n\nI recently had a lumbar puncture that revealed 0 oligocolonal bands, which drops the chance of it being MS to 5%. I reevaluated my symptoms and had a bilateral xray of my hips done that revealed marked sclerosis of my sacroiliac joints, causing sacroiliitis. \n\nMany of my symptoms come and go in what feels like flares that can last from days to weeks. I had a particularly bad flare in January of this year and began medication afterwards to help manage symptoms. Prior to the flair I was only taking a multivitamin.\n\nSome markers that suggest to me that it may be Lupus instead is:\n\n* I tested positive on my ANA \n\n* I tested positive for my dsDNA\n\n* I have low creatinine levels\n\n* I have protein in my urine\n\n* I have a sudden abundance of petechiae with unknown cause, primarily in areas that are exposed to sunlight - specifically my chest and forearms\n\n* Bright lights cause my eyes to hurt and a headache\n\n* Joint pain, stiffness, and tenderness in my left leg and knee. \n\n* Itchy scalp, and sensation of bugs crawling under my skin - no rash or dry skin present \n\n* Insomnia overcome only by trazadone\n\n* Wicked night sweats.

I woke up with terrible dizziness, nausea, stomach pain and had diarrhea on the toilet right after. Never had this before. The nausea and stomach ache disappeared around 9 to 11 am. I had a very hard time getting anything down for breakfast, was constantly retching while eating, but without throwing up. I mostly had \u201cnormal consistency\u201d- stool in the afternoon. When I was able to sleep in I had almost no pain and normal stool consistency.\n\nThis went on like that, until November, when I switched my ADHD meds over to Elvanse. Things immediately got better, mainly the pain and the nausea. They were still there, but not nearly as bad. Yes, I know, I should probably have talked to a doctor at that point.

This wakes me up every day now, I\u2019m not able to sleep in anymore. My stomach feels completely normal. However as soon as I\u2019m done having the bowel movement the pain starts. It\u2019s not constant, more like waves, worse on some days, better on other days. It lasts for 1-2 hours, then disappears and very rarely returns in the afternoon.

My appetite also isn\u2019t as big as it once was, although I attribute this to the marijuana.\n\nThere also are those very rare (once or twice a month) days where I don\u2019t have any pain at all and my morning bowel movement goes as smooth as it possibly could. I was not able to link this to any specific diet or behavior on the previous day, it seems to just happen at random.\n\nSomething interesting I noticed:\nWhen I don\u2019t smoke marijuana I have very thin diarrhea and quite a lot of flatulence, when I smoke the flatulence disappears and my diarrhea becomes a little more firm, although it kinda seems \u201cairy\u201d, as if the gas previously excreted with the flatulence is now incorporated into the stool.\n\nAny ideas as to why this could be are greatly appreciated!\nMy suspicion is that the Medikinet somehow destroyed my intestinal flora.",

I have been a hard worker since 16 years old, put myself through college, ate healthy, 5\u20199\u201d, 130lbs, ran 5-10 miles/day, often on sand. I didn\u2019t have any major health issues other than very heavy, often long, menstrual cycles from endometriosis and ovarian cysts. I have led a fairly good life until a few years ago.\n\nI was not able to have children due to endometriosis and adenomyosis, so I had a total hysterectomy on 09/05/2020 (in NYC at one of the best hospitals at the height of COVID. My surgeon was department head, so I imagine that\u2019s the only reason it was approved). \n\nSince then, my health has rapidly declined. I have cervical spinal stenosis, moderate osteoarthritis in thoracic and lumbar regions, went from size 2 to 12 in 16 months, developed hypothyroidism (my thyroid was frequently tested for HYPERthyroidism due to how thin I was until I was 43), major depressive disorder, panic disorder, severe migraines (at least 1-2/week, vomiting if I move, can\u2019t keep down liquids). Because of this, I\u2019m not able to work. My neurologist has prescribed every medication; nothing works. The last resort is (Botox). It has been over two months and the person in charge of authorizations hasn\u2019t even contacted my insurance company.\n\nA recent MRI showed smooth dura thickening over the left hemisphere of my brain. According to my neurologist, it\u2019s very thick and only on the entire left hemisphere. She spoke with colleagues (there is apparently a reality show about how these are the best neurologists in New York). No one has seen it before and therefore, don\u2019t know the cause. My neurologist said we\u2019d repeat the MRI in six months and go from there. I said absolutely not; it is my brain. I am scared to death, particularly when no one knows what it is or causing it. She agreed to three months. This was 06/07. Even though she doesn\u2019t know what it is, she\u2019s somehow certain it isn\u2019t related to my migraines. \n\nMy bloodwork has been coming back wonky, but the one constant is low platelets, so my PCP referred me to a hemo-oncologist. My results are on the portal; thrombocytopenia and Pseudothrombocytopenia. \n\nDoes anyone have any idea what the MRI or blood results could possibly mean? I\u2019m not going to scare the hell out of myself and google for info, but I\u2019m freaking out. I am afraid because I don\u2019t have great insurance, I\u2019m not a priority.

Currently presenting with symptoms indicative of partial SBO and consistent with prior pattern of high grade SBO formation. \n\nMy doctor has advised me that my current symptoms are consistent with another problematic adhesion forming and ordered me to stick to a rigid low residue diet indefinitely, with the assumption that I will eventually likely need further surgical intervention if it progresses to complete SBO. \n\nMy general question is what is the long term viability of a jpouch if this pattern continues? From my understanding,  repeated laparotomies every 1-2 years will only continue to make the situation with adhesions exponentially worse. Is there anything that could be done non-operatively to help prevent further repeated laparotomies from adhesion-related SBO? \n\nAlso, I couldn't seem to find a clear answer in the literature: if further operations and adhesions are more or less guaranteed either way, could I be any better off returning to a permanent ileostomy?   I've tried to research the rates of SBO after ileostomy vs ipaa, but there doesn't seem to be a clear consensus and little research specifically on the ileostomy side of it to begin with. \n\nI realize it may be a dumb question, but figure it can't hurt to ask since I am willing to try almost anything if it improves my quality of life. I feel like my life is currently just alternating between recovering from abdominal surgery or suffering the pain of recurrent partial SBO that eventually ends in abdominal surgery and it is not a sustainable way to live.

I sent a pic of the tick to an ID service (and did some research), and it was a female dog tick that had been feeding for approx 3 days. She was able to pull it off, but it took a bit of skin with it. Yesterday, she noticed a bump behind her ear, and I saw that the two lymph nodes behind her ear (about 2\u201d down from the bite) are swollen. They\u2019re rubbery and every so slightly tender, but not super painful. The lower one is about the size of a pencil eraser and the upper one is smaller, but still enlarged. They definitely were not there a week or so ago, I was helping her put earrings in last week and would have noticed. The actual bite spot is a little crusty and was quite red when she pulled it off, but it\u2019s not too irritated now. Just a little scab. The tick was on there for about 3 days, though. \nWe live in a Lyme-heavy area, but this type of tick doesn\u2019t transmit Lyme, so I wasn\u2019t overly concerned, but now I\u2019m not sure if she should take prophylactic antibiotics in case it\u2019s another tick-borne illness. Her doc is not concerned and said the bite and the nodes or could not be related but also that tick bites don\u2019t typically cause swollen nodes (though I\u2019ve read differently). Any thoughts? Could a scalp bite cause the postauricular nodes to swell just due to the irritation, or is it worth it to pursue abx?",

My cardiologist was very condescending and said my issues, specifically worsening issues, such as extreme chest pain, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, feeling a cold fluid feeling in my chest, my swollen abdomen and feet, and a hard cough, were just the result of stress and anxiety. I asked for an updated echocardiogram since I had one last year and much has change with my symptoms. I was denied and said an echo was absolutely not needed in my case. \n\nI went to my primary care who was also condescending and said it was anxiety. At the point of anger and tears I told her I felt like I\u2019m dying and I needed help. She said she was not a cardiologist but if it would help me feel better she would order an echocardiogram at the local hospital. \n\nMonday I had the echo. Wednesday I was diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease affecting both the mitral and tricuspid valves. There is still no urgency from my care team. I\u2019m being ignored by my PCP. My cardiologist gave a half-hearted \u201cwe\u2019ll request the echo records\u201d when I called them. I feel even worse. My chest pain now only ends when I feel a burst of fluid that feels like it fills my chest and neck. I\u2019m having trouble breathing all the time. But if I have a feeling if I traveled to the ER again, I\u2019d be dismissed right away just like I was before in pregnancy and earlier postpartum. I\u2019ve had this chest pain for months and especially when I was pregnant but for all the 6 times I went to Labor and Delivery I was discharged right away and never given an EKG or any cardiac work up.

It moves independent of the skin, and doesn\u2019t appear noticeable visually.  It doesn\u2019t hurt when I palpate it.  This is on the outside of the jaw, just below the earlobe.  Admittedly, it may have been there for some time and I\u2019ve just never noticed it before.  There\u2019s no similar structure that I can feel on the left side.  I\u2019m guessing based on location that perhaps this is a swollen lymph node.  No other lymph nodes below the jawline or anywhere else are noticeable as far as I can tell, and I don\u2019t feel sick or feverish.\n\nDoes the location make sense for a lymph node, outside of the mandible?  Is this something to be concerned about at all?  Should I expect this to subside in the near future, or what should I do if it doesn\u2019t?  If it is something of concern, is this something I can be seen for in a few weeks at a PCM, or is it worthy of a more immediate checkout?",

No cigarettes/e-cigs. Usually smokes marijuana but he's on a break. Currently on Prozac for anxiety. No other existing medical conditions.\r  \n\r  \nHe started developing a small rash on his left eyelid about 3 weeks ago. It started mostly as a sensation, he said that he could feel something but nothing was visible. Then very small skin-colored bumps started forming. He was hoping it would get better on its own since it mostly looked like maybe some skin irritation - we had been out in the sun a lot. Then the bumps started getting more red and well-defined. We went to Urgent Care where they prescribed a topical steroid that we can't remember the name of and they told him to see an eye doctor if it gets worse. Well, it got worse, so he saw an ophthalmologist on Monday (7/17) who prescribed him the valacyclovir but never actually told him what he thought it was. It was a \"try this, let me know if it doesn't work\" sort of deal.\r  \n\r  \nThis morning we woke up and it's spread more to his eyelid, it's almost like it's following the hollow around the outside of the eye. He says it hurts. The bumps are also more red today, but they don't appear to be filled with anything. His actual eyeball is unaffected.\r  \n\r  \nHe tested positive for HSV1 in the past as part of a general screen but has never had an outbreak. We were suspecting HSV1 but we aren't sure anymore since it seems to be getting worse even with the valacyclovir. We are sexually active. I've never been tested for either HSV strain but I've never had an outbreak (which I realize doesn't mean I'm not a carrier).\r  \n\r  \nHe is waiting for a call back from the ophthalmologist so we do have IRL medical attention in process but in the meantime we're getting concerned and want answers sooner rather than later.

Its quite constant except when i first wake up. It is not painful, i have self examined my testicles to the best of my abilities and they both feel the same despite the sizes being a little different. It sort of feels like my testicle is getting sucked up, thats how i would describe it.\n\nNot sure what it is, but do you have any ideas?",

Can feel twinges of pain when I try bending at the hip and lifting my left knee to a 90 degree angle. Also in bed can feel twinges when I rotate from back/side/front.\n\nAny idea what it is and/or possible remedies? I got an adjustable bed recently but I don\u2019t think that could cause this pain except maybe using lumbar support too long when I shift to sleeping on my side? I also don\u2019t remember banging my hip across a table etc recently except maybe my dog jumping on me (I\u2019m pretty good at catching him most of the time)\n\nIf it helps I\u2019m in my young 20s and work from home at a desk (I have one of those electric ones but I tend to sit most of the day)\n\n23, 5\u20193\u201d, 180 lbs, female, no smoking nor previous medical issues except being overweight - lmk if other info is needed",

I've been having for a few days now random like chest tightness or maybe even like a sharp pain in center of chest on mostly my left side but sometimes right as well. Not painful but noticeable and Only lasts a few seconds and happens maybe 10 or more times a day while I'm sitting, laying down, walking. It first started maybe 5 months ago and would happen when I vaped. It happened consistently enough that I quit vaping and switched to mouth nicotine pouches. shortly after quitting the vape the pain went away. Now the past few days its back but not quite as strong. I don't drink but I do take kratom twice daily which is legal where I'm from. Maybe anxiety related but I don't think I'm all that anxious.\n\nEDIT: No family history of heart disease.",

I never got tested for HSV1 until recently due to mistakes I've made years ago. I tested for all STDs this week and got negative for all but this one.\n\nI was wondering if it was possible to test if you had oral or genital. Reason I'd like to know is due to having symptoms that would make you think you had genital such as burning pee (not as often) or itching (often).

My proximal phalanx of my right middle finger hurts most and almost always lately.\n\n\nHave been losing weight intermittently since june 2022, around -12 kg max. went from 1.76 and 70kg to about 58. Very low muscle mass. Stopped having sex  since August 2022 (breakup with long term partner) and my periods have become irregular around that time, following it it seems. Seemingly acquired asexuality and disinterest in love in the past couple of months, I have always lacked in this aspect but I can tell I have completely drifted away from that whole concept of sexuality.\n\nMy life has been getting way better since I stopped having periods, at first I had some terrible anxiety episodes like I never experienced, and overall bad mental health out of nowhere, terrible ups and downs. But after a few weeks I was more stable than ever and thrived and I still do. Problem is I have begun getting these bone symptoms which I figured might be due to my possible lack of estrogen. \n\nBigger problem at the moment: I have always had weird bones, had an inflamed sternum at some point a few months ago but I evaluated it and it all seemed fine. Yesterday I looked in the mirror and noticed I have a weird shape to my ribcage, realized I have a whole hole in my chest, exact definition of pectus excavatum. But I am fairly certain I didn't have it before, despite my ribcage flare and scoliosis+hyper lordosis+cyphosis. The hole hurts when I press on it.\n\nI was wondering if it's possible to have become accentuated just now, or if I could have literally acquired it due to my hormonal imbalances. If you have longer explanations I'm all for it. Will finally be seeing an endocrinologist sometime these weeks.",
