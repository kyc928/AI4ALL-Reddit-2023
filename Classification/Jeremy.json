I recently had what appeared an ingrown hair starting to form on the base of my penis shaft. After a couple of days, the bump resembled a pimple and I popped it leading me to an urgent care visit to ensure everything was okay and rule out possible sti exposure. The doctor prescribed me an antibiotic to control infection for 10 days, which I took through yesterday. I was also tested for trich/ghon/chla and tested negative for all. \n\nA few days after the doctor, I did notice a hair growing under the skin of the irritated area and was able to easily remove most of the hair without digging into my skin. Afterwards I kept taking the antibiotic and the skin is no longer raised however I do appear to have a small lesion where the skin looks to still be healing. \n\nFast forward to yesterday, I noticed the skin still healing and decided to try applying some cortisone cream and a band aid to promote the healing.. I woke up this morning and the area seems to be worse, visibly more red and it appears another hair growing out appears to be red and also appearing as a lesion..\n\nI am slightly paranoid but just wondering if I should get a second opinion on this being related to an sti or if this looks like a continuation of irritated skin due to my hair? Lastly the initial bump started a few days after shaving. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/qtTyy3A.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/79bmj4R.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/aVeix9c.jpg",

So he prescribed the same antibiotics for another week. It\u2019s my last dose today, there are tons of improvement, no more neck pain and pain when swallowing. And so, i decided to finally touch and inspect my neck (I decided to not touch it until meds are finished because of anxiety). Tada! It\u2019s still there, its inside my neck (left side), although its smaller now and painless. Is this normal or is there a downtime for it to be gone after the medication? Will it ever go away and shrink into nothingness overtime?

Once a month since April I have been breaking out in a red, painful rash in my armpit fold just on one side of my body. I was given clobetosol cream to use twice a day for four days the first and second times I experienced the rash. The third time I was given a shot of hydrochortisone. It appears that the rash is coming back for a fourth time. I have not changed laundry detergent, deoderant, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc. and all products that I use are hypoallergenic. At past appointments my dermatologist does not seem concerned with helping me diagnose what's causing this--he said since it responds to steroids that's all he was concerned with. I am hoping to get an appointment and push for some kind of biopsy or something besides just another shot. I don't even know if it's too early to have another shot (previous shot was June 19). This is really aggravating (both because it's painful and depressing that it keeps coming back). What are some possible causes that I can investigate with my dr.?

        "context": "(25M) More than six months of diarrhea, loose stools, and nausea. I need help.\nHello, \n\nI would like to ask for your help or advice. I have never had any problems with my stomach or digestion, even though I sometimes went to the bathroom more frequently, usually due to stress, stool was normal. However, this is a different case. At the end of November 2022, one morning, I woke up with diarrhea and spent the whole day sitting on the toilet. The stool was completely watery, and I had never experienced anything like this before. The next day, I felt better, but in the following days, I still had loose and watery stools. Whenever I ate something, within a few minutes, my stomach started rumbling, and I had to go to the bathroom again. The same thing happened when I was lying flat on my bed, with an awful rumbling sensation in the upper part of my stomach the whole time.\n\nIn the following week, I also started experiencing mouth nausea and a feeling of vomiting, despite I never vomited. I woke up in the morning already feeling nauseous and had to rush to the toilet, just like before, with watery stools. I must mention that during the time these problems started, I had, and still have, psychological issues (depression, due to other matters), and at that time, I was taking a combination of antidepressants, which I changed in various ways after consulting with a psychiatrist, so I initially attributed it to that. Continuing on... In December, I underwent routine examinations with my doctor, such as blood tests and stool tests, and then I had an ultrasound, but everything was fine. However, the symptoms persisted into the new year; it was terrible, with constant nausea, a persistent feeling of vomiting in my mouth, and pain in the upper abdomen. Eventually, I went to see a gastroenterologist, where in January, they conducted all possible tests and examinations, including gastroscopy and colonoscopy, but everything came back without the slightest finding or problem.  \n\n\nOne note, the gastroscopy was incredibly difficult for me, as I constantly felt nauseous in my mouth (sensing it somewhere behind my tongue, at the beginning of my throat). I had an intense urge to vomit, and after the gastroscopy, I struggled for several weeks with significant stomach pain and diarrhea, similar to the beginning. The nausea was immense, just dreadful. A week later, I had a colonoscopy, and despite a one-day cleansing with laxatives and the like, my intestines were completely contaminated with watery stool (I saw it on the camera).\n\nTo summarize the gastrological aspect, all my results were normal, and the doctor didn't know what was wrong with me, so he prescribed some pills containing mix of: Calcium carb, Codein, Papavereni, Sacharin Albi, Miscle fiat pulvis. I took them in the morning and evening, and although they made my stool firmer, it still looked bad (yellowish color) and had a strange smell. Moreover, they caused increased nausea in my mouth. In the meantime, in April, when I had had enough of everything, I decided, with the doctor's agreement, to stop taking all antidepressants completely and cleanse my body. I felt slightly better, but it probably wasn't the cause. I was frustrated, so I made an appointment with an infectious disease specialist, and I got tested for all possible viruses, sexually transmitted diseases, and even things like HIV, hepatitis, and so on, but everything came back negative.\n\nI forgot to mention, at the end of January, I noticed (until then, I had never looked at it) that I had a terribly thick, white coating on my tongue, and it has been there for six months now. I thought it could be candidiasis, as I had previously been diagnosed with it from swabs on my penis, but this time I had swabs taken from my throat and tongue, and the finding was negative. I also read that e-coli bacteria can cause watery diarrhea, but I don't believe they would miss detecting it in my tests.\r  \n\r  \nBasically, I'm currently lost and desperate. It's not as bad as it was at the beginning, but I constantly feel either nauseous, have loose stools, or experience pain in the upper part of my stomach. It seems to me that everything I eat is processed in my stomach instantly and moves on. It's like an extremely accelerated metabolism, and I never feel emptied.  \n\r  \nThe stool is colored yellow and has an unnatural smell. No complications with the gallbladder or pancreas were found. Recently, I was examined for immunology, and milk intolerance was detected, but I don't think it had an impact on this issue. Additionally, some weakened immune cells were identified, and I have started taking Imunor. For the past few months, I have been regularly consuming probiotics and various combinations of vitamins, without success. I tried changing my diet, but it doesn't seem to have any effect. Simply put, since the end of November, something has completely changed in my digestion; my stomach feels heavy within half an hour after eating, and so on.\n\nIf you have any further questions or if there's anything else you're interested in, I'll respond to everything in the comments.\r  \n\n\nThank you for reading..\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\n\n&#x200B;",

It was a small amount, there was some partly digested food. \n\nI was checked out in the ambulance and they told me I had no serious signs of infection.

This past weekend my fatigue and body aches hit a high and I wasn't really able to do much - I had to leave a hangout with friends because moving was really sucky on my muscles, and I even went to the ER at like 3am on Saturday due to chest pain and neck pain (they suggested it was just muscle tension/aches and not cardiac or lung issues).\r  \n\r  \nThen, this morning I had my cup of coffee and went to work. Had a pretty intense BM (the kind that makes your intestines cramp). Nothing in the bowl before I went - afterwards, I look in and see some sort of string-like thing. Photo is here - [https://imgur.com/a/blROx0i](https://imgur.com/a/blROx0i) There were two of these total, but the other was like, embedded in the BM so I didn't feel comfortable getting a photo of that...possibly an oversight on my part. Worried it's like a worm or a bit of my intestinal lining?\r  \n\r  \nI see my PCP on Wednesday for a checkup, and I'm definitely going to bring it up - I just want to know what to emphasize or what else I should mention that I may not have considered.\r  \n\r  \n(Unrelated but potentially important? I've been having unusual vaginal discharge - strange odor and consistency, itching and burning every so often. I'm hoping to schedule a women's health appointment, but I'm wondering if there's a connection. TIA!)\n\n&#x200B;",

The covid symptoms I had at this point were fever, sore throat, mild cough, and body aches. I took DayQuil sometime before bed.  \nI woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. I was really tired so I sat down to pee. While I was sitting, my hands and feet suddenly got very cold. Like extremely cold, not chilly from a draft. It felt like ice was creeping up my limbs. My hearing went very muffled and my ears were ringing, my vision started to tunnel, and I was dizzy. My hands and feet were tingling. My chest felt really tight and my stomach was cramping. I managed to get up and wake up my mom (she was visiting and we ended up having to quarantine together). I told her something felt very very wrong. She called 911. I laid down. By the time the paramedics got there, those symptoms mostly had gone away and I was feeling slightly better. They took my vitals. My heart rate was a little fast, my blood pressure slightly lower than my normal but still in an okay range, I had a very low fever, and my O2 was 97. Since all of that was fine, I declined going to the hospital.  \nI've taken DayQuil many times before with no issues. However, once when I was a teenager, I took NyQuil while I was sick and something really similar happened. I went to the bathroom, suddenly felt really off (ears muffled and ringing, nauseated, cold and tingly, tunnel vision), got up and started walking back to my bedroom and fainted.  \nI always assumed then I had a bad reaction to something in the NyQuil, so I only ever took just DayQuil after that. Am I allergic to something? Is something messing with my breathing, blood pressure, or blood sugar levels?

I went to the airport,entered the plane. When the pilot announced takeoff, I suddenly couldn't breathe properly. I had travelled with plane 7-8 times, so this was a first to me. I lost control of myself and told the hostess that I wanted to get off the plane immediately. They first asked if there was a doctor among the passengers, luckily, there was one, unlucky for me, she couldn't help me. I grabbed my luggage and rushed outside the airport, but i was still gasping. Went to the train, still gasping. I was gasping the whole 1 hour ride. I didn't want to go home, asked my friend if I could stay over, she agreed. I was still gasping and at that point, it was fucking annoying. I stayed there for 3 days, had a panic attack on the second day of my visit, felt fucking ashamed that I was weak and troubled my friend. I left after that day, took a bus, still gasping. I was about to collapse on my way to home, but I told myself that if I make it to the house,it'll be okay. It wasn't okay at all. I realized that I can't even go outside anymore. I've been staying at home for 2 weeks now,and it feels fucking awful,like a new kind of low.

The constant tinnitus is in both ears, though the left ear is often louder and sometimes has an additional tone.\n\n**Details about the pulsatile tinnitus:** The tinnitus is usually constant, but becomes pulsatile when I:\n\n* **Bend over** \\- I'll get about 5 seconds of pulse-synchronous whooshing in both ears. It's not a low-pitched ultrasound noise, it's like my hissing tinnitus pulsing along to my heart (ssssSSSSsssSSSssSSSsssSSS)\n* **Stand up quickly** \\- Again, about 5 seconds of pulse-synchronous whooshing in both ears\n* **Turn my head all the way to the right** \\- Same, about 5 seconds of the whooshing\n\nIf I maintain the positions above, after the 5-ish seconds, the pulsing stops and the tinnitus hisses normally, non-pulsatile. If I'm upset, it can take longer.\n\nOther times it is pulsatile is doing hard cardio **exercise**... this is when it pulses the most, I hear 3-5 seconds of whooshing (both ears) on every other exhale when my heart rate is raised and pumping hard. Otherwise, I feel GREAT when I exercise, my heart rate recovers quickly when I stop, no headaches or weakness, etc.\n\nSometimes, I hear the pulsing inside my tinnitus when I first wake up in the morning, or when I wake up from a vivid dream. This can sometimes take a little while to calm down and is sometimes louder, or only, in the left ear.\n\nThe constant tinnitus is extremely somatic. I can make it louder by turning my head to the right, bending my neck all the way back, pushing on my forehead, jutting my jaw out, etc. I can even 'fake' the exact sound it makes when it's actually pulse-synchronous by doing these movements... the sound is the same.\n\n**The weirdest thing:** during the times the tinnitus is pulsing, I can STOP the pulsing by closing my teeth together. I CANNOT stop the pulsing by pressing anywhere on my neck or throat (I know that's a common test for vascular PT)  I also cannot make a recording of the pulsing, which tells me it is probably a subjective noise and not 'real'.\n\n**Duration of Complaint:** 2-3 years, I don't know exactly, but it's been going on for quite a long time.\n\n**Factors to Consider:** I have a history of going to air shows and concerts without ear protection. I also used to work wedding receptions. For the last several years I have been using AirPods on my 6-7 mile daily walks, and I definitely had the music up way too loud to hear over traffic/outside noise. I know this is why I have the constant tinnitus. What I don't understand is why it is sometimes pulsatile. I protect my hearing now.\n\n**Tests I have had:**\n\n* **Brain MRI, with and without contrast, with IAC protocol:** totally clear and 'normal'\n* **Blood tests:** not anemic, liver and kidney function fine, thyroid levels are normal. Vitamin levels were not tested.\n* **Blood Pressure:** runs low if anything, has never been elevated when measured\n* **Hearing Test:** All thresholds normal, symmetrical hearing, including some extended high frequencies tested\n* **LDL/Tympanometry:** Normal LDLs and normal pressures\n* **Vestibular tests:** found a slight unilateral hypofunction on the RIGHT side, which is my 'better' tinnitus ear.. test was done to diagnose 24/7 rocking dizziness for a few months post-COVID infection. I've since 'compensated' for this and no longer feel dizzy.\n* **Chest CTA/EKG/Echocardiogram:** These were done last month because of a bad septic pneumonia infection, not because of the pulsatile tinnitus, but everything was perfect so I'm including it here just to mention that there probably isn't a cardiac concern.\n* **Eye Exam:** included digital images of my optic nerves, no papilledema seen\n\nI never cared about the noise before until I started being anxious about it, but now it causes me a great deal of anxiety and I listen to it constantly. I feel like I can habituate to it again if I could remove the anxiety that something is really wrong, since Googling 'pulsatile tinnitus' leads you down some scary rabbit holes, which is why I started seeking a doctor to begin with.\n\nI've been seeing an ENT/Neurotologist specialist, who I thought would be the best person for this due to his hyper-specialty but he seems unconcerned about my specific symptoms? I had to push for even the standard contrast brain MRI. He thinks if my PT was anything super concerning it would only ever appear in one ear and would be a more constant 24/7 thing.\n\nI think all of you doctors on here are so generous with your time and expertise, and I'm hoping you can give me some basic advice... **with my specific symptoms should I just put this to rest, or should I be seeking more scans ( brain MRA or carotid ultrasound?) And how urgently should I be seeking this out?**\n\n**Major Concerns:** a dural arteriovenous fistula, carotid cavernous fistula, or an aneurysm. I know the scan that I had wouldn't be able to fully diagnose those things, but would it at least raise any red flags that would give my doctor reason for further testing?\n\nI'm really, really struggling with the anxiety. It's led me to restart Prozac after saying, years ago, that I'd never go back on another SSRI.",

But when I was 15 I took 47 coricidin cough and cold pills and was not breathing by the time EMS arrived. I was intubated for about three weeks and once I began being able to breathe on my own it was clear I was in some form of psychosis. I was ripping IV's out, biting nurses, running down the halls and a lot more crazy shit. My dad recorded some of these breakouts and its actually horrifying to see because for me it is all black. I don't remember any of it. I simply took the pills and woke up 2 months later in a mental hospital confused as shit. I believe I had dextromethorphan toxicity. Anyway fast forward 6 months and I had my first seizure. I have grand Mal seizures where I full on flop. They usually last about 2 minutes and my Husband (he saw my first seizure and pretty much every one since then) says that before I start full on seizing I become real quiet and look up to my left. After doing all of the tests (sleep test, EEG & MRI) my neurologist explain to me that there was a lesion in my brain with secretions firing off and if they fire off at the right time I have a seizure. Then more recently I had a newer MRI done where my neurologist said there was only a tiny possible lesion? I dont understand how it would get smaller? I still have seizures if I do not take my medication. I actually think I have more now because if I miss one dose Ill have a seizure, whereas as a teenager I was shit about taking my medications and did not have near as many seizures. \n\nSo my questions is could my lesion be shrinking and if so would my seizures stop?

I am writing this post as recently it has been getting worse and she is not able to handle it any longer (both physically and mentally), and seems like no doctor so far has been able to help us. It started as sporadic events (once every few days) that procured an itching feeling in what seem like random parts of the body. Recently, these events have become more and more frequent, up to a few times a day, which we have been calling \"crisis\". During these crisis, my mom feels a pungent painful itching feeling that puts her through a lot of pain and gives her no peace, as a consequence she gets quickly agitated, her breathing gets faster and she gets what looks like a panic attack. The itching feeling currently seems to be on her legs most times, but it can move throughout her legs and body during one single crisis. In addition, it seems like in the past few weeks she also has a general constant overall itching feeling all over the body at all times in addition to these events, which is not as bad as the crisis, but is still bothering her.\n\nSo far, there seems to be no cream or medicine that alleviates her symptoms or stops the crisis whatsoever.\n\nWhen she takes showers, she can only use cold water, as warm water makes her itching worse and at times even start the itching. Taking cold showers used to be a way to make her feel better, but now it is not even an option as things got worse.\n\nMy mom is overall healthy, she has always maintained a very healthy lifestyle, she eats well, she is physically active, she does not smoke and does not abuse alcohol (just a glass of wine every other day). No recreational drugs of any kind. She works as a flight attendant, thus she is often flying internationally and as a consequence her sleeping schedule is not perfect, but she has managed to live her life balanced as this has been her job for 25+ years. She has Factor V Leiden received from both parents, which to my understanding causes her blood to coagulate. She takes heparin for this problem, especially when traveling, and we believe that Factor V Leiden has most likely been the cause to many miscarriage. She has been pregnant to full-term three times, I am the only one that has survived. Around 8-10 years ago she had a uterine fibroid removed of around 6/7cm. Last year, she had a melanoma on the back of her arm, which has been successfully removed.\n\nShe has been visiting several doctors about the itching problem, and no one seems to be able to identify a cause for this problem, and no one is able to tell us how to alleviate her pain in the meantime.\n\nShe has seen several dermatologists. Most of them said it might be dry skin (which personally seemed strange), so they prescribed her some moisturizing cream, but that has not helped at all. Other dermatologists said it might be allergies to some ingredients in shampoo or soap, so they advised her to switch to more neutral brands and schedule an appointment with an allergist.\n\nSo, we went to several allergists. The allergists made her do a prick test, as well as other tests such allergy test to combination of substances, and allergy DNA testing. Everything came back negative, except the DNA test said she might be subject now or in the future to celiac disease or intolerance to gluten, but the other tests showed that currently she is not affected by gluten.\n\nShe has tried several types of diets according to what some physicians recommended. Each diet lasted for the duration of 6 months each, to understand if the allergy test did not produce a good outcome. She firstly tried to avoid gluten for 6 months, then avoided lactose, then avoided everything derived from cows (including beef and milk etc.). Nothing made a difference.\n\nIn the meantime, allergists have prescribed antihistamine to take during her \"crisis\", but it seems like these are not alleviating any symptoms. She feels a bit of relief abound 1h/1h30m after she takes the antihistamine, which according to the doctor should be almost instant.\n\nShe had her blood work done with a lot of parameters tested (also for liver and kidneys), and nothing is out of place. She also had an all-body \"everything ultrasound\" taken, which also checked in detailed her liver and her kidneys. Everything is fine (even perfect), nothing abnormal.\n\nShe also visited a neurologist, but the doctor excluded any associations with that field. \n\nWe have hit a wall, we do not know what to do. I am not looking for a diagnosis, I am looking for a piece of advice: what to do, who we should talk to. Nothing seems to help my mom feel relief from this pungent painful itching. Please let me know if I should provide further details. \n\nI thank you all for your time.",

During some of the other tests they found the genetic marker that my family may be predisposed to getting cancer. So the genetics doctor recommended my sister and I to get tested. My sister (40) she was able to get her test booked no problem.  \n\nMy current doctor has been on mat leave so I was assigned another doctor. I literally just don't know what to do or if what my doctor is doing is correct. I went in with a list of issues I wanted to look at, told scheduling the list. I'll spare the details essentially I was told to get out of my first appointment because my 10 minutes had been up and they couldnt spare any additional time... I had to wait almost 2 hours to see them for 10 minutes. I barely scratched my requests and to see the doctor for everything I had to book 4 visits.... \n\n- My genetics apparently was denied for testing. I finally got the doctor to send the request on visit 3, told they will call for test, I received no calls and today on my 4th visit they said it got denied despite the letter requesting i get testing as its beneficial for my mother and my family has history of lung, breast, prostate and leukemia. \n\n- told to see another doctor for a new trigger in my finger\n\n- told I don't need my testosterone checked. I requested because I've also had an issue with feeling tired, did allll the other tests 10 years ago and just gave up, read somewhere it could be low T and I've never tested it.\n\n- I did get my ecocardiogram because I have two murmurs but I got two results. After 2nd visit to this doctor, they sent me for the ecg and on my 3rd visit said it came back good. Today on my fourth visit was told I have a slow heart rate of about 56. So makes me wonder what they were looking at the last visit. \n\nSo my question is, can doctors deny a request for tests? Or is it the genetics team that denied the test. Or option 3 which I think is the correct one, my doctor thinks anyone under 40 is healthy and won't send for any tests. \n\nShe mentioned it several times and it took 3 appointments just to get the genetics requested for them to not call me, show up on the 4th and be like oh? Did you hear they denied the test.\n\nAny info will help! Thank you",

He had a fever, cough, drooling, runny nose, and lethargy- UCC deemed allergies and set him up with a visit for his PCP a few days later to see how he was doing.

He also got bit at daycare on the chin, I called his physician who said that since he is UTD on his tetanus and currently on an antibiotic (it wasn\u2019t bad enough to require stitches) that he didn\u2019t need to be brought in and that they would check him out at his recheck this upcoming Friday.\n\nStarting yesterday he began getting small abrasions on his lips.

He\u2019s positive for HFM and still has a lot of fluid in his ear. Nothing was said about his respiratory except to keep up the robitussin and Claritin. His grandma took him to the doctor and stated there\u2019s nothing they can give for HFM and it just needs to run it\u2019s course. The doctor stated to push fluids as he already has blisters in his mouth and may not want to eat due to them. \n\nIs there anything I can do to provide comfort for him?",

Please let me know if I don\u2019t cover any relevant info. \n\n\nMe: 30\u2019s F, 5\u201910\u201d, 285 lbs. Retail worker. I was walking 5+ miles a day at work with no issues prior to this incident. \n\n\nIncident: While at work I was using a hydraulic lift cart to load merchandise into a customers vehicle. The merchandise was about 200lbs. The cart has a flat bed and a handle at the back for steering and the bed raises/lowers with a foot pump. \n\n\nThe customer stopped halfway backed in and was trying to speak to me. I locked the cart and stepped off the curb to hear him. While speaking to him I heard a noise, almost simultaneously he said \u201coh shit lookout\u201d and I felt something slam into my shin and land on my foot. \n\n\nThe cart had rolled off the 6-8inch curb, tilted forward and launched the 200lbs box into/onto my foot. The cart was elevated so this box fell about 3 feet. \n\n\nThe customer had to help me get the box off my foot and when I attempted to walk my leg buckled and I sort of kneel fell. \n\n\n\nThe injury:\nI was wearing composite toe work boots so the arch of my foot ended up taking the brunt of the impact. Immediately my ankle swelled but the bruising was fairly minor. It hurt to walk, specifically it hurt to go from toe to heel in a normal walking motion. \n\n\nI went to an urgent care the day after (there were difficulties getting paperwork from them). They did x rays and identified a minor fracture of the medial malleolus and put me in a walking boot.  I attempted to return to work in the boot but the pain was awful and not helped by OTC pain relief. \n\n\nThis occurred about four months ago and I am still dealing with pain and a very loud clicking/popping noise with each step. I have been doing PT. An MRI and was done and found nothing significant except that I have a spare foot bone/os trigonium. \n\n\nObviously this ended up going through workers comp. I am seeing a podiatrist who does not want to address the clicking nose and is of the opinion that I am recovering well. \n\n\nI am frustrated because the popping noise is constant and painful. I feel like something is out of place in my foot and that this will worsen with time. \n\n\nTLDR; foot got crushed. Minor fracture to the medial malleolus. Os trigonium/spare bone present. Four months on foot making loud, constant popping noise when walking, painful. I am a layperson but the pain/noise is around the superior/inferior extensor retinaculum and radiates up the left/outside of my shin (left foot). There is also nerve damage and numbness that comes and goes. \n\n\nWhat could be causing this?  Is there a test or type of imaging to further investigate? They want me to settle but I am concerned this will need surgery down the road.  I am pending a second opinion appt. \n\n\nThanks for reading! I will gladly answer any questions.",

I have been working with doctors for over a year now on trying to understand the nature of my symptoms. In late July of last year, I began experiencing pain and pressure that is focused on the surface of my scalp, my nose, and my temple area. The pain is usually unceasing, reactive to certain movements and postures, and can be worsened by certain things (wearing headphones, for instance, can cause pain to trigger in the area where the headphones are located). Moving my eyes can also be a trigger (in particular, my eyes seem to 'spasm' and then I feel a dull ache behind them for a bit). \n\nI am currently receiving treatment from a headache center for 'migraine', but the constant pain, as well as the attacks, do not align with migraine as I understand it. I have these headaches nearly every day, all day, from the moment I wake until the moment I go to bed. I have tried multiple medications for relief without any so far - topiramate (400mg), zonisamide (100mg), ajovy injections, and now botox injections. \n\nIt feels more like my nerves are on fire, constantly active and extremely sensitive, rather than any headache I have had prior to this starting. The headaches began after receiving a number of dental fillings, and prior to my wisdom teeth coming in last year. After exploring a lot of options, and based on where the pain is located, I am beginning to feel like I have a neuralgic condition - possibly trigeminal neuralgia, focused on the opthalmic nerve. \n\nI wanted to see if I was at least on the right track on where to start the conversation with my doctor, or if there are any other things for me to consider. The pain is unrelenting and has basically caused me to lose any semblance of a social life, and my work performance has suffered drastically. Any help is appreciated. \n\n**Additional demographic data below:** \n\nI have had the following diagnostics: \n\n* Full bloodwork (iron and vitamin b12 was low, have been treated for 3 months) \n* Brain MRI (clean) \n\nI have the following medical conditions: \n\n* Hypothyroidism\n* High blood pressure\n* Obesity (Class III) \n* Bipolar disorder (type 2) \n\nI am taking the following medications daily: \n\n* Levothyroxine 150mcg \n* Estradiol 4mg\n* Lamictal 150mg \n* Zonisamide 100mg\n* Lisinopril/Hydrochlorathiazide 20/12.5\n\nIn addition, I take the following supplements: \n\n* Vitamin D\n* Vitamin B12\n* Iron\n\n&#x200B;",

I\u2019m a very heavy sleeper and, once I\u2019m out, his snoring won\u2019t wake me up. However, it\u2019s quite hard actually falling asleep some nights because the moments he stops breathing and is unable to inhale (his chest rises and he is clearly trying to breathe, but it becomes obstructed) makes me very nervous as I feel responsible for making sure he resumes normal breathing. Usually, I\u2019m able to jostle him slightly and he\u2019s able to resume. I know it will likely resolve without intervention since it, presumably, occurs repeatedly while I\u2019m asleep and, for quite some time this has resolved a lot of my anxiety. \n\nUnfortunately, a close friend of my sister\u2019s died very suddenly of a sleep apnea-induced brain aneurysm at the age of 35 earlier this year. While this newfound fear hasn\u2019t greatly affected my sleep, it does make me very scared. He is in his early thirties and, as is common for men of that age, he is acutely aware of and frightened by aging\u2014 I think the thought of wearing a CPAP reinforces that awareness and fear. \n\nHowever, he has very extensive and stable insurance through the company he\u2019s worked for for the past 15 years and has been made aware that corrective surgery for his septum might be covered by insurance as well as potentially fix this issue. FWIW, his sleep apnea has been destructive to his life in ways more tangible than the idea that he could die in his sleep. It has clearly impacted the quality of his sleep for many years, to the point that, if he is stationary (seated or laying down) without active stimulation, he will be completely and deeply asleep within 30 seconds. It\u2019s actually remarkable to see, as someone who has a reasonably hard time falling asleep. \n\nHe has agreed to pursue medical help for the issue. My question is what the first step looks like and how we should proceed. Should he schedule a consultation with an ENT? Or a GP (we moved under a year ago and I don\u2019t believe he has one here)?\n\n(For the sake of clarity, he is very financially stable and capable of paying for what might not be covered by insurance. If he has no choice but to use a CPAP, he\u2019s going to have to get over it. Rather he feel \u201cold\u201d than be dead before 50). \n\nThank you all in advance. This has been weighing on me. I don\u2019t want to lose my partner so incredibly early in life.",

I am reaching out to the community for some information and guidance regarding the physical symptoms I have been experiencing, which have been progressively impacting my life for the worse. I've tried to keep these symptoms hidden for some time, but recently they have become unbearable, leading to extreme health issues.\n\nI have been dealing with anxiety for nearly a decade. In the early years, I considered it a normal sensation that would pass after a few seconds. However, as time went on, the duration and intensity of my anxiety increased significantly. It became associated with certain physical attributes, such as heights or open spaces, leading me to avoid such situations. Over the years, my brain has linked anxiety to many variables, causing me to restrict various activities to avoid triggering anxiety symptoms.\n\nCurrently, my anxiety has reached a state where I constantly feel pressure on my chest, as if something heavy is building up. This sensation is persistent, lasting 24 hours a day. When I encounter a situation tied to my anxiety triggers, my heart rate increases, and I experience vertigo, numbness in my legs, and bowel issues. Occasionally, I even feel skipped heartbeats.\n\nMy goal is to regain a sense of normalcy, just like I felt 10 years ago. I miss the days when I didn't feel constant chest pressure or my heart racing due to unknown thoughts. I want to travel, enjoy life, and participate in activities like any other person, free from panic episodes. I have tried taking supplements like vitamin D3, folic acid, B12, and iron, but unfortunately, they haven't provided any relief. As a coping mechanism, I find that online games help calm my symptoms, but I spend a significant amount of time engaged in this activity.\n\nI am now seeking advice on how to reach out to a nearby doctor or healthcare professional who can help me with my symptoms. I'm unsure if there is a possible treatment for my condition, but I refuse to believe that I have to continue living like this without any hope for improvement.\n\nIf anyone has had a similar experience or has insights into possible remedies or treatment options, I would greatly appreciate your advice. Additionally, if you could provide guidance on how to effectively communicate my symptoms to a healthcare professional, it would be incredibly helpful.\n\nThank you all for your time and support. I look forward to hearing from you and hopefully finding a path towards relief and recovery.",

The bandage is latex, for some context. I put it on yesterday, and woke up today to take it off and see if the damage has changed. Upon taking it off, however, my wrist was burning like the surface of the sun. It feels just like a sunburn, and was extremely red and enflamed. The red patches are raised, leaving a lot of bumps around my wrist.\r  \n\r  \nI washed my arm off and grabbed an ice pack and rubbed it around my wrist, and that made me feel better immediately. Though, I am still suspicious. I have used these bandages and petroleum jelly before, most notably on my leg when I got a large gash, and I had no adverse effects. I am not allergic to latex, and the bandages were not too tight. And yet, my arm still has raised, red bumps that burn and hurt, right in the bandage's place.\r  \n\r  \nFor more knowledge, the bandages I used were the cohesive non-sterile bandages distributed by McKesson Medical-Surgical Inc., MFR# 16-3404. Thanks for any advice, the pain isn't seething anymore, but still is very much there and gets agitated when I touch the red bumps.\n\nI thought it was an allergic reaction, since that's the obvious answer, but I'm not allergic to latex nor the petroleum jelly. I am taking 20mg of escitalopram, 150mg of lamotrigine, and a birth control with 0.250 mg norgestimate and 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol, though I have used these bandages before while on the same medications. However, I did change my prescription from 225 mg lamotrigine and 10mg escitalopram, the last time I used the bandages. I also do not have any other serious medical conditions, and have a clean slate with substances.\n\nSo, what do y'all think it is? any info would be appreciated.

No existing medical issues. Nonsmoker, nondrinker, no drug usage. I'm not sure if it could be related, but I have began to consistently do weightlifting for the past two months.\n\nI recently noticed a slight bump on my right forearm bone, roughly 4 inches away from the elbow. The bone travels straight from the right side of the wrist (same side as the pinky finger), has a slight bump where the bone goes slightly up and then back down, where it also slightly curves before continuing on a straight path towards the elbow. I'm not 100% sure, but I believe that this is the ulna bone. Initially, I though this could be a normal feature of my bone, perhaps this bone always curved and had a slight bump and I never noticed it before until today. However, I checked my other elbow and the ulna bone there appeared straight throughout the entire forearm from the wrist towards the elbow with no slight bump, which is why I became suspicious and made this post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImages: [Side view.](https://i.postimg.cc/Zq169DBG/img-1.png)  [Front view.](https://postimg.cc/8Jk7SvKS) [Picture showing entire back of forearm.](https://i.postimg.cc/SR84SjF0/img-4.png) \n\nNote: I circled the rough location of the bump in the first two images so its more clearly visible and not to be confused with the other pimples in the area of the arm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe slight bump is immovable which is why I suspect the bump is some curvature of the forearm bone and not some skin rash. The region of curvature/bump is relatively small, roughly 0.5 inches, though for some reason the bump is slightly visible and appears larger than it actually is when viewing the arm. Other than the bump, I don't feel any abnormal growth of any bone in that area. The bump is painless, I just happened to find it randomly as I was inspecting my arm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs a slight bump of the forearm ulna bone as it travels towards the elbow a normal anatomy of the human body or is this potentially serious? I'm suspecting this is just some normal feature of my bone that I never noticed in my life until today, but I wanted to err on the side of caution. Perhaps it could have been some former bruise or other injury to the bone to the area that I just never noticed and healed, but I would think that a injury to the bone would hurt enough that I would remember the incident. Should I see my primary care physician just to be safe here? I was a little nervous of going to the doctor in case this is not a serious thing or if this is an overreaction and I end up just wasting their time.",

I\u2019ve had a confirmed herniated disc in my lower back (I think L5) for over a year now with symptoms going back over 2 years. Last year I went in for an MRI to figure out what was going on when I collapsed from a sharp pain down my left leg. Found out what was going on and did some intense sessions of spinal decompression. I say intense because I unfortunately don\u2019t have a very \u201cnormal\u201d life. I travel for a living running a construction business and am gone 300+ days a year. I had ten days off when I was going through all this and the doctor wanted to expedite the procedures. So I went full in doing 1 hour sessions on the table at 135-155 lbs of force. It sucked ass and durning one particular session I couldn\u2019t control the pain and was struggling breathing and dripping sweat but the doctor kept me on the table.. I personally think something bad happened because for about 10 days after that it hurt to pretty much do anything. \n\nFast forward a year I\u2019m still in a lot of pain. About 4 months ago I had another \u201ctwinge\u201d that has made me have constant and rather sever sciatica down my left leg. I constantly have nerve pain shooting down my leg and after a days work, getting clean and resting for a moment I can barely get up and walk I\u2019m in so much pain. It ebs and flows week to week some weeks I feel pretty good and like I\u2019m on the mend then get kick back down. \n\nSo here\u2019s my dilemma. I have a business that requires me to be on the road constantly, I can\u2019t take the amount of time off I need to consistently do spinal decompression nor do I know if I want to do that again. I\u2019ve been advised by doctors that surgery isn\u2019t a good idea with my line if work in that I can just re-injure myself maybe more severely. I also won\u2019t be able to have that much downtime for the healing process. I\u2019ve tried the stretching and exercises but that has always seemed to make it worse. I know there are Corazon shots out there but I\u2019m afraid to just numb the pain. I have learned how to work with and around the pain. I\u2019m afraid if I just numb the pain I\u2019ll just further injure my back without knowing then be in a real bad way. I feel I\u2019m stuck until I\u2019m able to get out of this line of work which I can\u2019t just quit because it is a business that fully relies on me and involves a lot of others livelihoods. I\u2019m just tired of being in pain. I\u2019m 29 and feel like I\u2019m 70 when I\u2019m walking around.

I sustained what I believe to be a chostochondral separation (I.E. separated rib) approximately 54 days prior to this post. \n\nWhile I was training Brazilian jujitsu, I was trying to escape from a ground position against an opponent with great top pressure. I was lying in a position similar to a right lateral recumbent position. I attempted to roll over my right shoulder to my back, which is a normal movement for me in that scenario, and subsequently felt 2-3 pops in my rib cage on the right side with a sharp pain while attempting the maneuver. The pain was located laterally to the sternum about 2 inches below the nipple line, and radiated laterally toward the coronal plane. I\u2019m a very flexible person and my body cracks and pops all the time (plus the adrenaline took the edge off the pain), so I tried to persevere through and felt 2 more pops at the same location. I stopped the training session and tried to walk it off for a few minutes and began to feel better. I then tried to train again and immediately felt 2-3 more pops at the same location just from extending my arms and moving. The pain was now more intense at this moment. I stopped training and laid on my back for 10-20 minutes with no improvement to the pain. \n\nI then drove myself to a local ER where I got the normal blood work up, EKG, and an X-ray. My pain increased in severity so they have me Toradol to take the edge off. The ER physician told me my X-rays looked fine and discharged me. \n\nThe next day, I coincidentally had my annual physical exam with my primary care physician. He\u2019s a D.O., so when I told him about my injury, he palpated my rib cage and said he could note what felt like a rib \u2018dislocation\u2019. I\u2019m an EMT, so I of course tried palpating the difference my physician noted on my right side in comparison to my left side and could not tell a difference. My PCP told me to expect a 1-2 week recovery and that I might notice my rib pop back into place during that time. He told me returning to jujitsu will be based on my pain tolerance. \n\nWell, I\u2019m now 54 days since the injury and my pain has mostly improved. I do still have pain with pressure/forceful contact. I never experienced any sort of popping sensation to indicate my rib has relocated itself. \n\nMy question is this:\n\nFirstly, did I actually sustain a separated rib? Or is this some other injury? \n\nSecondly, if it is a separated rib, what is my risk for re-injury? \nI\u2019d like to return to training jujitsu, and if it\u2019s only a matter of pain tolerance, at this point I can persevere through the discomfort. My concern is that I would return too soon and re-injure or worsen an injury that I\u2019ve waited 2 months to recover from already. \n\nAny thoughts or insight anyone has would be greatly appreciated as there is not a lot of good information on a separated rib injury on the internet. Thanks in advance!",

Not taking any substances, no smoking, etc etc.\n\nI\u2019ve been having a cough for the last 2 weeks. Prior to developing the cough I had a sore throat for 2 days, then a VERY itchy/dry throat for another day, and the cough started from the feeling of needing to constantly clear my throat. I had pretty bad postnasal drip initially which I think was what gave me a sore throat, but it\u2019s pretty much gone now.\n\nI haven\u2019t had any other symptoms which I thought was strange, and I\u2019ve never had allergies before that gave me anything more than a stuffy nose. Occasionally I will cough and taste saltiness from mucus, but no big globs or anything. Mucus is clear.\n\nIt usually stops once I\u2019m laying down and quiet. It doesn\u2019t bother me when I\u2019m trying to sleep, and when I first wake up in the morning. It only starts when I start talking, laughing, or walking about in the house and doing light activity.\n\nWhat I REALLY find strange though is that I went outside and walked around for a couple hours, NO coughing. It was even hot out so I was panting. Still no cough, unless I was thinking about coughing (and then of course I make myself cough a little).\n\nAny ideas? I know I\u2019m supposed to get a cough checked after 3 weeks, but I\u2019ve never experienced a cough like this before so was wondering if I could get opinions.

        "context": "Strange Rash like abnormality following Veins\n25 Year old Male \nNot using any medication, though I do smoke marijuana recreationally. Drink occasionally but not a lot or often. Only known allergy is Grass. No exposure to oils, chemicals, fuels etc. Commercial fisherman, that relevance of that is explained towards end of post.\n\nTo start, this is the 3rd time this has occurred for me, and I have been to a hospital previously for this issue. While it looks VERY similar to blood poisoning, it is 100% confirmed not to be. \n\nTHE ISSUE: I have had a strange, rashlike abnormality as stated in title, that has now popped up for a 3rd time in 6 years. Everytime it occurs on both forearms bilaterally, and what makes this \"rash\" particularly interesting is it follows my veins perfectly, starting about 5 inches above the wrist and ending just before the elbow. It starts on the first day as a kind of blotchy red rash following the veins on the inside of the forearm, and the 3rd time this occured I noticed a kind of burning/itching sensation on the forearm. On day 2 it stays the same red, less blotchy but is about the perfect width of my vein. Day 3ish it starts to turn  dark, and by day 4-5 there's no sign of any redness or irritation, just a dark, almost scar tissue textured line following veins perfectly. Previously it has lasted roughly 7-10 days before subsiding. I call this an abnormality as I never had any confirmation on what it was.\n\nSTEPS ALREADY TAKEN: I have visited the hospital for this issue, and was immediately more or less the hospitals priority patient for a few days. The Triage Nurses, Doctors, Head of the ER, and other ER nursing staff had never seen something like this occur bilaterally on both arms and had no explanation for it. The first guess was possibly DVT, but ultrasound scans ruled that out (it should be noted, the doctor pointed out that the veins in the afflicted area seemed softer then those that were unaffected). Also had a dermatologist inspect it and perform a biopsy. He left me a voice mail saying he knew what the \"rash\" was, though didn't know why it only followed the veins. He didn't relay what the rash was and I'm trying to see if I can obtain a report on that as its now relevant again. It was at this point last time that the dark lines disappeared so further tests weren't able to be conducted. As far as any of the doctors were aware, this hasn't been reported on before as they had no luck finding anything that explained it. \n\nI am a fisherman, and the only reason I mention this is because the only time this happens has been on a boat and generally in higher temperatures. I'll also note that my arms are quite vascular and protrude from the skin a fair amount. Everytime this rash happens, the veins no longer create that \"bump\" if that makes sense, hence the doctor mentioning the veins seemed like they went soft (I don't do drugs/use needles to clarify). There's no other correlating factors that I've been able to take note of. I have taken photos since it first appeared this time to track its progress from the \"rash\" to it turning to a darker colour. \n\nI'm curious if any medical personnel have seen anything similar that might be able to give some idea as to what it is and maybe that can potentially help medical personnel on this end",

I was drugged for most of it, probably some kind of pain killer or sedative. I was also often left with physical trauma and regularly had tearing and bleeding. \n\nWhen I was about 10 I got my period, but I thought it was just from my abuse, so I didn't realize. Thus, no one knew. When I was 11, I had (what I now know as an adult) a miscarriage by myself. I had no idea I was pregnant so I didn't tell anyone. Some people had started to comment on my stomach growing, making jokes about me getting fat and looking pregnant. But I had no sex education or knowledge at all of biology, so I was just confused. Anyway, I'll spare the details unless they are needed, but I passed a fetus and a LOT of blood and tissue. The fetus was kind of deformed and the color was kind of purple, the head still had a kind of lima bean shaped with black dots (?) for eyes. It had legs arms and the beginning of nubs for toes and fingers. It was about the size of my palm, maybe a little smaller. I am wondering if by that description anyone would be able to give an estimate for how far along I was? I bled pretty heavily for three days and just faked a stomach bug. \n\nMy next question has to do with my health now. I have VERY painful menstruation. It feels like blood just collects in my organs and feels like they are going to burst. The lighter my period is, the more it hurts. The only thing that's ever helped some us being on the birth control pill. I've had pelvic ultrasounds, and I do have ovarian cysts but no evidence of abnormal endometrial tissue. My hormone levels also suggested PCOS, so that is what they diagnosed me with. My obgyn also has commented that I have one of the smallest cervix openings she has ever seen. She was like visibly shocked the first time she examined me. \n\nAlso, the first time I had PIV sex as an adult (24 years old), my hymen was already broken and damaged from childhood, so there was no tearing there, but my vagina inside was like ..blocked? It took a while and a lot of force to actual get my inner vaginal cannal to open. It was not vaginismus, as I've experienced that. My muscles where very relaxed and it wasn't a lubrication problem. It was like an internal blockage. Once I finally got past it, there was almost like a popping sensation and a LOT of blood. But after that, no problems with PIV sex. \n\nOne other thing I should mention is I have memories of being hospitalized for a few days with some kind of vaginal injury as a kid, maybe 6 years old, I definitely had some kind of surgical procedure under anesthesia. I remember my parents telling the doctors it was due to a bike accident. Unfortunately, all of my medical records were wiped at the hospital so they can give me no information (long story).\n\nThanks for reading all of that. Does anyone have any feedback for me?

        "context": "38 Male - Swelling of right index finger around proximal phalange. Xray taken, Ultrasound done, no satisfying conclusion. Looking for an otrthopedic opinion. Details inside.\nSummary of medications and procedures:\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \nAumentin - 7 day course + 3 additional days\n\nDoxycycline - 7 day course\n\nClindomycin - 7 day course\n\nRocephin - IV antibiotics\n\nX-Ray\n\nUltrasound  \n\\----------------------------------------------------------------  \n\n\nOn June 27th, 2023 I wash bitten by my pet cat on my right index finger where the finger meets the palm. In total, there were 4 significant puncture wounds, two on the palmer side, and two on the back. Patient (I) immediately washed the affected area with soap and water and dressed the wounds with banadages. Within an hour, the finger became inflamed. Not knowing about the severity of cat bites, I went to bed that night expecting the swelling to subside. When it was still swollen in the morning, I decided to go to Urgent Cate (not the ER) after I got off work that evening. That evening, at Urgent Care, the NP examined the finger and reached the same conclusion I had made myself - bacterial infection due to cat bite resulting in cellulitis of the finger, and I was prescribed a 7 day course of Augmentin. I reprimanded myself for not acting sooner, and considered it a hard lesson learned about cat bites. I went home and began my antibiotic regimen, thinking my finger problem would be gone within the week.\n\nSeven days later, to the credit of the antibiotics, the swelling had decreased a bit, but the finger was clearly still swollen and there was still some throbbing pain, so I returned to Urgent Care. I expressed my concerns at this point that there might be something more significant going on with my finger. The NP (a different one this time) examined my finger again, told me that sometimes antibiotics take longer, and prescribed me 3 more days of Augmentin. I left this time unsatisfied.\n\nTwo days later (July 6th, 2023) I made up my mind to go to the emergency room. On the way, my partner suggested (and managed to convince me) to instead go to a nearby Prompt Care instead. Even though I was certain I would receive the same response, I obliged (the reasoning was to save money, even though my insurance would have covered the ER visit). Prompt Care NP looked at my finger, once again. At this point, I had done more research on my own, and my own armchair diagnostic was that I had managed to get a case of flexor tenosynovitis, though I wasn't 100% certain, because I did not meet all four of the Kanavel criteria for a accurate diagnosis. For one, the entirety of my finger wasn't swollen, just around the proximal phalange, and I mistaken assumed that I was able to fully extend the finger without any real pain (I was incorrect on this point.)   \n\n\nI shared my self-diagnosis with the NP, who took me to get X-Rays done of my finger. The findings of X-Rays are as follows:  \n\\-----------------------------------\n\nFindings: The bony structures are intact and normally aligned. The joint spaces are preserved. Soft tissue swelling is seen in the proximal aspect of the index finger.  \n\n\nConclusion: No acute osseous abnormality. Soft tissue swelling in the proximal index finger. No definite foreign bodies are present.  \n\\----------------------------------  \n\n\nIn addition to the X-Ray, this NP prescribed me a 7 day course of Doxycycline, and set me up with a referral to a recommended \"hand specialist\". I left with a little relief, as at least now I would be able to get a hand specialist to confim my suspicions of flexor tenosynovitis or at the very least give me a conclusive reason as to why my finger was still swollen. I called to set up an appointment with the hand specialist and it went to voice mail. I left my name and number and for 2 whole days I did not receive a call back. I was now frustrated at this point, as I had not yet had a definitive answer as to why my finger was swollen, the antibiotics were no longer showing any signs of affect, and I couldn't get ahold of the hand specialist.  On July 14th, 2023, I had reached my breaking point, and drove myself to the nearest ER.  \n\n\nAfter a 7 hour wait (understandable), I was finally face to face with an actual doctor. Took one look at my finger, and after I explained the series of events and my own self diagnosis, he began testing for the 4 Kanavel signs. Turns out, when I was testing for the pain on extension sign, I clearly wasn't pushing hard enough, because when he did it, it was painful. He also scheduled an X-ray, and their X-ray confirmed what the Prompt Care X-ray showed, as mentioned above. At this point, he called for an orthopedic surgeon to come look at my finger. While flexor tenosynovitis was the suspected culprit, the orthopedic surgeon noted that if it was that, that it was strange for the swelling to be localized to just around the proximal phalange, and not the whole finger (sausage finger). He scheduled an ultrasound to be done on my finger later in the week. I was also at this point prescribed a 7 day course of Clindomycin, and was also given IV antibiotics (cefTRIAXone ((Rocephin)). Here is the relevant clinical summary of the attending physician:\n\n\\------------------------------  \nMusculoskeletal: There is focal swelling of the right index finger between MCP and PIP. there is point tenderness. He can range the finger in both flexion and extension. Hyperextension does recreate pain in the finger between the MCP and the PIP. There is no palmar induration or tenderness to examine.\n\nGiven the persistence of swelling on the patient I did consult with orthopedic surgery despite not being an overt tenosynovitis. The consulting doctor was kind enough for ED consultation this morning and feels with the focality of the patient's pain the best management strategy is broadening antibiotics with close follow up which he will provide in his clinic.\n\nPatient previously on Augmentin though it was 500/125 TID for 7 days. Patient is now on doxycycline 100 mg PO BID. Usually this would be combined with clindamycin and that was started in ED as well as a large dose of 3rd generation cephalosporin. The consulting doctor will see the patient in his clinic in 1 week.\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\nOn Wednesday of this week, I went to see the consulting orthopedic doctor, who examined the finger and looked at my finger on the ultrasound. At this point I had more knowledge of flexor tenosynovitis in my head than I ever wanted, and expected to see the cause of my swelling and continued pain show up on the ultrasound in the form of an abscess or pus. I had mentally prepared myself for the ortho doc to confirm my suspicions and tell me that I would have to have surgery to drain the pus out of my finger.\n\nThis did not happen. Ultrasound did not discover any signs of an abscess or any signs of pus. Ortho doc says he has no reason to operate on my finger, because there is nothing to drain. Doc sent me home and told me to continue taking the antibiotics I was prescribed. When I asked then, \"why is my finger still swollen?\" I was not given a conclusive answer - only that injuries on the extremities, especially the hands, can sometimes take a while to heal. I was recommended alternating hot and cold soaks of my finger to see if that would help with the swelling, which is something I've been doing since this whole ordeal started, anyway.\n\nCurrently, the finger is still swollen around the proximal phalange, and from my untrained eye, it seems to be about as inflamed as it was 2 weeks ago. I cannot clench my fist. The index finger is still held in partial flexion. For a mental image, if I attempt to make a hook shape with my index finger, I am unable to do so. I feel pain at the base of the proximal phalange and even a bit around the metacarpal bone of the index finger when i apply significant pressure.\n\nIn summary, I am no closer today of knowing exactly why my finger is still swollen, and the general consensus of all the nurse practitioners and doctors I have talk to is to wait and see. Which, to be clear, is fine *if that is indeed the best course of action.* And that's all the information I have. Hopefully it was informative. I tried to include as much detail as possible. I will close this post with a collection of images of the finger. These were taken last week, but as far as I can tell, the finger looks the same today as it did then. \n\nUltimately, what I'm looking for in a reply here is if the \"Wait and see\" option is the correct course here. I'm wondering if somebody missed something. It has been swollen for nearly a month now, and I have bombarded this finger with a multitudinous payload of antibiotics, and they don't seem to be doing anything.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my post.\n\n[Image 1 - Front of finger](https://imgur.com/a/ixRNg4C)\n\n[Image 2 - Back of Finger](https://imgur.com/a/KNx0row)\n\n[Image 3 -  Side of finger / how far it can currently bend](https://imgur.com/a/f76Z0Hu)\n\n[Image 4 - Side of finger (attempt at holding all fingers in hyper extension)](https://imgur.com/a/SdOuDJu)\n\n[Image 5 - Left Hand side view for comparison of left index finger and right index finger.](https://imgur.com/a/QX4AHOr)  \n",

Both medicines were a miracle to me and a poison at the same time. Literally, Lexapro fixed all my mental problems that I suffered all my life since I was a child. \nBoth SSRI made me sleepy and less motivated, especially in the morning. In the night I felt so awake that I couldn\u2019t sleep, I have been 24-26 hours awake and can\u2019t sleep no matter what I did. Also both SSRI made me very unstable.\nIn summary the meds were a miracle, but couldn\u2019t sleep and feel so unstable.\nMy doc put me on lithium plus SSRI, after reading a few reviews about lithium figured out that it\u2019s for treating bipolar disorders, and that SSRI tend to increase bipolar symptoms. Well, lithium really stabilized me and felt so good, but the insomnia were worse, I couldn\u2019t understand because it\u2019s supposed that lithium should improve my sleep, but made me some like hypomanic all day, no mood swings, all day stable, but hypomanic.\nMy doc then put me on Lamictal plus SSRI and it\u2019s the same, the day after I took my first 25 mg of Lamictal, couldn\u2019t sleep. When I was only on SSRI, If I took Ambien or Klonopin, I slept well, but that meds made me really depressed until 18-19 hours for the next day. Now with mood stabilizers and SSRI I have to take like 2-3 Ambien and only can sleep for 4-5 hours. Klonopin 1 mg always knocked me out, but now I felt NOTHING from Klonopin and can\u2019t sleep (it\u2019s not something like tolerance, because when I withdraw my mood stabilizers, Ambien and Klonopin made me sleep well instantly)\nNow I\u2019m on Wellbutrin 300 and Lamictal 200 (I have been on both 4 months), and I can sleep again with no problems, but I feel exactly like I was before taking ssri, I feel like I have a little more energy, but the depression and anxiety it\u2019s the same that before, it\u2019s like I am on nothing, just a little more enrgized. \n\nI want to know if anyone has been through this, like, adding a mood stabilizer to an SSRI and the insomnia worsened. I feel like I lost all the hope on being well mentally. I have been on meds from like 3 years and yet I cannot say that I have been good and stable for more than two days straight in years. SSRI seems the only med that works for me, but at the same time they are poison to me \ud83d\ude1e.\n\nI was reading that Prozac it\u2019s the most friendly SSRI for bipolar people, I\u2019d like to know if anyone has been for something like that, so I can say to my doc if we can try that ( also feel like a liability to my doc, three years going there and almost no progress)\n\nI am Male 24 years old if that matter. Also tried ADHD meds: Vyvanse and Strattera gave me\nInsomnia, but it\u2019s not like the SSRI, this insomnia was more like I was anxious and that made me sleep poorly, a little dosage of some anxiolytic med and sleep well through the night. The SSRI insomnia it\u2019s not like that, because I don\u2019t feel anxious, it\u2019s like my body don\u2019t want to sleep no matter what.\n\nSorry for my English, I am Spanish native speaker.",

We believe the foot drop came on immediately after the accident, but due to the extent of other injuries, we didn\u2019t formally look into foot drop for a couple of weeks. I was unable to lift my foot immediately after the accident, as I did attempt to walk to the ambulance on the night of. \n\n The combination of lower back/buttocks pain and the inability to lift the front of my foot resulted in a diagnosis of foot drop. My foot does not respond to any reflex tests, and even the electric pulses during the nerve conduction study, did not cause my foot to lift. \n\nUnfortunately, this is about where the information stops. Since this point, I\u2019ve done thoracic and lumbar spinal MRIs, which revealed bulging discs in my lumbar spine at the L5/S1 levels, but these aren\u2019t impacting the nerve and don\u2019t explain the drop foot. I\u2019ve had a lower leg nerve conduction study, which showed no breaks in the nerves from my knee down. \nSince then, despite being diagnosed with foot drop by a spinal surgeon, 2 physios, my regular doctor and the neurologist who did the nerve conduction study, nobody has been able to tell me where to go next.

When I say urge to pee I mean pee is on the highway and wants to come out.  The pee is not the normal strong steam that I usually get.  I feel like I'm getting this urge to pee when my bladder is not really full and thus why there is not a lot.\n\nI've also noticed issues where I'll pee and then 5 minutes later I have the urge to pee again and the same amount of pee comes out as before.  Sometimes the stream gets in to this pattern of start then slow down and then back to speed. I can feel the muscle, or whatever it is, involuntary contract a bit before relaxing again and letting the pee flow.\n\nIt seems to have gotten better since Wednesday as the urge was basically all the time and now it's just after I have drank too much liquids and after dinner.  The urge is also not on the highway kind but more of a normal I have to pee.  I'll pee a bunch times as described above over the course of a couple hours and then it feels like I'm back to normal.  Wednesday and Thursday night I was having issues sleeping with the constant urge to pee.\n\nI've noticed in the last 24 hours that standing seems to make things go back to closer to normal and sitting posture seems to matter as well.  If I sit up straight it seems to make the urges go away over  bad posture like slouching in my seat.  I don't seem to have the issue lying done at this point either.\n\nI don't think it's a UTI as there is no burning, discharge, or anything along those lines.  It's just frequent urination where not a normal amount comes out.  I've been drinking cranberry juice anyways as a precaution.  I think the sex act with my spouse may have done something strange to my bladder and the nerves to potentially cause this.\n\nSo the sex act is probably not what you think.  I'm a male (42) and my spouse is a female.  She likes to be a dominate at times and Tuesday night was one of those nights.\n\nSo basically we had a milking table situation where she was edging me and not letting me release until she says so.  This went one for over an hour.  At one point while I was erect I said I have to pee.  She being the dominate person said I was not allowed to stop and pee.\n\nHonestly I thought it felt pretty good with her stroking me on the edge while I had that peeing sensation going on.  So I didn't use the safe word and let her continue.  So after 15 more minutes of this I finally exploded all over the place and went to pee.\n\nThis was one of those pees with an erection so it didn't go well with all the bending to make sure pee get in the toilet and not all over the place.  Anyway I pee and go back to my wife, but 5 minutes later I get the urge to pee again where it felt like pee was on the highway.  This happened a bunch more times throughout the night.\n\nAnyways after this event with my wife the peeing has been a little messed up.  I think some nerves and signals in my body may have got crossed up with the above event.  I have not done anything sexual since, either solo or with my wife.\n\nMy wife actually feels terrible and thinks she broke something in my penis / bladder.  I tell her it's not her fault and say it'll be all ok, but she still feels bad.  I try to comfort her the best I can.\n\nAnyways, I'm not looking for direct medical advice as I said I'm calling my doctor on Monday for an appointment that will probably not be on Monday.  The practice is pretty busy with same day appointments not being available outside of an emergency, which this is not in my mind.\n\nThough I was thinking if I should go to Urgent Care or something to get something checked out.  I don't think my prostate all of a sudden grew and became a problem overnight, but if I need the finger up the butt to check things out sooner than later then fair game for urgent care.\n\nThough if anybody has some related situations they were in that can calm my mind then that would be great.  Even if it was you had something similar happen and just took it easy for a week and things got back to normal. I'm still going to see my doctor, but it would help ease the mind.\n\nI've been exercising and doing Yoga for the last year to get in better health as I've lost 40lbs and 8 inches off my waist.  So if there are some poses that help with bladder functionality then I'm game to incorporate them in to my routine.\n\nThanks for reading and sorry it is so long.  I've been thinking about this for a bit, lol.",

I drink like once a month with friends. I [23F, 5\u20198\u201d, 145lbs] have had CHRONIC constipation from the time I was 2 years old. My bowel movements have always been infrequent, (once every 4-5 days), and they are incredibly large and painful to pass. No doctor has taken this seriously, and they tell me I need to change my diet to include more fruits and vegetables. \n\nI have tried everything under the sun in terms of diet to try to help, but nothing helps. Two foods make it worse: Bagels and bananas. If I eat either of those, I can expect not to poop for a week. I have been on miralax my entire life. It\u2019s frustrating to be on it, because my body will swing to overly soft poops, I\u2019ll stop taking it for a day or two, and then all of the sudden I have like a rock in my stomach of poop. Miralax also takes 3-4 days to kick in each time. \n\nThe only thing I consume that causes me to have a bowel movement within 10 hours is alcohol. If I drink, the next morning it feels like I finally passed everything that had been sitting in my body for the last week. This is not to say I use it for this. I am not a frequent drinker. I am just wondering why NOTHING I eat or consume helps, but for some reason alcohol clears me out IMMEDIATELY. \n\nI have suspected ehlers-danlos, and sometimes it just feels like the main problem is that my intestines just don\u2019t move things along. I do have a family history of colon cancer, and I intend on making a gastro appointment soon, but I am not worried about cancer currently because I have been constipated my whole life. Regardless, the gastro appointment is 20 years overdue, because I can\u2019t live like this anymore. I have so much constipation that it causes acid reflux and extreme bloating. I also have INTENSE stomach pain that burns in the lower part of my stomach that I attribute to the constipation and gas. It hurts so bad that my face will turn pale, I burn up, and I get sweaty. \n\nSo my question is: Why does alcohol work? Are there any suggestions on other medicines I could take that would move things along? And any ideas about why someone would have chronic constipation their whole life? Obviously I will be going to a doctor, but just wondering if anyone had any thoughts about if there\u2019s something wrong with me or if some people are just born with chronic constipation. \n\n\nMedications:\n\nViibryd 40mg\nWellbutrin 300mg\nAlprazolam .5mg\n\nDiagnoses:\nAnxiety \nDepression\nOCD\nADHD\nInflammatory arthritis\nSuspected EDS (according to drs)",

Its almost impossible doing simple tasks and my relatives have been taking care of me and making my meals. I have apathy and physical numbness, can't feel my body temperature properly, tremors. I can walk, though it feels weird, and my strength is fairly normal. It feels like suddenly I lost some layers of tissue in my body. I have control over my muscles but it doesn't feel the same, like fine motor control is slightly different. My breathing rhythm is abnormal and muscles in my diaphragm or stomach area are weak.

My training partner went to \u201csweep\u201d my foot (kicking my foot up off the mat with his foot to take me down to the mat). I lifted my foot to avoid his, planted it back on the mat, and immediately slipped in sweat and my leg twisted behind me and I landed on it hearing/feeling a \u201ccrunch\u201d but no pop. I laid in the mat and an ER nurse with trains there came over felt around my leg and put me in a makeshift splint with a cardboard box and athletic tape. I went to the ER. They did multiple X-rays. The doctor there said I fractured my proximal fibula via a spiral fracture but that it was minor and I had a bad ankle sprain. Their X-ray report of my ankle says there is no fracture or dislocation in it. They gave me crutches and a short term ankle and leg brace to be replaced when I went for follow up with ortho.\n\nThe next day I went to see an orthopedic surgeon. They did a quick physical exam, then did a stress x-ray by moving my ankle under the X-ray while I laid down. There was no additional pain felt in my ankle when this was done. They said I had ligament instability in my ankle and would need to have a plate and screws surgically inserted. They wanted surgery for two days later. No MRI or other test were done, I was put in a splint and I was sent on my way.\n\nMy primary care physician asked if an MRI was ordered. I said no. They believed one should be done prior to going right to surgery. I sent a message to ortho letting them know what my primary said and asked if they thought it would help based on their experience. It was read but never replied to. Primary care doctor ordered an mri and sent a referral to another orthopedic surgeon who specializes in foot and ankle injuries and is one of the best in my area, working as the foot and ankle consultant for our local professional sports teams and division one university sports teams. I have an appt with him early this upcoming week.\n\nWhen I called the first ortho to reschedule the surgery, prior to the surgery not the day of, due to my primary care physician\u2019s referral and the person driving me to the hospital not being able to the day of the surgery, the person I spoke with seemed to get upset and said I should be grateful they were able to schedule the surgery and that if it\u2019s not done within 10 days of the injury surgery will be harder and they likely won\u2019t help me. I was then told I have a Maisonneuve fracture in my ankle. I said that wasn\u2019t said to me when I was there (and I found it odd I was only directly told after calling to reschedule the surgery). They said I must have been overwhelmed and so they canceled the surgery and scheduled a follow up but said I\u2019d have to have the surgery the day after the follow up.\n\nAm I wrong for wanting a second opinion? And if I don\u2019t do surgery within ten days (it happened this past Tuesday night) will it really make surgery worse? I\u2019m not wanting to be difficult, and if I need surgery they I need it and will do it, but I want to make sure first. And I have a really good, and long standing, relationship with my primary. I trust them. So I went for the MRI she ordered and I\u2019m inclined to get the second opinion. Does anyone have any suggestions or information which might make things clearer for me?

Everything always came back clean and normal. \n\nLate 2020, I had a migraine attack that was different than my usual ones. During the attack, both of my arms became super painful. It felt like I had gotten multiple tetanus shots or covid vaccines in both arms. They were super painful. Even if I didn\u2019t move them, they were throbbing in pain. After the attack passed, my arms felt dead as if I overdid it at the gym lifting weights. It felt better the next day. This symptom did not happen again until the following year. \n\nOctober of 2021 I got hit with another strong migraine attack and the painful arm symptom came back for this one. It was beyond painful, I was crying from the pain. I was supposed to be enjoying my best friends pre-wedding celebration but was in the bedroom crying in pain. I didn\u2019t have medication with me so I suffered through it for a while. Finally after laying in the dark long enough and taking enough over the counter medication and some caffeine the severe pain became more bearable. I ran home and grabbed my imitrex and took it. I had the dead arm feeling for the rest of the night. Woke up in the morning and everything was back to normal. \n\nAll through 2022 is when my migraines started happening 6-7 times a month instead of the normal 2-3 times every 6 months. My doctor tried putting me on topomax as a preventative but it didn\u2019t work and since severe kidney stones runs in my entire family, the doctor decided to take me off of it and just use imitrex proactively. At the very first sign of a headache, he wanted me to take the imitrex to knock it out before it started. That has worked well so far but it\u2019s imitrex\u2026and obviously I don\u2019t want to overdo it. \n\nIn December 2022 the stress from work caused me to break out into Shingles. It broke out on my face on the left side and inside my ear canal. While shingles in general is painful\u2026shingles INSIDE YOUR EAR \u2026is PURE torture. My ear became so swollen it closed, it was actively bleeding, I was in excruciating pain. I spent Christmas in the hospital due to it. The doctor at the hospital was 99.9% sure I had shingles but wanted to do a CT Scan with contrast to make sure there wasn\u2019t any infection behind the ear that we couldn\u2019t see. So I got the ct scan, and the doctor came back and told me they \u201caccidentally found a brain tumor that they suspect is a meningioma during the scan.\u201d I was kind just over the fact that I was in so much pain and hearing that I had a brain tumor of some sort was just the cherry on top. \n\nI saw my neurologist and explained that my migraines went from 1-2 times every 6 months to 6-7 times per month and I had this growth found in/on my brain. He looked at the ct scan and said \u201cwe\u2019ll just keep an eye on it and get your migraines under control for now\u201d \n\n2 nights ago I had an absolutely horrible migraine. My arms were killing me, my legs were hurting this time as well, all the muscles in my body became tense and sore, I couldn\u2019t sleep, I became nauseated and had to go to the bathroom. I went to the bathroom and my dog follows me everywhere. She was sitting at the door of the bathroom and so I tried to call her to me and I couldn\u2019t speak correctly. My speech became mumbled. I knew what I was trying to say, I was completely alert and conscious but I could NOT get words out. They just sounded like mumbles and sounds. This lasted for about 5 minutes. My throat became sore as well and it felt like my tongue was swollen. \n\nEventually my migraine passed, my entire body was exhausted and painful as if I went too hard at the gym. \n\nI am currently waiting to be scheduled at Mayo Clinic where my original neurologist is. It\u2019s just tough to get in with her because she is now the director.\n\nMy question is\u2026.is it possible that the meningioma/brain tumor (not 100% diagnosed as meningioma since no further testing has been done since the hospital visit) could be causing these new symptoms with my migraines and causing the frequency of my migraines to go up? \n\nI am obviously going to be seeing my neurologist but until then, I just want to kind of get an idea of whether the growth/tumor could be a potential culprit for the worsening symptoms and more frequent migraines? \n\n**TL;DR:** Suffer from migraines since childhood. In 2020 I had 1 migraine with a new symptom where my arms became very painful. That specific symptom didn\u2019t happen again until October 2021. Had the same painful arms during the migraine attack. The entire next year my migraines went from 1-2 times every 6 months to 6-7 times a month. The arm pain happens with every attack now. December 2022 I got shingles on my face in inside my ear canal. ER physician had me do a ct scan to rule out infection and they found a brain tumor and said it looks like a meningioma. Neurologist said we will \u201ckeep an eye on it\u201d in January but I haven\u2019t had any further scans done. 2 days ago I had another severe migraine attack only this time my entire body became extremely painful, my throat became sore, and I lost the ability to speak for about 5 minutes. I was alert and coherent but could not get words out. Can the meningioma/brain growth be a potential culprit for the worsening symptoms and more frequent attacks? I am currently waiting to be scheduled for an appointment with my old neurologist at the Mayo Clinic.",

From several past bad experiences I didn't have confidence in her ability as a doctor, but baby is coming, so not really up to me. She complained to the nurse that she had to come in after dinner for me so I already had the impression her headspace was not where it needed to be. \n\nShe didn't look at my chart, or not closely to see that I had an anterior placenta. I hemorrhaged and they couldn't get her out for what felt like forever. I see a ton of people rushing in and when she's out she's not breathing and everyone is working on her. The doctor is doing all the rest of the stuff and when the sheet is moved her and the nurse's face are absolutely covered in blood. She was frazzled and very nervous. My baby comes around and by the 5 minute APGAR is at 9 instead of 1 and didn't even need to be in the NICU. I am so thankful and it was the scariest time of my life.\n\nBut my question is: could she have botched my bilateral salpingectomy? Could she have maybe forgotten to even do it? I know that doctors are used to high stress and what is scary to me may not be to them, but this person was obviously not ok. She was shaking and pale and very nervous when the curtain came down and I was stitched up. Or did she not see that I was to have a bi salp after delivery? If she looked at my chart, it wasn't very closely. I did mention it in the beginning to her, but with the scary event and the fact that she didn't seem very interested in what I had to say, I'm wondering if it was even done or done accurately. How could this happen? Can anyone offer insight into this? \n\nI did look up her reports to verify if it was done. They are not detailed at all. Doesn't mention a salpingectomy at all, glosses over the blood loss and even though it was more than 1800 she said it was \"no more than expected\" in her report. Didn't say anything about my baby not breathing or any mention of the placenta whatsoever. For being in there for 90 minutes, it was very, very short. \n\nLabs mention the fallopian tubes, but no detail besides the exact same descriptors for each, like they could have been copied and pasted identically.

They took both a clean and dirty urine sample, and they prescribed me some fluconazole, and told me I have a urinary track infection. So they started me off on 500 mg of cephalexin every 12 hours.     \n\nI felt like the cephalexin wasn\u2019t helping, but the UTI was relatively asymptomatic from the beginning. I didn\u2019t really have any urgency to urinate or burning. The fluconazole wound up being useless for the yeast and it kept multiplying and camping inside of me without any discharge at all. \n\nThen, Friday July 14th evening I get a call back from the urgent care that my culture results came back from quest. It tested positive for 50,000-100,000 CFU/mL of enterococcus Faecalis. It was susceptible to ampicillin with an MIC of <=2, vancomycin with an MIC of 1, and resistant to tetracycline. I am allergic to fluoroquinolones, but ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin had similar MIC\u2019s. \n\nSo the urgent care decided to write me a prescription for 100 mg of nitrofurantoin every 12 hours for a week.  At the same time I was complaining to the PA/provider over the phone about kidney pain, and he told me not to be worried. That Friday, the whole day, I had pain in my kidneys that became more frequent and felt like a dual radiating ache in the right kidney. Friday night the pain spread to the left kidney and was hurting a lot and I had developed a low-grade fever for the first time, so I decided to go to the emergency room and they gave me ceftriaxone through IV and discharged me the same night soon after. My blood work came back fine, except for elevated ionized calcium in my blood and slightly elevated white blood cells and leukocytes. The urine culture came back fine. There was no growth of bacteria and my CT scan showed no pyelonephritis.\n\nSo I stuck on the nitro and realized it wasn\u2019t helping, i developed new symptoms stabbing pain in bladder and pain when urinating and leaking urine all day, so July 17th night I went to the emergency room again where they gave me 3 g of ampicillin through an IV and prescribed me amoxicillin 500mg three times a day. They again did a culture and another CT scan and more bloodwork and all of it came back normal. I followed up with an infectious disease doctor on July  20th who asked me if I want to be admitted for a few days to get IV or not, but he told me he thinks I can beat it with antibiotics. The only change he made is that he put me on 500mg of amoxicillin FOUR times a day for FOURTEEN days. \n\nFor the yeast I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gone it\u2019s asymptomatic unless I tried to scrape it out and then it bleeds and causes painful urination. I took brexafemme for it and have been taking monistat 7 everyday if it will do anything. \n\nI legit have no clue what the hell to do, I\u2019ve been on 1500mg of amoxicillin everyday since July 18th and switched to 2000mg of amoxicillin everyday since July 20th. I still have aching stabbing kidney pains/back pains and flank pain to the touch that come and go. I still have a low grade fever almost nonstop which only goes down to normal temperature at night. I sit in A/C all day and my hands and feet freeze yet feels like my face is burning and my temperature typically sits around 99.5 all day. Some lymph nodes in my neck feel swollen and sore some days. \n\nI am losing my mind over this and not sure if hospitalization and IV treatment is the answer. I\u2019ve been having so much stress and anxiety about this that maybe that\u2019s contributing towards fever and not recovering. But I\u2019m trying everything I can- no smoking no drinking no dairy other than yogurt. Limit fatty foods. I am tracking my temperature every 30 min to see if it correlates to when I take antibiotics (it doesn\u2019t). I wake myself up in the middle of the night to take my next dose of antibiotics on the dot. But literally nothing is improving, I\u2019m stagnant with low grade fever and kidney pains and average fever seems to slowly get worse/higher as the days go on. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any chance the Quest urine culture somehow missed a bacteria?",

Please let me know if more information is needed and I'll answer questions:\n\nYears ago, I was seeing an allergist and getting weekly shots for yeast/mold/dust allergies. I occasionally still ate bread, and I was always coughing afterwards especially with burger buns. I stopped when I had to deal with some mental health issues.\n\nThe day after the skies turned orange from the Canada fires, my throat was sore. I didn't realize my window was slightly ajar, and I had breathed in the outside air overnight. I was coughing up phlegm, and I struggled to fall asleep. My GP prescribed cough gels, and those helped a little bit.\n\nI scheduled to see a new allergist. I did the prick test to be safe, and everything came back with zero reactions. My allergist said my lungs were clear, but my throat was super inflamed and red. He deduced that it wasn't a coincidence that my throat hurt so much after the forest fires. He told me to continue the cough gels and prescribed two types of nasal sprays. I immediately got better to my relief.\n\nHe also found it strange that my past allergist said I have a yeast/mold allergy. Out of curiosity, I ate a burger and went into a coughing fit that eventually went away. I can drink beer, so I feel like it's something else in the buns.\n\nLast week, I went to see my allergist because the coughing issue came back again. The day after I went out with friends to a food festival, I went back to my coughing fit. I went back on the coughing gels and nasal spray, and it wasn't working like before. The air quality was slightly bad that day, so I wondered if this was just how it was going to be moving forward.\n\nI was doing job interviews remotely, and I was coughing the whole time. It's annoying.\n\nMy allergist seemed stumped and said my throat was inflamed again. We talked about the foods/drinks I had at the festival, and he asked if there were any foods/drinks I don't like or tend to avoid. We scheduled for blood work with a bunch of additional allergens.\n\nThe tests came back all negative. The only one the lab couldn't do was chicken meat, but I doubt it. I eat chicken meat ALL the time, both home cooked and fast food. I was recommended to seek a second opinion with a throat/nose specialist, and that appointment is coming up in 2 weeks. I don't even know how helpful this would be. Is there anything specific I should be asking this specialist? Should I be seeing a different type of doctor?",

Tired all of the time and it\u2019s ruining my life.\n41, female, 198lbs, history of debilitating insomnia, low energy, sleeping and napping but also have insomnia. Had some blood tests done 4 months ago calcium was 167.9 diagnosed parathyroidism, nuclear imagine test didn\u2019t show any reaction, had an ultrasound done they found 3 nodules on my thyroid. Fine needle aspiration was inconclusive for cancers because the doctor couldn\u2019t find it and after digging in my neck for 20 minutes I asked him to stop. Going in for a second opinion. I honestly don\u2019t care about the nodules, I don\u2019t want to lose my thyroid gland and be tired for the rest of my life. I just want my parathyroidism corrected. The chances of me having cancer are so slim I just want them to observe it for a while. All of my tests for thyroid were perfect.\n\nCurrently taking weekly vitamin D 50000, vitamin B and iron, and Trazodone 50mg to help me sleep.\n\nSleep ranges 2 to 4 hours before waking. At home sleep study didn\u2019t show any signs of sleep apnea. I don\u2019t jolt awake, my resting heart rate is around 60-65 when waking. I usually wake up to go pee.\n\nFrom what I read having very high levels of calcium in your blood is a bad thing which can cause a whole basket of issues of left untreated. I\u2019m already having bone and joint pain. The doctors I saw jumped straight to total removal of my thyroid plus any parathyroids causing issues. Wouldn\u2019t even discuss anything else. His thinking was he didn\u2019t want to have to cut me open twice. Even if I had no intention of surgery he ignored my parathyroid issue to focus on my nodules. \n\nThe doctor that did my FNA even questioned what my endocrinologist said and when he stuck the needle in, he couldn\u2019t find the nodule and kept asking the nurse where it was? He wanted to do that 12 times, I stopped him and left. He left a huge bruise on my neck and he didn\u2019t numb me properly. It hurt for over 2 weeks.\n\nI honestly just want my high calcium issues addressed and to observe the nodules over time. I wasn\u2019t even given this option thus why I\u2019m getting a second opinion.\n\nAny advice for me? I\u2019m not getting anything to lower the calcium levels if there even is such a thing. I am so sick of being tired all of the time.\n\nThank you.",

They've done multiple tests including MRI, EKG, and EMG to rule out issues related to stroke, heart, etc. I have normal BP, a slightly lower-than-average heart rate, and I'm generally healthy. I usually work out about 5-6 days/week for 60-90 minutes a session, primarily lifting but I do try to mix-in about 30-45 minutes of cycling every other session. I did have a spinal fusion over ten years ago for kyphosis, but x-rays and the like recently have said it looks to be in good order (hardware is solid, no malformities, etc.) The only medication I'm currently on, including supplements, is Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism/slow thyroid. \n\nI originally thought I had been having a stroke at work last year as I'd lost my vision in my right eye/got intense auras where it was impossible to focus on that side. They discharged me from the ER that same day and diagnosed it as an ocular migraine. It came on after what I think was excessive caffeine use (multiple energy drinks in a short window), so I quit caffeine for a few months afterwards yet still experienced and continue to experience the residual weakness in the face/shoulder/calf on my right side. These symptoms persist on and off, usually 3 to 4 times per week. I haven't had those auras/tunnel vision symptoms since.\n\nThe weakness was noticeable by my PCP during a checkup when I mentioned it and did a reflex check, and I also notice it when lifting as it seems my right-side struggles a bit more than my left despite being the dominant side. \n\nUnfortunately, I've not gotten a particular good answer from doctors about what it could be. They've ruled out the very-serious issues above but haven't given me a determination of what it *is*, only what it *isn't*. \n\nCould this be something as simple as a pinched nerve exacerbated by exercise? Sometimes I feel my neck \"pop\" on the right side if I turn a certain way, although it hasn't happened in quite a few months, so I'm curious if that's related. Otherwise, I'm at a loss and I'd love to maybe get pointed in the right direction by someone who's experienced this or seen someone with similar symptoms.\n\nThank ya!\n\n&#x200B;",

I have had gastrointestinal symptoms for years. I have seen my GP for this and she did some tests. She couldn't find anything wrong and eventually diagnosed me with IBS. I have just learned to live with my symptoms. But now I am wondering if there could be something wrong with my pancreas.\n\nA couple of months ago I started going to an orthomolecular therapist. I went there because I have long covid and I want to try everything to get better (GP only offered physical therapy). I have greatly improved since last year (but I am not fully recovered). Recently I went there again, he did some tests and told me he suspected my pancreas might not be doing its job properly (I believe he said it did not make enough enzyms but I could be mistaking) and prescribed me some enzyms I should take. Now I have been looking up a bit about the pancreas and it does seem to fit with my symptoms. I want to know if it's worth going to my GP for this or if it is unlikely and I'm just being paranoid.\n\n**Personal information**:29F - Dutch1.70 meter62 kiloI do not smoke. I do drink, but only occasionely.\n\n**GI-symptoms:**\n\n* Fatty, sticky, floating, loose stool (sometimes very foul smelling)\n* 1 to 5 bowel movements per day. 1 is very rare and means i feel good. I'd guess 2 or 3 is common for most days? (and if its relevant: for a long time 1 per day was normal, but last couple of years it has increased to a couple of times per day)\n* Tummy aches: sometimes it's not too bad, sometimes it is. Sometimes going to a toilet helps, sometimes it really doesn't.\n* Flatulation\n* Blown up belly (it can look as if i'm several months pregnant)\n\nThese symptoms vary from day to day. Sometimes (unfortunately not often) I'll feel quite alright and sometimes i have a lot of symptoms. Most days I do at least have a couple of symptoms. Last couple of weeks it has been quite bad. The aches and diarrhea-like-stool is bothering me the most.\n\n**Other medical info:**I have long covid (since January 2022) and I might have endometriosis (which was given as a possibly diagnoses by a gynecologist, but has not been proven). I had a bad case of mono about 9 years ago after which I have not been the healthiest of persons (before mono I rarely ever got sick). Before long covid hit me I was feeling quite well, apart from the GI-symptoms. I actually ran a marathon a couple of months before. I have a big list of long covid-symptoms, but at the top of the list are: exhaustion, brain fog and easily overstimulated. I also have a couple of allergies (no food allergies i'm aware of).\n\n**Family History**On my moms side there are some gallbladder issues:\n\n* Great-grandmother first had some issues with her gallbladder and later her liver which caused her death. I don't know any details, she died in 1959 so this is a long time ago.\n* Grandmother: had her gallbladder removed due to gallstones\n* Mother and uncle: have gallstones\n\n**Medicines:**The pill and some supplements:vitamine D ( i have a deficiency)Enzymes (just started with these)PQQ meta plus (b12, q10, zinc and jiagoulan)Resveratrol\n\n**Test results** (from february 2023)Here are a couple of test results. Some are a bit low or high. Some are normal but might be relevant to my question (but NAD so not sure haha)Glucose 4,4 mmol/l (normal)Vitamine D: 41 nmol/l (low)SG urine: 1,007 (low)Leuco's urine: 34,3 \u00b5l (high)Alat: 19 U / l (normal)Asat: 19 U / l(normal)Biluribine: 4  \u00b5mol/l (normal)Not lactose intolerant, They checked for a couple of parasites but didn't find any.

With 2 months break in may but started again this week. and am curious about its potential implications on other treatments and activities. I did this therapy because I have VITLIGO and it helped reduce my vitiligo on my body A LOT it\u2019s not completely gone but I got patches of my original skin tone on my feet, hands, legs. \nPlaces that are notoriously hard to treat with vitiligo. I got mine because I was very stressed out \n\nI'm now considering a vitiligo treatment using a medication called Opzelura (ruxolitinib), and I'm wondering if my past leech therapy might have any impact on this or other treatments. The side effects for this cream are very serious and deadly. \n\nMoreover, I'm interested in knowing if there are any therapies, treatments, or activities that I should avoid because of my previous experience with leech therapy.\n\n\nAny experiences, thoughts, or information would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you in advance.",

My training partner went to \u201csweep\u201d my foot (kicking my foot up off the mat with his foot to take me down to the mat). I lifted my foot to avoid his, planted it back on the mat, and immediately slipped in sweat and my leg twisted behind me and I landed on it hearing/feeling a \u201ccrunch\u201d but no pop. I laid in the mat and an ER nurse with trains there came over felt around my leg and put me in a makeshift splint with a cardboard box and athletic tape. I went to the ER. They did multiple X-rays. The doctor there said I fractured my proximal fibula via a spiral fracture but that it was minor and I had a bad ankle sprain. Their X-ray report of my ankle says there is no fracture or dislocation in it. They gave me crutches and a short term ankle and leg brace to be replaced when I went for follow up with ortho.\n\nThe next day I went to see an orthopedic surgeon. They did a quick physical exam, then did a stress x-ray by moving my ankle under the X-ray while I laid down. There was no additional pain felt in my ankle when this was done. They said I had ligament instability in my ankle and would need to have a plate and screws surgically inserted. They wanted surgery for two days later. No MRI or other test were done, I was put in a splint and I was sent on my way.\n\nMy primary care physician asked if an MRI was ordered. I said no. They believed one should be done prior to going right to surgery. I sent a message to ortho letting them know what my primary said and asked if they thought it would help based on their experience. It was read but never replied to. Primary care doctor ordered an mri and sent a referral to another orthopedic surgeon who specializes in foot and ankle injuries and is one of the best in my area, working as the foot and ankle consultant for our local professional sports teams and division one university sports teams. I have an appt with him early this upcoming week.\n\nWhen I called the first ortho to reschedule the surgery, prior to the surgery not the day of, due to my primary care physician\u2019s referral and the person driving me to the hospital not being able to the day of the surgery, the person I spoke with seemed to get upset and said I should be grateful they were able to schedule the surgery and that if it\u2019s not done within 10 days of the injury surgery will be harder and they likely won\u2019t help me. I was then told I have a Maisonneuve fracture in my ankle. I said that wasn\u2019t said to me when I was there (and I found it odd I was only directly told after calling to reschedule the surgery). They said I must have been overwhelmed and so they canceled the surgery and scheduled a follow up but said I\u2019d have to have the surgery the day after the follow up.\n\nAm I wrong for wanting a second opinion? And if I don\u2019t do surgery within ten days (it happened this past Tuesday night) will it really make surgery worse? I\u2019m not wanting to be difficult, and if I need surgery they I need it and will do it, but I want to make sure first. And I have a really good, and long standing, relationship with my primary. I trust them. So I went for the MRI she ordered and I\u2019m inclined to get the second opinion. Does anyone have any suggestions or information which might make things clearer for me? And thank you in advance. Just really stressed about surgery.",

Realize my mistake and it is fixable but this injury may not be. I am a powerlifter hoping to compete this Sept 30 for my last junior level competition. Have had no pain for about two weeks in day to day life and doctor said I could resume training if I am careful. Have been doing McGill big three and back extensions (+ a lot of walking) for the past 4 weeks. Today after waking up my back felt just a bit stiff but didn't think nothing of it. Went to squat just 60kg and didn't feel pain but discomfort and lack of flexibility. I did feel pain however when slouching and bending over though (did on purpose without weight, just to test if I still felt pain there) -- similar to a Jefferson curl (see second link). Still feel it about 6 hours later.\r  \n\r  \nI have no radiating pain but very occasionally I feel a twinge down my right leg. In hot showers, the pain or any discomfort disappears 99.9% and I can put my back through many positions without pain. If only I could squat in the shower lol\r  \n\r  \n**I am getting an epidural injection for the pain next week but still have time to decide if I should or not.** 2 doctors have said that I can continue training (carefully) but I am scared to have any sort of pain as I can only imagine what happens when I put a lot more weight on it. I mean the injection can't really hurt if it's only one and it's been shown to be effective for lumbar disc herniations (just pain management). With it I hope to be able to train more consistently although more carefully and will not be deadlifting. Squatting has never been an issue with my lower back but this injury from another movement is causing slight problems. I honestly do not think squatting will cause a reherniation as I have gotten out of some pretty ugly squats in the past with my lower back doing a lot of the work (low-bar squatter) and have always felt fine and never close to a strain or herniation. I do not know if the disc is now much more susceptible to reherniation or not -- which would change things.\r  \n\r  \n\r\r  \n**I am asking advice on if I should get the injection and your experiences with it for mild back pain**. Also if you have **any tips** (besides resting, because rest is not the best for herniated discs) **for dealing with, training with, or training around this sort of pain**. Any advice in general about herniated discs and training is really welcomed :) Thank you.",

I have had sensitive teeth for years now and haven't seen a dentist in 5+ years due to fear and anxiety.

They filled it in and filled in a bunch of other cavities. They said I might need a root canal and I got scared and never went. Its been years later and I sometimes get terrible tooth pain in the back of my jaw from both sides. Sometimes it goes away on its own and other times I have to take something for it. I'm trying to find a dentist to see asap about this because someone told me if left untreated the infection can be so bad it can go to your brain and you can die. I also saw a greys anatomy episode where after the root canal the infection spread in other places and she got sepsis. I'm just so terrified right now.

I was drugged for most of it, probably some kind of pain killer or sedative. I was also often left with physical trauma and regularly had tearing and bleeding. \n\nWhen I was about 10 I got my period, but I thought it was just from my abuse, so I didn't realize. Thus, no one knew. When I was 11, I had (what I now know as an adult) a miscarriage by myself. I had no idea I was pregnant so I didn't tell anyone. Some people had started to comment on my stomach growing, making jokes about me getting fat and looking pregnant. But I had no sex education or knowledge at all of biology, so I was just confused. Anyway, I'll spare the details unless they are needed, but I passed a fetus and a LOT of blood and tissue. The fetus was kind of deformed and the color was kind of purple, the head still had a kind of lima bean shaped with black dots (?) for eyes. It had legs arms and the beginning of nubs for toes and fingers. It was about the size of my palm, maybe a little smaller. I am wondering if by that description anyone would be able to give an estimate for how far along I was? I bled pretty heavily for three days and just faked a stomach bug. \n\nMy next question has to do with my health now. I have VERY painful menstruation. It feels like blood just collects in my organs and feels like they are going to burst. The lighter my period is, the more it hurts. The only thing that's ever helped some us being on the birth control pill. I've had pelvic ultrasounds, and I do have ovarian cysts but no evidence of abnormal endometrial tissue. My hormone levels also suggested PCOS, so that is what they diagnosed me with. My obgyn also has commented that I have one of the smallest cervix openings she has ever seen. She was like visibly shocked the first time she examined me. \n\nAlso, the first time I had PIV sex as an adult (24 years old), my hymen was already broken and damaged from childhood, so there was no tearing there, but my vagina inside was like ..blocked? It took a while and a lot of force to actual get my inner vaginal cannal to open. It was not vaginismus, as I've experienced that. My muscles where very relaxed and it wasn't a lubrication problem. It was like an internal blockage. Once I finally got past it, there was almost like a popping sensation and a LOT of blood. But after that, no problems with PIV sex. \n\nOne other thing I should mention is I have memories of being hospitalized for a few days with some kind of vaginal injury as a kid, maybe 6 years old, I definitely had some kind of surgical procedure under anesthesia. I remember my parents telling the doctors it was due to a bike accident. Unfortunately, all of my medical records were wiped at the hospital so they can give me no information (long story).\n\nThanks for reading all of that. Does anyone have any feedback for me?

I\u2019m waiting to see a neurologist, but in the meantime saw an Ophthalmologist, who diagnosed me with optic nerve swelling in both eyes, but worse in the left. She wasn\u2019t sure of the cause, told me to keep waiting to see Neurologist.\n\nAbout 3 weeks ago, I started feeling kinda feverish occasionally, I have an annoying tick/spasm above my left eye, and extreme fatigue. I mean *extreme*, like I\u2019m randomly just falling asleep. Generally just feel absolutely worn down & awful.\n\nThen things got weirder about two weeks ago. I started feeling HUGE degrees of low back pain. I can\u2019t stand up for more than a few seconds before it starts to feel like my lower back is being crushed from the back in a kinda downward diagonal direction. When that hits, it\u2019s like my heart goes nuts with palpitations. If I can\u2019t sit down right away, then my chest hurts. I think it\u2019s just from how bad the pain is, and I have a massive pain tolerance! I\u2019m an amputee, I KNOW pain and this is BAD.\n\nFinally, last week, while I was in the bathroom I suddenly felt like something was partially blocking me as I was peeing. Kind of like when you put a thumb up against a faucet and the water spurts out sideways. That lasted a second or so, then I felt like I was being sliced open on the inside, then BAM. The dam broke and I could pee normally, but damn it hurt! And there was some blood. \n\nEver since that happened, on top of everything else, I\u2019m having baaaad pain in my flanks, like someone\u2019s digging their fingers into my kidneys. Fevers are worse, lymph nodes are huge & hard, especially in my neck.\n\nThinking I passed a stone or something, I went to see a urologist. (STILL waiting on Neurology; not till August. Ugh. Not sure why it\u2019s such a delay.) The Urologist was super rude, insisted before he even heard my symptoms that I have interstitial cystitis. But he kept going on about \u201cfrequency & urgency\u201d, which\u2026 I don\u2019t have. Told me I \u201cjust need to stop drinking so much caffeine & artificial sweeteners.\u201d No clue where he got that from, cause I\u2019m allergic to both & avoid them like the plague. The more I think about it, I wonder if he had someone else\u2019s chart or something, cause nothing he said made any sense.\n\nBasically at this point it feels like my symptoms are all over the map, so I have no clue who to see or where to go.

Details inside.\nSummary of medications and procedures:\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------  \nAumentin - 7 day course + 3 additional days\n\nDoxycycline - 7 day course\n\nClindomycin - 7 day course\n\nRocephin - IV antibiotics\n\nX-Ray\n\nUltrasound  \n\\----------------------------------------------------------------  \n\n\nOn June 27th, 2023 I wash bitten by my pet cat on my right index finger where the finger meets the palm. In total, there were 4 significant puncture wounds, two on the palmer side, and two on the back. Patient (I) immediately washed the affected area with soap and water and dressed the wounds with banadages. Within an hour, the finger became inflamed. Not knowing about the severity of cat bites, I went to bed that night expecting the swelling to subside. When it was still swollen in the morning, I decided to go to Urgent Cate (not the ER) after I got off work that evening. That evening, at Urgent Care, the NP examined the finger and reached the same conclusion I had made myself - bacterial infection due to cat bite resulting in cellulitis of the finger, and I was prescribed a 7 day course of Augmentin. I reprimanded myself for not acting sooner, and considered it a hard lesson learned about cat bites. I went home and began my antibiotic regimen, thinking my finger problem would be gone within the week.\n\nSeven days later, to the credit of the antibiotics, the swelling had decreased a bit, but the finger was clearly still swollen and there was still some throbbing pain, so I returned to Urgent Care. I expressed my concerns at this point that there might be something more significant going on with my finger. The NP (a different one this time) examined my finger again, told me that sometimes antibiotics take longer, and prescribed me 3 more days of Augmentin. I left this time unsatisfied.\n\nTwo days later (July 6th, 2023) I made up my mind to go to the emergency room. On the way, my partner suggested (and managed to convince me) to instead go to a nearby Prompt Care instead. Even though I was certain I would receive the same response, I obliged (the reasoning was to save money, even though my insurance would have covered the ER visit). Prompt Care NP looked at my finger, once again. At this point, I had done more research on my own, and my own armchair diagnostic was that I had managed to get a case of flexor tenosynovitis, though I wasn't 100% certain, because I did not meet all four of the Kanavel criteria for a accurate diagnosis. For one, the entirety of my finger wasn't swollen, just around the proximal phalange, and I mistaken assumed that I was able to fully extend the finger without any real pain (I was incorrect on this point.)   \n\n\nI shared my self-diagnosis with the NP, who took me to get X-Rays done of my finger. The findings of X-Rays are as follows:  \n\\-----------------------------------\n\nFindings: The bony structures are intact and normally aligned. The joint spaces are preserved. Soft tissue swelling is seen in the proximal aspect of the index finger.  \n\n\nConclusion: No acute osseous abnormality. Soft tissue swelling in the proximal index finger. No definite foreign bodies are present.  \n\\----------------------------------  \n\n\nIn addition to the X-Ray, this NP prescribed me a 7 day course of Doxycycline, and set me up with a referral to a recommended \"hand specialist\". I left with a little relief, as at least now I would be able to get a hand specialist to confim my suspicions of flexor tenosynovitis or at the very least give me a conclusive reason as to why my finger was still swollen. I called to set up an appointment with the hand specialist and it went to voice mail. I left my name and number and for 2 whole days I did not receive a call back. I was now frustrated at this point, as I had not yet had a definitive answer as to why my finger was swollen, the antibiotics were no longer showing any signs of affect, and I couldn't get ahold of the hand specialist.  On July 14th, 2023, I had reached my breaking point, and drove myself to the nearest ER.  \n\n\nAfter a 7 hour wait (understandable), I was finally face to face with an actual doctor. Took one look at my finger, and after I explained the series of events and my own self diagnosis, he began testing for the 4 Kanavel signs. Turns out, when I was testing for the pain on extension sign, I clearly wasn't pushing hard enough, because when he did it, it was painful. He also scheduled an X-ray, and their X-ray confirmed what the Prompt Care X-ray showed, as mentioned above. At this point, he called for an orthopedic surgeon to come look at my finger. While flexor tenosynovitis was the suspected culprit, the orthopedic surgeon noted that if it was that, that it was strange for the swelling to be localized to just around the proximal phalange, and not the whole finger (sausage finger). He scheduled an ultrasound to be done on my finger later in the week. I was also at this point prescribed a 7 day course of Clindomycin, and was also given IV antibiotics (cefTRIAXone ((Rocephin)). Here is the relevant clinical summary of the attending physician:\n\n\\------------------------------  \nMusculoskeletal: There is focal swelling of the right index finger between MCP and PIP. there is point tenderness. He can range the finger in both flexion and extension. Hyperextension does recreate pain in the finger between the MCP and the PIP. There is no palmar induration or tenderness to examine.\n\nGiven the persistence of swelling on the patient I did consult with orthopedic surgery despite not being an overt tenosynovitis. The consulting doctor was kind enough for ED consultation this morning and feels with the focality of the patient's pain the best management strategy is broadening antibiotics with close follow up which he will provide in his clinic.\n\nPatient previously on Augmentin though it was 500/125 TID for 7 days. Patient is now on doxycycline 100 mg PO BID. Usually this would be combined with clindamycin and that was started in ED as well as a large dose of 3rd generation cephalosporin. The consulting doctor will see the patient in his clinic in 1 week.\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\nOn Wednesday of this week, I went to see the consulting orthopedic doctor, who examined the finger and looked at my finger on the ultrasound. At this point I had more knowledge of flexor tenosynovitis in my head than I ever wanted, and expected to see the cause of my swelling and continued pain show up on the ultrasound in the form of an abscess or pus. I had mentally prepared myself for the ortho doc to confirm my suspicions and tell me that I would have to have surgery to drain the pus out of my finger.\n\nThis did not happen. Ultrasound did not discover any signs of an abscess or any signs of pus. Ortho doc says he has no reason to operate on my finger, because there is nothing to drain. Doc sent me home and told me to continue taking the antibiotics I was prescribed. When I asked then, \"why is my finger still swollen?\" I was not given a conclusive answer - only that injuries on the extremities, especially the hands, can sometimes take a while to heal. I was recommended alternating hot and cold soaks of my finger to see if that would help with the swelling, which is something I've been doing since this whole ordeal started, anyway.\n\nCurrently, the finger is still swollen around the proximal phalange, and from my untrained eye, it seems to be about as inflamed as it was 2 weeks ago. I cannot clench my fist. The index finger is still held in partial flexion. For a mental image, if I attempt to make a hook shape with my index finger, I am unable to do so. I feel pain at the base of the proximal phalange and even a bit around the metacarpal bone of the index finger when i apply significant pressure.\n\nIn summary, I am no closer today of knowing exactly why my finger is still swollen, and the general consensus of all the nurse practitioners and doctors I have talk to is to wait and see. Which, to be clear, is fine *if that is indeed the best course of action.* And that's all the information I have. Hopefully it was informative. I tried to include as much detail as possible. I will close this post with a collection of images of the finger. These were taken last week, but as far as I can tell, the finger looks the same today as it did then. \n\nUltimately, what I'm looking for in a reply here is if the \"Wait and see\" option is the correct course here. I'm wondering if somebody missed something. It has been swollen for nearly a month now, and I have bombarded this finger with a multitudinous payload of antibiotics, and they don't seem to be doing anything.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my post.\n\n[Image 1 - Front of finger](https://imgur.com/a/ixRNg4C)\n\n[Image 2 - Back of Finger](https://imgur.com/a/KNx0row)\n\n[Image 3 -  Side of finger / how far it can currently bend](https://imgur.com/a/f76Z0Hu)\n\n[Image 4 - Side of finger (attempt at holding all fingers in hyper extension)](https://imgur.com/a/SdOuDJu)\n\n[Image 5 - Left Hand side view for comparison of left index finger and right index finger.](https://imgur.com/a/QX4AHOr)  \n",

        "context": "How to Manage a Pinched Nerve in Neck/Shoulder at Work?\nHello, I (25F) am currently dealing with what I believe is a pinched nerve. \n\nThis recent bout of pain started as soon as I got a job working at a grocery store. I do a lot of cashiering, and I constantly have to move my left arm to grab things. I cannot take any days off because my bf just lost his job abruptly and we won\u2019t be able to pay rent if I don\u2019t finish the pay period. I also can\u2019t see a doctor because I need all of my money for bills and don\u2019t have insurance (meaning they will ask me to pay upfront). \n\nThe pain is mainly near my left shoulder blade where it dips and meets my traps. The pain radiates around my shoulder and occasionally on the back left side of my neck. Numbness will radiate down my left arm, specifically when I\u2019m trying to gwt rest at night and I lay on my back. Less so when I lay on my opposite side, but it\u2019s still uncomfortable enough to keep me awake. \n\nI have been to PT twice for an issue with my hip joint on the same side. The first time I was being treated for sciatica and the second time for SI Joint Inflammation. I\u2019ve had no imaging, but an x-ray that shows L5 sacrialization on the left side. Not sure if this is relevant, but I read that a joint issue on one part can affect how the other joints overcompensate so I wanted to add that just in case.\n\nI also injured my neck doing a dance back in 2020 and was unable to move it properly for months. The pain didn\u2019t go away fully until about 6 months later. I didn\u2019t go to a doctor for obvious reasons at the time. \n\nWhat can I do to manage this at home and at work to help treat it, or at the very least keep it from getting worse. I\u2019m even fine with just making it manageable for now, but I have no idea. All of the stretches online irritate it more and I feel like I can\u2019t rest. Ibuprofen only helped a little, not much unfortunately. Any suggestions would be appreciated!",

Every time I go pee only a little bit comes out.  I go back to bed and maybe 15 minus later the urge comes back. This happened a off and on during Thursday and Friday as well.  I just tried to ignore it and get some sleep, but I still got up at least 5 time each night.\n\nThere is no burning, discharge,  smell, discoloration, or anything, but I feel minor pressure in my lower abdomen when this occurs.  I have not changed my diet, exercise routine, or anything like that.  I drink Kombucha everyday to keep up my gut flora.  I also drank 2x as much water Friday than normal to try to flush things out so my pee was basically clear.\n\nSo, I was going to go to urgent care today (Saturday), but I sept though the night like a baby.  I had the lower abdomen pressure when I went to bed, but it was gone when I woke up today.  I got a good 9 hours of sleep and feel great today. Maybe some very very minor urge to pee, but I wonder if that's a phantom sense since I'm constantly checking if I still have the urge.  If I just don't think about it then there is no urge like previously.\n\nAnyways should I still go to urgent care? I would have to pay out of pocket if I did go.  All of my symptoms have basically disappeared since I woke up today.\n\nI'm thinking of buying some Cranberry juice and seeing what happens incase it's some minor UTI.  I have not had coitus with anybody for over a year, so it's not a STD.  I did masturbate Tuesday night before bed and the urges showed up Wednesday night so maybe something happened there.\n\nThanks for any advice.",

So scared and confused.\nI had a bilateral salpingectomy and have taken five positive pregnancy tests. Did my doctor mess up? Forget to do it and altered the chart? I am so confused.\n\nF32 5'3' 130lbs\nMedications: celexa (anxiety), Adderall (ADHD), potassium citrate (kidney stones)\n\nMy baby is 17 months and it was a very traumatic birth. I had cesarean scheduled at 39 weeks, but she decided to come earlier than that at 38 weeks. Unfortunately, that meant the on call doctor was going to deliver her. From several past bad experiences I didn't have confidence in her ability as a doctor, but baby is coming, so not really up to me. She complained to the nurse that she had to come in after dinner for me so I already had the impression her headspace was not where it needed to be. \n\nShe didn't look at my chart, or not closely to see that I had an anterior placenta. I hemorrhaged and they couldn't get her out for what felt like forever. I see a ton of people rushing in and when she's out she's not breathing and everyone is working on her. The doctor is doing all the rest of the stuff and when the sheet is moved her and the nurse's face are absolutely covered in blood. She was frazzled and very nervous. My baby comes around and by the 5 minute APGAR is at 9 instead of 1 and didn't even need to be in the NICU. I am so thankful and it was the scariest time of my life.\n\nBut my question is: could she have botched my bilateral salpingectomy? Could she have maybe forgotten to even do it? I know that doctors are used to high stress and what is scary to me may not be to them, but this person was obviously not ok. She was shaking and pale and very nervous when the curtain came down and I was stitched up. Or did she not see that I was to have a bi salp after delivery? If she looked at my chart, it wasn't very closely. I did mention it in the beginning to her, but with the scary event and the fact that she didn't seem very interested in what I had to say, I'm wondering if it was even done or done accurately. How could this happen? Can anyone offer insight into this? \n\nI did look up her reports to verify if it was done. They are not detailed at all. Doesn't mention a salpingectomy at all, glosses over the blood loss and even though it was more than 1800 she said it was \"no more than expected\" in her report. Didn't say anything about my baby not breathing or any mention of the placenta whatsoever. For being in there for 90 minutes, it was very, very short. \n\nLabs mention the fallopian tubes, but no detail besides the exact same descriptors for each, like they could have been copied and pasted identically. I am freaking out. I don't understand and I need to hear from professionals any likely scenario. I am NOT going back to that doctor. She will never treat me again.",

I have all 4 wisdom teeth, all of them are impacted to varying degrees, but they've never caused me issues so I've never bothered to get them out. All but one of them are at least partially erupted.\n\nStarting at least within the past two weeks(I can't really recall), my top left wisdom tooth has been pretty sensitive to cold, enough so that it hurts/stings if I swish around cool water. That tooth is erupted and I believe mildly impacted. It doesn't hurt at all otherwise, just sensitivity to cold. My overall dental health is honestly not the best, I'm not great at brushing twice a day, but last time I went to the dentist(about 6 months ago) I don't believe they found anything. That's of course before this problem started. I grind my teeth a lot, so this could be related.\n\nI'm really just wondering how likely it is that I can get out of this without any dental work. I don't have time for a full extraction right now, so I bought some sensodyne and hoping that works, and that this'll go away eventually. How possible is that?",

        "context": "Should I be concerned about type 2 diabetes\nHello! I am 27, female, BMI around 23. I have a past medical history of anorexia in which my bmi was as low as 16, but I have been in recovery for 4 years. I\u2019ve had 1 pregnancy that was uncomplicated with a healthy full term baby. I take 40 mg Prozac for anxiety, 60 mg vyvanse for ADHD, and PRN Ativan 0.5 mg, I probably take the Ativan on average 1/month for anxiety or insomnia.\n\nWhen I had an eating disorder and it was really bad, I would get these daily episodes of weakness, twitching, fatigue, and headache. This started after years of having anorexia. I had a grand mal seizure in 2017 due to deficient electrolytes. Although my numbers were not actually flagged as abnormal upon lab work at the ER, they were the lowest \u201cnormal\u201d value, my tox screen was negative, and I followed up with neuro which was negative for anything neurological so they said the seizure was from my ED. I never had another seizure. I figured these daily episodes were caused by hypoglycemia or dehydration.\n\nThese episodes did disappear after I regained weight and health. During the beginning of my recovery, I was pregnant so I was off of all medication and really trying to be mindful of my food and water intake. After having my son, I would sometimes get the episodes again especially after having caffeine on an empty stomach or not eating much all day. I again assumed it was low blood sugar.\n\nNow I have been on stimulants for ADHD for the past year and it has really improved my life. I am a new nurse, so the medication is really important to me so I can do my job thoroughly. I\u2019ve had no negative side effects such as nausea or loss of appetite. Sometimes I get heart palpitations if I drink caffeine near the time I took my Vyvanse, but that\u2019s about it. However, I\u2019ve recently been getting the episodes frequently again. I attributed it to the stimulants wearing off, which it likely could be a vyvanse \u201ccrash\u201d as they call it. I always take my medication with food, specifically protein, and be sure to eat and drink throughout the day. It doesn\u2019t seem to help the afternoon episodes.\n\nToday, I was out with family at a tea shop and I got a sugary drink (caffeine free) and a macaron. About an hour after eating, and while still finishing the drink, the \u201cepisode\u201d started. Headache, nausea, dry mouth, sweating. I got home and checked my glucose and it read 140. This I know is technically normal, but is it \u201cborderline\u201d? Should I, with these sx, be concerned about hyperglycemia? Sometimes sugar fixes the symptoms and sometimes it causes them. Not really sure what to think of this. Maybe I just need to drink way more water?",

Up until recently I have always had normal results for all three.\n\nMy TV ultrasound was done on 7/5/23. Last week Friday, 7/14/23 my gyno called me at 5pm with the results. She informed me I have two ovarian cysts in my left ovary. I was shocked because I haven't had any symptoms. My periods are VERY regular and have never been heavy. I was shocked and didn't ask questions. She said someone would call me to schedule a follow up ultrasound and I said okay. \n\nI looked at my file and these are the actual results: 4.9 and 2.8 cm hypoechoic left ovarian lesions, possibly reflecting hemorrhagic ovarian cysts. Follow up could be considered. the left ovary measures 4.9 x 6.2 x 5.3 cm, with 2 complex hypoechoic structures with multiple septations, including the 4.9 x 4.4 x 4.4 cm and a 2.8 x 2 x 2.5 cm. \n\nThis is when I started to panic.

Had 4 appointments in the last 5 years to remove buildup of earwax\n\n- Recently picked outer ear hairs with tweezers\n\n- I do not use Q-tips or touch my ear often, but recently have touching it more due to itchiness\n\n- I often grind my teeth in my sleep. My medications make me do this more.\n\n\n[Current medications]\n\n- Concerta 54mg\n\n- Prozac 30mg\n\n\n[Issue]\n\n- 3 weeks ago, felt itchiness as if ear hairs tickling my ear, so I purchased tweezers and picked the hairs from outer ear\n\n- 1 week ago, the problem didn't go away. Used a metal srynge filled with water to flush my ear. No change\n\n- 6 days ago, purchased a  camera tool to look inside of my ear. Found something that looks like a lump (cyst?). Images attached below\n\n- ~3 days ago, applied an antibiotic gel to the left outer ear\n\n- 1 day ago, reapplied the antibiotic gel\n\n- itchiness and odd feeling of pressure has not gone away as of today\n\n- Scheduled an appointment with an otolaryngologist, in ~2-3 weeks\n\n\n\n[Question]\n\nIs this issue urgent?

I had routine blood work in 2019 that showed mild hypercalcemia. Blood work was then repeated in 2020 showing the same. After the second case of this my doctor ran PTH, ionized calcium, and vitamin D blood work. This time calcium came back within range as did ionized calcium and PTHrP was low and PTH intact was low normal. Vitamin D showed I was deficient so doctor said this was probably the cause. Now 2023 just got routine blood work back and there it is hypercalcemia again fueling my anxiety. The results are detailed below I am extremely worried as of course have read online detailing that the only real 2 causes of this are parathyroid tumor(which was ruled out by PTH) and Cancer. \n\nCalcium\n10.5 - 2019\n10.6 - 2020\n10.3 - 2020\n10.8 - 2023\n\nIonized Calcium \n\n5.2 - 2020\n\nAlbumin -\n5.2 - 2019\n4.9 - 2020\nNot tested again in 2020\n5.3 - 2023\n\nPTH - 19 - 2020\nPTHrp - 13 - 2020\n\nI have read all on norman parathyroid website and they detail that the upper limit fo calcium is 10.7 for my age but results say different just looking for some information on this as I read that cancer tends to cause hypercalcemia in advanced stages and with a poor prognosis but I dont have any issues and have been living with this apparentely for 4+ years.\n\nThanks",

        "context": "Facial pain / osteoma (26m)\nHi guys. I\u2019ve had this chronic pain on the left hand side between my nose/sinus/teeth for years. The dentist ruled out a dental cause and suggested seeing an ENT.\n\nI had a scan done and the ENT said there was \u2018white\u2019 on the region of the scan and he didn\u2019t know what it was. So he referred me to another ENT department he thought could help.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t access his scan and to my recollection they ordered another one. They told me that they found an osteoma at the exact location of my pain, however they don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for an osteoma to cause facial pain. So they referred me to a pain clinic who said it was \u2018idiopathic facial pain\u2019 and probably neurological in origin. They said my best bet was seeing a \u2018pain psychologist\u2019 and taking nerve pain medication (which hasn\u2019t helped at all).\n\nI felt I wanted a second opinion on the osteoma and the pain, and finally got seen again by the ENT. They stated they couldn\u2019t access either of my scans, and had no record of the second scan and that it probably \u2018didn\u2019t happen\u2019 (it did). Nonetheless, he still was adamant that the osteoma couldn\u2019t cause facial pain and that pain psychology was the only treatment.\n\nNow, every study I have read states that sinus osteomas can and often do cause facial pain.\n\n\u2018The most common symptom of paranasal osteomas is pain including headache and facial pain (Atallah and Jay, 1981).\u2019 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319453411001044#:~:text=The%20clinical%20presentation%20of%20paranasal,Atallah%20and%20Jay%2C%201981).\n\nIt seems bizarre to me that there would be an osteoma at the exact location of the pain that\u2019s unrelated. What\u2019s even more bizarre to me is being told it can\u2019t cause facial pain when every study says it does.\n\nNow I\u2019m not certain this is the cause of the pain. However it confused me. Furthermore, I am not happy with the idiopathic/nerve diagnosis. They arrived at that from simply not finding another cause, and it really doesn\u2019t feel like a nerve problem to me (it feels very structural/physical, largely affected by pressure, I can feel/hear liquid/fluid opening closing etc).\n\nThey have stated they are going to try and locate the past scan, however that was from 4 years ago. I will pursue a new scan, but i am not convinced of whether the response will be any better.\n\nAny thoughts or advice would be useful!\n\nThanks",

Wednesday, I made sure I was definitely hydrated and drank around 2L+ just in the afternoon, but still had that extremely strong urine smell and noticed it looked much darker than it should having just drank that much water over a few hours. \n\nThursday afternoon, still having the strong urine, I started to feel like my bladder was still full after peeing. This is when I caught on that something definitely was not right and suspected a possible UTI but had no pain at all. I had possibly used the bathroom a little more than usual that day, though nothing drastically noticeable, but as the afternoon progressed I was peeing small amounts quite frequently with a lot of discomfort around my bladder area. \n\nI went and saw my GP who used one of those dip sticks and said my urine looked fine and that the stick only showed a very small amount of white blood cells. She sent it off for a urine culture test and gave me a script for antibiotics but told me not to take them until they get the results back on Saturday and will call me if it's positive for a UTI, unless it gets worse. \n\nThat brings me today,  Friday. My urine smelled strong this morning but is ok now. Around noon, I started to experience pain on both my sides and my back. I've not got my results back but bought and started the antibiotics (Cefalexin 500mg, twice a day). \n\nI haven't been feeling the bladder fullness since this morning or needing to pee since around noon. Throughout this whole experience, I've experienced no pain while urinating at all and have had no blood in my urine and I don't have a fever. \n\nAt the moment I'm mostly experiencing a sharp pain on my left side, with occasional pain on the right side. There is pain when I press on my left side. It gets worse when I walk and move around. \n\nWhile the pain started by being there pretty consistently on both sides while at work (mostly driving and standing), its now an on and off stabbing pain that lasts a few seconds while sitting or laying down, or consistently there when walking. \n\nThe pain isn't unbearable, if I get a bad stab it's maybe gotten to a 6 or so and makes me jump. It's mostly just really uncomfortable and annoying. \n\nOriginally I thought my UTI may have turned into a kidney infection but now I'm wondering if I have stones. I also started Aspen Dexamphetamine about 9 days ago, prescribed my by Psychiatrist for ADHD. No other medication or medical conditions other than PCOS.\n\nMy plan is to continue the antibiotics and go back to my doctor if it doesn't go away or to ER if the pain gets severe. \n\nAny thoughts?

So, when I was younger I had semi-frequent episodes of diarrhea, then in my late teens/early 20s I started frequently having to strain to have bowel movements but also getting intermittent diarrhea, then the diarrhea subsided aside from rare occasion and I progressed from just having to strain to have a bowel movement to having to rock back and forth/side to side, to sometimes having to insert my fingers in my rectum to digitally remove feces, to basically becoming dependent on digital removal and enemas to have a bowel movement by my mid-20s. \r  \n\r  \nI brought this up to my PCP who first suggested I try various OTC laxatives (which didn\u2019t really do much), then later referred me to a gastroenterologist who recommended fiber and put me on lactulose, which I tried for around a few months which either did nothing or a couple times gave me uncontrollable explosive diarrhea with no therapeutic range where I could just have a normal bowel movement. I finally got the GI doc to give me a colonoscopy which came back normal, so he told me to just continue with the fiber and laxatives which were already not helping, so I basically just gave up on getting professional help for a while.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m now almost 35 and trying to take my health more seriously, and as a registered nurse I know that what I\u2019m experiencing is not normal and needs further evaluation. I go on bouts (I know I should be more consistent but struggle due to the untreated ADHD, also on the waitlist for a behavioral health provider) of taking fiber, magnesium citrate, and pre-/pro-biotics which are helping some, and I\u2019m basically to the point where I can sometimes initiate a BM naturally (especially if I wait longer than usual/comfortable once I\u2019ve had the sensation that I need to go) but still not go completely without digital stool removal or using an enema for the rest.\r  \n\r  \nOther relevant information:\r  \n\\-My stool is usually medium-brown in color, soft-formed or mushy, rarely hard/pebbly, I often express clear mucus from my rectum with or without stool, occasionally thick whitish stringy material in stool itself, and I\u2019ve noticed that some of the time when I have a BM without assistance it is very narrow (around finger-width) and sort of flat as if my internal anal sphincter doesn\u2019t like to fully/easily open (often feels like this when I insert fingers as well).\r  \n\\-I often have BLQ abdominal tenderness to palpation.\r  \n\\-I do get rare shooting pain from my anus to my penis; only happened a handful of times or so and seems random/unrelated to bowel movements or assisted stool removal.\r  \n\\-I have a small nodule (maybe pen-tip size if that) in my posterior rectum about 1 inch in (appeared \\~1.5 years ago, is small, soft, and has not grown in size; assessed by a family practice doc who gave me a referral to infectious disease despite all my STI tests coming back negative, that office said I should get a referral to a colo-rectal specialist, so I told the ordering doc and he just never got back to me). I assume it\u2019s from all the mild trauma initiated by digital insertion, enemas, and occasional anal sexual activity (see below) but don\u2019t know for sure.\r  \n\\-I do \u201cbottom\u201d and use anal sex toys a few times a year and have done so since my early teens, but I frequently avoid such activities due to my GI issues.\r  \n\r  \nSorry for the long-winded post, but I have a physical w/ my PCP next month and hope to have some suggestions of what to explore/tell her and maybe some advice of what I can do on my own to help. This has been a major and shameful struggle in my life for well over a decade now, and I just want it to go away. Thank you in advance!\r  \n",

Around two months ago I started experiencing chest pain it started off low and increased in severity. After one day when I got angry I felt the pain radiate through my left arm all the way to my heart. I went to the ER and the ecg was normal but the attending physician heard my heart through a stethoscope and recommended seeing a cardiologist. \n\nAfter multiple tests with the cardiologist he said I had mild moderate mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation. However, he insisted that it has nothing to do with the chest pain and it is caused by stress and anxiety. He basically told me to go and speak to a psychiatrist. This was end of May, the pain has not gone away at all. I went to another cardiologist that said the same thing. I spoke to a third cardiologist and he said to take it easy and not move much but thats about it. The problem is that this pain is becoming debilitating and because it hurts I cannot stop thinking about it. \n\nThe pain can be described as a pressure in the heart or stabbing, my arm sometimes feels numb or sore. It is sometimes accompanied by nausea and lightheadedness as well as fatigue. All depends on the day somedays it can be bearable others not really. \n\nAny help about this is appreciated.  thank you",

I struggled with constipation and feeling like I was never finished when I went to the bathroom. I had mucus in stool and on the rare occasion that I would get pain from constipation lasting too long,  I would have these brief fainting spells or just feel really dizzy.\n\nMoving forward to now I've been suffering from stomach pain since the start of this year in my lower abdomen around my belly button and pelvis- mainly situated in the center and left side, constantly going back and forth between constipation and diarrhea, with nothing subsiding the pain aside from eating which slightly lessened it until I hurt even worse at night. Between the pain and the fatigue it brought with it, I've been unable to carry on with my usual activities and mostly find myself lying in pain for most of the day. I first went to my PCP who sent out abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds, as well as blood tests testing for celiac, all of which came back normal.\n\nUpon following up with my GI doctor I did a colonoscopy, in which I was unable to properly do the prep as the solution made me nauseous and so some areas were not clear. He told me however that my results were normal aside from some small hemorrhoids. I later did a H. Pylori breath test, as my dad had gotten it around this time, which came back negative. I recently did an endoscopy where a biopsy was sent which was found to be normal aside from mild gastritis, which brings me here.\n\nAside from potentially repeating the colonoscopy or doing a CT scan- which terrifies me because of the radiation- I don't know where to turn next, and hate that there almost seems to be no root cause to my symptoms. Has anyone else experienced anything similar, or potentially know what condition this may sound similar to? Could it really just be IBS? I'm so exhausted.",

Or just something somatic?\nF28, 160 cm, 70 kg\r  \nMedication: 2x20mg omeprazole, 1 one billion unit probiotic, and 3x60 mg alverine and simethicone daily for a colitis flareup (prescribed for a month, I\u2019m starting the third week), plus 1x500 mg extended release metformin, 2 myo-inositol, 1 vitamin D supplement daily, and .025mg cabergoline weekly to treat PCOS and elevated prolactin levels (prescribed for three months before checkup, also starting the third week)\r  \n\r  \nOn January I went to a GP about another colitis flareup, my main symptoms were bloating and starting to feel some fatigue. The GP only did a physical checkup, didn\u2019t ask for blood tests or other analysis. I complained mostly about pain/discomfort on my right side, right under the ribcage, and she told me she was ruling out liver problems on the basis alone that the pain didn\u2019t worsen in the area while she was feeling around. She prescribed me a week-long treatment and I felt a lot better.\r  \n\r  \nAround May I began experiencing a lot of stress and noticed I began bloating again, but due to financial problems I could only ignore it. It worsened with time, albeit slightly, and just at the beginning of July I was able to invest in getting checkups again.\r  \n\r  \nI started with a gynecologist due to some discomfort on my breasts, which to be honest caused me to panic and stress even more over the fear of it being breast cancer, but after an ultrasound and blood test, the doctor explained it was only an increase on my prolactin levels, a vitamin D deficiency and a couple of hormones having inverted values, as well as my insulin resistance flaring up again. I must admit I spent almost everyday at home until very recently, and my diet is/was not the best, so the vitamin D deficiency didn\u2019t really come as a surprise (from a baseline of =<30, I had 9.43). Still, the almost three-week waiting period raised up hell in my already uncomfortable gut.\r  \n\r  \nI took those blood work results to a gastroenterologist in case they were useful to her, since I read that vitamin D and prolactin are metabolized through the liver, but she disregarded them quickly. My symptoms were the same as the ones in January: I was uncomfortably bloated, spicy and greasy foods, which I had been honestly abusing lately, weren\u2019t sitting right with me and I had occasional diarrhea, although with no blood on sight. I also felt discomfort on my right side, right under my ribcage, again. During the physical checkup she also semi-ruled out liver problems, but still asked for a liver and bile duct ultrasound and a 32-element blood work to make sure.\r  \n\r  \nThe ultrasound report says: \"Moderate grade fatty liver, cholelithiasis without bile duct dilation\", and recommended to check certain values, which are as follows (I\u2019ll include the lab baseline values in parenthesis next to my values, since I live outside the USA and don\u2019t know if they vary):\r  \nAlbumin: 4.80 (3.97-4.94)\r  \nAlkaline phosphatase: 75.1 (35.0-104.0)\r  \nBilirubin: 0.57 (<=1.20)\r  \nALT: 32.9 (<=33.0)\r  \nAST: 21.9 (<=32.0)\r  \nGGT: 16.4 (<=40.0)\r  \n\r  \nThe ultrasound also recommended to check TP, TPT and prothrombin time, but my initial blood work didn\u2019t include it.\r  \n\r  \nThe gastroenterologist said she would let me know if it was necessary to go see her earlier when I sent my results, otherwise she would see me in a month. She only confirmed she had received my blood work and ultrasounds and didn\u2019t add anything else, so I\u2019m assuming I\u2019ll see her at the beginning of August.\r  \n\r  \nNow, starting on the third week of all the medicine I have to take, I\u2019ve noticed only small changes: I\u2019m not as bloated, but I\u2019m still bloated. I\u2019m not really feeling hungry (but I have to admit, I\u2019m also a very anxious person and normally during elevated anxiety periods I lose appetite completely). I burp after eating anything, no matter how little it is (for example, I burped after having two peach gummies the other day). My bowel movements go from slight constipation to slight diarrhea and they are consistently a soft brown color (I wouldn\u2019t call it clay-colored, but it\u2019s definitely lighter than my normal bowel movements). The general discomfort under my right ribcage has improved considerably, although when I get nervous/anxious I feel it. But now, every now and then, I feel little, very defined stabby pains in that area, instead of just general discomfort/ache. I would describe them as someone poking me with a sharp object. The pain lasts a few seconds at most and then goes away, but it leaves me scared. I\u2019m also sometimes dizzy and slightly nauseous, but haven\u2019t really thrown up during the treatment (and even before that, in a long time).\r  \n\r  \nNow, the thing is I don\u2019t know if these could be gallbladder attacks or the fatty liver acting up. Even if I go to sleep feeling those discomforts, I always wake up without them. Sometimes symptoms start shortly after waking up, but I\u2019ve noticed that happens only on days when I\u2019m feeling overtly-anxious and obsessively scanning my body. I can exercise without a problem and I\u2019ve noticed that even improves my overall perceived state. Still no blood on sight in my stool, and no traces of jaundice in my skin or eyes, although my eyes have also been very dry and kinda bloodshot, if that could be relevant?\r  \n\r  \nCould someone give me an insight of what could be happening? I must admit, again, that I have horrible health anxiety, so my fears range from gallstone attacks, to liver problems, to some sort of cancer (no other reason other than some blood values being so high while others are normal, though I admit I know nothing about it so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s truly an indication of something being severely wrong), so I don\u2019t know if I should go see another gastroenterologist sooner and push for an endoscopy/colonoscopy/something of the sort right now, or just wait a couple weeks more to see what my doc has to say. I\u2019d appreciate any comment.",

(1.5M)\nHello,\n\nMy son: 1 and a half year old male, 25lbs, 35 inches, white, no health issues other than constipation. \n\nI've posted before about my son's (1.5 year old) chronic constipation. My question is, how exactly does constipation happen in the bowels? If my son takes high enough doses of stool softeners and laxatives, he'll have one or two mushy poops per day. If he misses a dose or gets a smaller dose, the next day he will still poop, but it will be hard and small. The next day pebbles, and the day after that, he stops pooping altogether. When he gets back on the laxatives, he will go back and forth between pooping water and pooping pebbles until his stool gets back to normal consistency & frequency. \n\nHow could he go from soft wet poops to hard poops within a day? Wouldn't it need to be in his colon longer to get that hard? Does it mean that too much water is being pulled from his intestines? He doesn't seem dehydrated - he wets diapers well, has a wet mouth, cries tears, and drinks water all day long as well as milk bottles. He also eats lots of fiber. \n\nThank you! ",

I repeat words and phrases many times in my head after I utter them out loud which I never did before. The depth and breadth of my thoughts are shallow.

It's not something I could live with until recently and made plans to kill myself many times in the past 2 years because of it. I never followed through with the plans though. I've heard about depression induced pseudodementia and it sounds like a possible cause for my failing mental state. The shame and stress caused from confronting that part of my identity also made me physically sick for months and made my skin hypersensitive to touch and temperature as well.

I live in Southern California, I am a 5'7\" 140lb 27 Y/O Male who is very athletic. I eat clean, I exercise regularly, and take multivitamins. \n\nI was two months into the Sheriff academy when on the weekend of June 10th 2023 I got sick. Headache, nausea, chest congestion and an overall feeling of exhaustion. I've been sick before, so this wasn't alarming. I was coughing up yellow/green phlegm that following week, and was trying to dial it down but the intensity of the sheriff academy, my pride, and pushy instructors who don't \"allow you\" to be sick got the better of me, and I trained through it. Over the next few week I felt off but generally okay, all symptoms had subsided except I was coughing up green phlegm still, and I felt like I was operating at 70% capacity. I was still running 7-9 Miles at a 7 Minute flat pace, but I felt terrible doing it. At this time I was living in barracks housing, which was old, dirty, and there was mold present in some areas. \n\nFast forward a few weeks, I choose to remove myself from the academy for a variety of reasons, my wife and daughter needed me at home, my daughter is autistic and being away for weeks at a time was too hard on her, I was still sick, and ultimately I felt the job wasn't for me. Still coughing up green phlegm on Jun 26th I went to urgent care. The Physician I saw said I probably have bronchitis and prescribed the following:\n\ndoxycycline (MONODOX) 100 MG capsule (2 a day for 10 days)\r  \nalbuterol 108 (90 Base) MCG/ACT inhaler\r  \nmethylprednisolone (MEDROL DOSEPACK) 4 MG tablet (6-5-4-3-2-1 daily doses)\n\nI took 9 days worth of the antibiotic, but it was making me feel worse, and I skipped the last dose the 10th day. I took the steroid, as directed, with the exception of one day where I missed one of the four doses. \n\nAfter all that, I developed bad sinus pressure and nasal congestion, and the chest congestion was still present. I don't have the urge to cough, but when I exhale hard and deep, or \"Huff\" I can hear the crackling and can cough up the green mucus. Usually by the afternoon I feel halfway decent and most of my congestion has eased. But the next day I start all over again; plugged nose, green mucus, chest congestion, face pressure. I live at elevation and when I drive down the hill for work I get plugged up, ear pain, and sinus pressure. OTC stuff doesn't seem to help.\n\nI went back to the same urgent care on 7/14, the PA who saw me essentially told me to continue waiting it out, was very dismissive of me, and reluctantly ordered chest and sinus X-Rays of which I am still awaiting results.\n\nUltimately, as of today I am still sick, closing in on 40 days straight of CRAP! I have never been sick for this long in my entire life. Am I overthinking it? Do I just keep waiting? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nANY ADVICE IS GREATLY APPRECIATED, and I will promptly answer any questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks\n\n&#x200B;",

Though I'm looking to get some information to help deal over the weekend.\n\nI say I'm constipated, but I still poop everyday.  Though starting on Wednesday  I was not getting complete evacuation.  I would poop an ok looking log, but it felt more was in there that did not want to come out.\n\nWednesday night I could feel bloating and that poop was backing up.  This happened again Thursday with my morning poop not getting everything to come out.\n\nI have been eating healthy, exercising, and loss a bunch of weight this year.  I cut out all Alcohol, candy, soda, junk food, milk, ice cream, and really revamped my whole diet to be healthy.  I don't smoke, do drugs, or on any kind of medication.   I try to keep good gut health drinking kombucha for the probiotics and all that stuff.\n\nRecently in the last few weeks I've been concentrating on eating more fiber to bulk up my poops a little bit more as I felt they were a touch loose.  I may have over did it as this may have caused my constipation as I was not drinking enough liquids to offset the increase in fiber.\n\nA side effect of this constipation seems to be the need to pee often, though when I pee not a lot comes out.  This usually happens at night after dinner and gets worst while I'm trying to sleep.  It's to the point that I'm try to pee, I feel like I'm done, go back to bed and 5 minutes later I have the I need to pee feeling again.\n\nSo I was talking with a friend yesterday about my constipation and they said a salt cleanse helped them in the past to get things moving.  So I read up on that yesterday and it seemed simple enough to try.  I did it first thing this morning and boy did lots of poop and sludge come out.\n\nI probably pooped water on and off for 30 minutes. At the end the water was pretty clear so I felt like it did it's job.  I did instantly feel better the rest of the morning.  I ate a egg and avocado sandwich for lunch, 5 hours after pooping water, to keep things light and have drank lots of water and a Kombucha today to rehydrate for all that lost water.\n\nOne thing in particular is the need to pee often with not much coming out has not gone away. I have had that pretty much all afternoon and still have it now as I type this post.  I'm been doing some Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles the last hour and that seem to have help things a bit.\n\nI still feel like I have to pee, but it's more an annoying feeling of something in the chamber then I have to pee right now.  I'm not sure if this matter, but it's a data point.\n\nSo now one thing I did Tuesday night, that may be important, was have some bedroom fun with my girlfriend.  So now I enjoy edging and she loves taking the dominate role at times.  So on this night we went at it where she basically controlled when and how I would cum.\n\nWe got to a point where I was rock hard riding the edge as she was stroking me.  At one point I felt the urge to pee and I said I have to pee.  She played her dominate role and say no peeing.\n\nHonestly I kind of liked it. The urge to pee while riding the edge, felt great.  So I went with it and didn't use our safe word to stop.\n\nIf anything I felt even harder having to pee and riding the edge.  My girlfriend was loving it, even commenting how much harder I was than normal.  This lasted for at least 45 minutes before I ejaculated and my penis had this vibrating feeling that was out of this world.\n\nAt that point I still had to great urge to pee but I was rock hard from all of the stimulation.  This made peeing pretty difficult, but I pushed it out.  I will say pushing out the pee was not smooth in the sense that t was kind of stop and start peeing.   In hindsight this may have not been the best move.\n\nThough I noticed \\~15 minutes later when I was completely soft that I felt like I had to pee again.  I went and only a dribble came out.\n\nI tell you all this because that urge to pee feeling I get now, feels pretty much the same as that urge to pee after 15 minutes I just mentioned.  If I do pee more the a dribble then it's has this stop and stop feel to it as well when I try to relax the muscle holding the pee back.  I don't know if they are related or just coincidence, but I felt it was worth a note.\n\nAnyways if anybody has some advice fore getting through the weekend that would be great.  I have no idea what tomorrow will bring and if all my issues will just go away with a night of sleet, but I'm looking for an opinion / some advice.\n\nMy doctor's office did not think this was an emergency, so I should not have much to worry about, but this urge to pee is pretty annoying.   It's been a little over an hour since I last peed as the Kegel exercises I talked about above seem to setting things down.  It's more of a tingle now then an all out I have to pee.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions and I apologize for any bad grammar or spelling.  Thanks for any help.\n\n&#x200B;",

Did I have a penis removed at birth?\nPrimary Concern: I have an unknown scar, and am paranoid if it is from a surgery shortly after my birth.\n\nAge: 18  \nSex: Female (?)  \nheight: 166cm (\\~5'6'')  \nweight: 48kg (106lbs)  \nrace: chinese\n\nI have a vertical scar that is a perfectly straight line from right below my bellybutton to my vaginal area (as far as I can tell). I think it would be classified as normotrophic? The scar's not raised or textured, but noticably darker and looks similar to when I get minor wounds and after they've completely closed up, but are still visible as temporary scars (lasting maybe a few months). \n\nI have had this scar for my whole life, have never had a surgery relating to anywhere on my torso or reproductive parts, and never sustained severe injuries in this region. My bellybutton has no irregular scarring or shaping, so I don't think it's a result of umbilical cord removal.\n\nHere's where the interesting stuff comes up. I was abandoned as an infant in China during the one-child policy. I have all the reproductive parts and functions of a female (breasts, periods, reproductive parts), and I am apathetic to my own gender expression. Because of this gender apathy, one time when I mentioned the mystery scar to my friend, they sarcastically said \"maybe you were a hermaphrodite and your chinese parents cut your penis off so that you'd get adopted.\" that sounds ridiculous, and I know that intersex people don't simply have both sets of genitalia (at least not fully functioning), but honestly in my mind it's not an impossibility, and I can't help but wonder if I am actually intersex, but my bio family or whoever was there for my birth, to remove any irregular genitals so that I would have a better chance at getting adopted. \n\nThere is a rumour that floats around the Chinese-Adoption sphere that sometimes abandoned children would have a strange and unique scar so that if need be in the future, the bio parents could identify their child. I've heard a lot of mixed things about the reality of this, but it is true that when I was adopted, I had a scar on my leg that looked like a messy burn scar from a metal brand. It stayed visible on me for the first 12 years of my life before eventually fading. In China, the orphanages usually house children with disabilities or birth defects more than any other demographic because \"normal\" babies are sent out for adoption (like what happened to me).\n\nMy current family doctor's earliest records of me are from when I started the immigration process, so the first year of my life has no medical record of what could have been done. It is also possible that my actual date of birth is incorrect since the orphanage assigned a predicted date when finding me abandoned. \n\nIn blood tests, I have the following irregularities:\n\n* elevated RBC\n* below average MCV\n* elevated triglycerides\n* extremely low ferritin\n\nMy doctor has diagnosed me with thalassemia, and other than that, I have no other official diagnosis or treatments. Is it actually possible that I was born interssex? If not, what could this scar be from?",

Jesus Christ this is horrible and I really need some medical advice\nSo I (22F) was fine and normal until a couple days ago\u2026.I live in New York and a couple days ago, the air quality increased badly. I did not know this until I was already outside. The humidity was terrible and I myself was wondering why the air felt so bad. When I came back inside, I started to feel loopy, winded, lightheaded and kinda felt sick as well. I even got a bad headache. This is not the first time it\u2019s happened. I seem to always have similar reactions whenever I\u2019m exposed to bad air quality. After freshening up and washing my face then relaxing for a bit, all symptoms seemed to subside. \n\nBut then the next morning, I had an extremely dry throat. This was a first and has never happened before. It wasn\u2019t a soar throat at first but it felt like sand paper, parched throat, like there\u2019s ashes in the bottom. Pretty much feels like there\u2019s some rough material that\u2019s stuck at the bottom of my throat. Each morning it got worse. Until it eventually felt like I had an actual soar throat. I was able to subside the feeling throughout the day with home remedies, throat spray, etc., but each morning it always comes back in FULL FORCE. This morning was the worst of all. I am now at the stage where I\u2019m constantly coughing and it\u2019s not really about the uncomfortable feeling of a soar throat anymore. I basically got no kind of sleep\u2026.at all. Not only is there an intense tickle in my throat or very frequent ones, but I am unable to basically relax my throat. It feels like my airways are closing in and every millisecond I\u2019m coughing. It feels like there\u2019s a lump of sand paper in my throat that\u2019s blocking my ability to breathe properly and as a result, I\u2019m coughing every minute, like my airways have been narrowed down to the max. \n\nAlongside this I\u2019ve been taking antibiotics prescribed by my GI doctor and its Metronidazole. I\u2019ve had an on/off chronic cough for a couple years now and it flares up the worst whenever I get sick. I will end up having an after cough up to 2 months after being sick. It is suspected that my chronic cough may be induced by gastrointestinal issues which is why I went to see a GI specialist a couple weeks back. The point of the antibiotics is just to remove any existing bacteria that may be in my stomach. \n\nIn this specific case though, I don\u2019t feel sick. I don\u2019t have a fever or any other common cold symptoms. I\u2019m just losing a lot of sleep over this BS. So I\u2019m not sure if me having this cough is a result of being sick from the air quality or something else.\n\nI\u2019m also a little afraid that it could be the way I\u2019m taking the antibiotics? I haven\u2019t taken antibiotics in years and forgot if there\u2019s any health consequences to not taking them the right way. Sometimes I miss some days I\u2019m supposed to take it but I try to make it up the minute I remember in the next couple of days. So when taking Metronidazole, there were some gaps in my consistency of taking it properly. And because my cough was getting so bad, my mom though giving me a shot of lime, honey and rum would kill it off because of the acidity. But I don\u2019t know if it was a bad idea to take a shot with alcohol in it since I\u2019m still taking the antibiotics.\n\nI really need some help on this, any clue as to what could be going on?",

I immediately told my wife to take the watermelon from me and she did. The seizing up did not go away and I felt like I needed to bend forward as if that would get it to stop spasming. I felt like I had the wind knocked out of me as it was hard to breath. I slowly got up and made my way to the passenger seat and was in a lot of pain. I have not been able to do much since getting home and can\u2019t get comfortable. Is this a thrown out upper back? A pulled muscle? Any opinions? I\u2019m 31 years old and 5\u20197\u201d",

She did have diabetes after the surgery but that has also resolved. Now, 3.5 years later, my mom is facing the prospect of a kidney transplant. Apparently the anti rejection drugs are very toxic and as such, her kidney function is severely compromised. She had 1 hospitalization in march 2022 for kidney failure (it was terrifying)which kept her in the hospital an entire month. \n\nIn the last 3 months she has lost 30 pounds and weighs 97lbs now, about 5\u20195. The stress levels for our family have been huge, so that is definitely playing a huge role. \n\n6 weeks ago she was told dialysis is imminent with kidney functioning levels at 18. \n\nShe met with her care team on Wednesday this week and they said her kidney function is up to 30 now and they aren\u2019t looking at dialysis on the same timeline. They were quite shocked at the recovery. \n\nShe\u2019s supposed to meet with a vascular surgeon anyways so they can assess her for a port, as they feel it is inevitable she will eventually need dialysis. \n\nMy mom is in discomfort all the time. Her headaches, the horrible leg cramps every night, bowel issues, all of it is so much to endure for 1 person, her medication is life sustaining but it\u2019s also slowly killing her. Her kidney issues make it difficult for her to eat because her diet is so restricted. I\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t want the kidney Transplant because life is already so difficult with transplanted lungs. I\u2019m hoping to be the one to donate a kidney if she will proceed. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1.  Is it unusual for her kidney function to go up and down so much? \n\n2. if the situation Becomes acute, can she get dialysis right away or will they try to do a transplant immediately? \n\n3. Will the kidney transplant be physically easier to recover from than the lung transplant? \n\nSorry if this post is scattered, things are very difficult right now. \n\nMy mom is the centre of my world\u2026thank you very much for taking the time to read this.

Sometimes a decrease in WBC can be due to medication use (i.e antibiotics, antihistamines, autoimmune drugs, antacids), poor nutrition, vitamin deficiency, viral illness or anemia.

I have been under severe unexplained circumstances for like 4 years now. \n\n**A quick historical background**\n\nI have always had a troubled childhood. A madman for a father who was almost wrestling with us all, most of the time. He was so violent domestically that I used to pray for his death, not gonna lie. Abandoned us when I was like 15. On top of that, when my mother could have been my go-to person, she always found ways to further ridicule me, torture me, and made me question my existence. I have 2 sisters and 3 brothers apart from me and the thing is, genetically all of them are more like my mom (fair-complexioned), and only I am the one genetically close to my dad (brown-complexioned). \n\nMaybe she saw my dad in me. I used to scrub my skin for hours and hurt myself just because my mom thought I didn\u2019t look as fair as others. To keep it short, it was a disastrous upbringing. My elder brothers used to hit me so bad when I was at max 8-10 and I don\u2019t claim to be Jesus, but what wrong could a 10-year-old possibly do? My mom used to hit me whenever she got the chance. \n\nTo keep it short, I have spent the first 18-20 years of my life worrying about things, being anxious all the time, in fight or flight mode, and questioning how I looked. In no way was I a failure as a kid. I was totally obedient, more than I should have been, ideally. I was exceedingly good at academics and got distinctions all my studying years. I was really good at sports. I won declamation contests in my childhood in my region with all that was happening around me. The only point I am trying to make here is that I was a very good child checking almost all the boxes.\n\n**The albuterol incident**\n\nNow I was never bothered much by whatever was happening around me until one day I had this huge huge overdose of Albuterol when I was trying to treat my asthma but filled the whole nebulizer chamber with the drug instead of mixing it up. So it must have been a stupidly high dose ranging up to 20 mg and that is a killer dose. Ideally, all the side effects should have vanished in around 5-6 hours. The effects included severe severe high BP, severe palpitations, severe heart pain, and vertigo and I felt like dying in short. \n\nHowever, the symptoms never actually went away. I started losing weight very quickly and went from 72 kg to 54 in a couple of months. Severe GERD came in, severe diarrhea, bloating, and a lot happening to my heart. I couldn\u2019t make sense of anything. I was having sleepless nights. Very rarely did I sleep those days. I started having blurry and kind of disturbed vision. \n\n**Situation now**\n\nTo this day, I have gone to several doctors including gastroentrologists and cardiologists and upon several visits nothing could be found out. \n\nThe cardiologists have cleared me on my ECGs, EKGs, cardiac ultrasound, CT angiography, 24-hour Holter monitor, Exercise Tolerance Test (though it said borderline positive for Ischemia). My blood sugar level tests, potassium level tests, thyroid level tests and even Renal Functions Tests have been examined but nothing was found.\n\nThe thing is, I have severe symptoms(which I will explain more later), which I seriously think are because of the Albuterol overdose becaue everything went downhill from there and I had nothing physically hurting me before that.   \n\nUpon my last visit to my cardiologist, he aslo consulted another general physician and they both told me that I was dealing with FIBROMYALGIA and that Albuterol event only played a trigger for everything that came in afterwards. \n\nI will start mentioning whatever symptoms I have and you people please help me find out if I really have it or not.\n\nFatigue: I have severe fatigue syndrome. I do not remember the last time I felt fresh. Probably 4 years ago. I am almost always severely drained out. I do not feel like doing things I once enjoyed. Not just I don\u2019t feel like doing them, I have zero energy to do them. It feels like I do not have an ounce of will to do things.\n\nHigh BP: My BP has been recorded touching 160/90 at multiple occurrences on different doctor\u2019s visits. Maybe some of it is due to the anxiety I have while visiting a doctor. But I know it for a fact that I am dealing with high BP. I have constant pressure in my head and sometime it feels like I will fall down due to eqarthquake-y feeling as BP seems to be touching high numbers.\n\nConstant headaches: Now the headaches might be due to high BP obviously but I have these constant headaches. Like something has been placed on my head for so so long.\n\nStiff muscles: My body always feels like its is imploding inwards. Everything feels so tight and not in rest. Like generally, it feels like tightening up. \n\nGeneral body pain: Apart from fatigue and everything, my body really hurts all over. I can never point out where the pain is but it just hurts. Especially my limbs (thighs even more)  hurt a lot. \n\nUnexplained dry, hardened and tingling lips: I drink a lot of water during the day but after the Albuterol incident, my lips are always dry and hard.\n\nSevere loss of libido: Before the incident, I did have a very high libido. Now I have zero. I'm not proud of it but it was very hard to control my libido and I've fapped 3, 4 times a day. But after the overdose, I hardly feel like doing it. Been months I felt the need to, tbh.\n\nNeedling in my limbs whenever I sit on ground for long: Whenever I rest my limbs under some pressure for some time, they start needling. Sometimes it's so bad that i can't stand. It's like my legs will sometimes go on a sleep and I won't be able to stand.\n\nChest pain and all cardiac symptoms: My chest at the left side hurts a lot. I have severe palpitations that I can feel all over my body. Like I can feel my heart in my legs and stomach. BP soares to unbearable numbers. \n\nGERD and stomach problems: The GERD was very bad a couple years ago and not that bad now. But I normally feel indigestion and never have a very good feeling after I eat.\n\nEarthquake-y feeling: My hunch is I feel it when I have BP rising high but whatever it is, it is horrifying. I feel vertigo and an earthquake-y feeling for several minutes multiple times a day. \n\nWeight loss: Although I have a good weight of around 67kgs (I am 5 feet 7) but I feel like losing my weight. I feel so weak at times that it seems like I am underweight by a margin. \n\nI have been dealing with all this shit for 4 years now and I have multiple times thought about ending it up once and for all. However, I somehow kept going I have no idea why. Please help me out a bit.",

I'm not sure whether this is related to my tension headaches, but the ear fullness I feel when doing this is the same as the symptom I outline.\n\n**Important Notes**\n\n1. I have very little stress. I really manage stress well. Beyond stress *caused by* this, it's not stress. I am retired. I have a great life. I meditate and exercise. No mental health issues. \n\n**My theories**\n\n1. TMJ\n   1. I don't *currently* clench my teeth while sleeping or awake. However, this did begin 3 months after a stressful period where I was clenching a lot. I wonder if this messed up a disc.\n      1. My bite jerks to one side at a certain point during mouth opening, which it didn't used to. **However, a TMJ specialist (regarded as one of the best in NYC and referred to me by my orthodontist, who thought my disc could be messed up) believed that this could not be caused by my disc.** \n      2. I do not have pain or visible TMJ issues on CT scan, so according to specialist, this is unlikely.\n2. UARS/OSA \n   1. I'm getting a CPAP machine to try because I'm desperate. But I don't think that it will help me very much. I don't really suffer from any fatigue. But who knows.\n   2. This was put forth as the main theory by the TMJ specialist after seeing my sleep study\n\n**My questions**\n\n1. Could I have a disc issue based on the above? I don't have pain in either TMJ at all, and the CT was normal, but I'm not sure this jerking motion is as \"normal\" as it was made out to be by the specialist. **Should I push for an MRI of that disc?**\n2. If this is related to UARS/OSA, **does that explain the chronic ear fullness?** This is a very distinct symptom that started exactly at the same time\n3. What else am I not thinking of? Is it really true that these headaches can just randomly appear and my best hope is trying random stuff?",

I went back to my primary care and diagnosed me with BV and PID following the IUD placement. I was carefully screened for STDs before placement and refrained from sex before the procedure. My infection was a result of my insertion procedure. I am extremely concerned about fertility issues in the future. I have done my own research from medical journals and found the data for infertility is found in populations with STD bacteria caused PID. Since the complication is rather rare, I\u2019m worried there is not enough data to really be sure if I will have fertility concerns in the future.

I was sleeping in my mom's bed- she never actually slept in it but rather on the couch in our living room. I was by myself in the room and she came to wake me up on a school morning to get up and I told her I couldn't get up. She was, of course, doubtful, and told me to get up again, and I reiterated I literally couldn't get up. My legs could not move, and if I tried to force stimulation to get my legs to move I'd have immense pain in my thighs that felt like I had the weight of a Boeing 747 on me. My upper body was fine and I felt no pain up top. I was taken to the hospital and they ran a bunch of blood tests on me- nothing. They found literally nothing wrong and I went home. By 1pm that day I could walk just fine. No problems. \n\nHere's my question- what happened to me?

Did I have a penis removed at birth?\nPrimary Concern: I have an unknown scar, and am paranoid if it is from a surgery shortly after my birth.\n\nAge: 18  \nSex: Female (?)  \nheight: 166cm (\\~5'6'')  \nweight: 48kg (106lbs)  \nrace: chinese\n\nI have a vertical scar that is a perfectly straight line from right below my bellybutton to my vaginal area (as far as I can tell). I think it would be classified as normotrophic? The scar's not raised or textured, but noticably darker and looks similar to when I get minor wounds and after they've completely closed up, but are still visible as temporary scars (lasting maybe a few months). \n\nI have had this scar for my whole life, have never had a surgery relating to anywhere on my torso or reproductive parts, and never sustained severe injuries in this region. My bellybutton has no irregular scarring or shaping, so I don't think it's a result of umbilical cord removal.\n\nHere's where the interesting stuff comes up. I was abandoned as an infant in China during the one-child policy. I have all the reproductive parts and functions of a female (breasts, periods, reproductive parts), and I am apathetic to my own gender expression. Because of this gender apathy, one time when I mentioned the mystery scar to my friend, they sarcastically said \"maybe you were a hermaphrodite and your chinese parents cut your penis off so that you'd get adopted.\" that sounds ridiculous, and I know that intersex people don't simply have both sets of genitalia (at least not fully functioning), but honestly in my mind it's not an impossibility, and I can't help but wonder if I am actually intersex, but my bio family or whoever was there for my birth, to remove any irregular genitals so that I would have a better chance at getting adopted. \n\nThere is a rumour that floats around the Chinese-Adoption sphere that sometimes abandoned children would have a strange and unique scar so that if need be in the future, the bio parents could identify their child. I've heard a lot of mixed things about the reality of this, but it is true that when I was adopted, I had a scar on my leg that looked like a messy burn scar from a metal brand. It stayed visible on me for the first 12 years of my life before eventually fading. In China, the orphanages usually house children with disabilities or birth defects more than any other demographic because \"normal\" babies are sent out for adoption (like what happened to me).\n\nMy current family doctor's earliest records of me are from when I started the immigration process, so the first year of my life has no medical record of what could have been done. It is also possible that my actual date of birth is incorrect since the orphanage assigned a predicted date when finding me abandoned. \n\nIn blood tests, I have the following irregularities:\n\n* elevated RBC\n* below average MCV\n* elevated triglycerides\n* extremely low ferritin\n\nMy doctor has diagnosed me with thalassemia, and other than that, I have no other official diagnosis or treatments. Is it actually possible that I was born interssex? If not, what could this scar be from?",

Turns out that all of my issues I had during pregnancy, the cause of my son\u2019s stillbirth, and my chest pain and dizziness were all a result of Rheumatic Heart Disease.\n\nI ended up having a stroke and I thought that would change my urgency of care, but still I was dismissed by all of my providers. My cardiologist was very condescending and said my issues, specifically worsening issues, such as extreme chest pain, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, feeling a cold fluid feeling in my chest, my swollen abdomen and feet, and a hard cough, were just the result of stress and anxiety. I asked for an updated echocardiogram since I had one last year and much has change with my symptoms. I was denied and said an echo was absolutely not needed in my case. \n\nI went to my primary care who was also condescending and said it was anxiety. At the point of anger and tears I told her I felt like I\u2019m dying and I needed help. She said she was not a cardiologist but if it would help me feel better she would order an echocardiogram at the local hospital. \n\nMonday I had the echo. Wednesday I was diagnosed with Rheumatic Heart Disease affecting both the mitral and tricuspid valves. There is still no urgency from my care team. I\u2019m being ignored by my PCP. My cardiologist gave a half-hearted \u201cwe\u2019ll request the echo records\u201d when I called them. I feel even worse. My chest pain now only ends when I feel a burst of fluid that feels like it fills my chest and neck. I\u2019m having trouble breathing all the time. But if I have a feeling if I traveled to the ER again, I\u2019d be dismissed right away just like I was before in pregnancy and earlier postpartum. I\u2019ve had this chest pain for months and especially when I was pregnant but for all the 6 times I went to Labor and Delivery I was discharged right away and never given an EKG or any cardiac work up. Same with my OB. \n\nSeparately, I\u2019m seeing a neurologist for my TIA. He\u2019s found something doing an EEG and multiple MRIs. He won\u2019t tell me the results until my follow up on 2 weeks but told me I absolutely cannot work or drive. \n\nI\u2019m truly at a loss of what to do. If I call the office I get attitude from both the nurses and receptionists. I can\u2019t even find good information on this disease because it seems like it\u2019s not common in developed countries. I live in the US, I\u2019m upper-middle class, I have always taken my full course of antibiotics when I\u2019ve had strep.

I treated my chronic back pain mostly with chiropractor and acupuncture, guided hypnosis sleep meditation...

After 24hrs induced and on magnesium I kept telling the nurses and Drs that magnesium was making me very sick, they kept saying it was normal and blaming preeclampsia, and it wasn't until I could barely speak and kept checking myself for stroke signs that they finally listened to me and cut the dose in half, I think it was 2mg to 1 mg but I don't know for sure, but it water being on it for 24 hours before dose was cut in half.

Immediately after birth I had a flash pulmonary adema, then had a latent post partem hemorrhage at about 13hrs PP once they got my breathing stabilized.\n\nWhat would cause me to have such bad magnesium toxicity and would magnesium toxicity cause a flash pulmonary adema?

I was sleeping in my mom's bed- she never actually slept in it but rather on the couch in our living room. I was by myself in the room and she came to wake me up on a school morning to get up and I told her I couldn't get up. She was, of course, doubtful, and told me to get up again, and I reiterated I literally couldn't get up. My legs could not move, and if I tried to force stimulation to get my legs to move I'd have immense pain in my thighs that felt like I had the weight of a Boeing 747 on me. My upper body was fine and I felt no pain up top. I was taken to the hospital and they ran a bunch of blood tests on me- nothing. They found literally nothing wrong and I went home. By 1pm that day I could walk just fine. No problems. \n\nHere's my question- what happened to me?

I went to the dentist and all they did was give my teeth a clean. This actually helped with the sensitivity. However, over the next two years, I recognized that every time I would wake up in the morning, my mouth was very sour still. During this same time, my mouth would also become quite sour immediately after eating (I'm talking minutes or sometimes seconds after even just eating a snack). \n\n  \nThe most alarming aspect of all of this though, was how I noticed that my teeth were seemingly eroding away: my canine teeth and premolars especially were getting increasingly shaper in angle (look more like a shark with how pointy they have become). Additionally, the spaces between my teeth are now much larger: before this period, it was slightly difficult to fit my dental floss between each tooth but now there is so much space so that there is no difficulty in fitting the floss between each tooth, highlighting the wear. \n\n  \nWith all this in mind, I was confident that I had acid reflux/GERD/GORD. I went to my dentist who was unsure if this actually was acid reflux but was more confident in this being bruxism (grinding). They made a night guard and told me to see if it gets worse. My erosion did get more noticeable and the sour taste was still there. \n\n  \nThus, I went to see a gastroenterologist who, over the course of a year, carried out a 24 hour pH test and then a 48 hour BRAVO pH test to see if I really did have acid reflux. These two tests showed that I likely did not have acid reflux. However, before these two tests, the gastroenterologist prescribed me with omeprazole (20mg, which didn't work for long before upping this up to 40mg). I have been on this 40mg dose ever since (just before bed as I normally wake up with a very sour taste and I have noticed that my teeth wear away the most over night), despite these negative GERD indications.\n\n  \nI also then went to see an oral specialist and told her my experience about how eating a Gaviscon antacid tablet is helpful in getting rid of the sour taste that I experience immediately after eating. They said if the Gaviscon helps, it probably is a stomach issue and that she cannot help with that. She then sent me to do some bloods which returned all normal except very low zinc levels, but I'm not sure if that's related.\n\n  \nNow, I am extremely anxious and confused about what I should do. I do think I have acid reflux because besides from the symptoms i've mentioned beforehand, the back of my throat does also feel more sensitive and irritable, especially with spicy food. There is no question that my teeth are not in good shape, and definitely not like how they were before this whole period of experiencing sourness began. \n\n  \nPlease, can someone give me a possible explanation for what has been happening and what I can do about this?  \n",
