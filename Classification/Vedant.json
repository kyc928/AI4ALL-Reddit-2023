Weed is illegal in my state, so I typically smoke the delta blend vapes but I will partake in occasional Marijuana and will rarely take hits off of someone's weed pen or take edibles to help me sleep. No history of chronic illness. I take some vitamins and melatonin. 3 months ago, I was diagnosed with adhd and was prescribed 15mg Adderall and the last month added on another 15mg quick release D-methamphetamine salt combo to try to balance out my days better. I have been sick and coughing for a month now, but during the time of my drug test, I had been sick for probably around a week and was taking over the counter cough/cold medicine. My doctor was a cool guy, and told me my prescription would get declined if I didn't submit a drug test within the month.  He was fine with me being positive for thc. I called on the 11th and scheduled it for the very next day. The next week I am called by my nurse and told I tested positive for methamphetamine (not the Adderall, like street meth) and Benzos. To say I was shocked was an understatement because I had done neither of those drugs. I was ignorant to the fact that the decongestants in my cough syrups can give me a false positive for meth. I honestly have no idea where the positive for benzos came from. Obviously, my doctor will no longer prescribe me any controlled medication, ever,  and I'm devastated. To say my quality of life has improved greatly after going on medication is an understatement. I have never done meth, and the last time I did a benzo was 4 years ago to see if it would help me sleep (mild insomnia). I don't like them. I understand the presence of benzos is more of a mystery for a drug subreddit, but I am wondering what my options for future care is. Would any doctor even touch me? I already struggle with communication and I'm ignorant to how the medical industry works. I asked my current doctor for referrals which they claim will take a little while and I'll have to go from there. Is there any way to advocate for myself better? They denied allowing me to retake the drug test. What questions should I ask a new doctor without sounding like a drug seeking piece of shit? Or should I just give up for a long time? I've been struggling with life for a long time so a few more years won't kill me but to say I feel stupid and cheated is an understatement. Feel free to offer suggestions on where the benzos came from. (I had only taken one hit off of someone's vape pen the previous week. No edibles. I had gone out to bars, but I didn't take anything from anyone that wasn't poured by the bartender). Thank you in advance for any advice.",

I got my wisdom teeth out just over a week ago and was going fine until last Saturday, where my wisdom tooth extraction sites were fine but the FRONT. It felt like my teeth were being ripped from my jaw. It hasn't gotten any better and I'll take Panadol around 9/10pm and 4 hours later will wake up in excruciating pain and have to take it again, and can't sleep for hours (such as last night when I woke up at 1:15 and fell asleep at 4 after taking it 9pm the night before). After about 3 hours the pain begins to come back and I can't last more than 4.5 before it begins feeling like it'll soon be unbearable again.\n\nI've been taking 2 capsules every 4 hours due to this pain, and while I was originally gonna be fine and stick to the 8 per day because night time, that's no longer the case.

I however am an anxious mf so advice and the level of danger I'm in would be much appreciated (it might be super low for all I know but better safe than sorry). If its relevant apart from when I got my teeth out I barely use Panadol like genuinely 4x a year, also I take Vyvanse and dexamphetamine for my ADHD which I resumed today as I went back to school (also its night where I am when I'm posting this incase that contributes anything?)\n\nThank you all!!!",

Thc edible usage is about 2 times a month to help me sleep off migraines. \n\nOn-and-off for about 4 years I have been having these strange full-body vertigo pulses. They happen when I am moving and still but seem to be aggravated by fast body and head movements. When I am having them, they will last for a few days up to a couple weeks. The intensity of the \"pulse\" can vary. \n\nThe \u201cpulses\u201d feel like a big, warm jolt through my body, though mostly in my torso and head and are only a second or two long but can happen in quick succession. Accompanying the pulses is the sensation of losing where my body is in space, a very brief disconnection from my vision and hearing, and the feeling of being very aware of my heartbeat, though my pulse is normal. Usually when I\u2019m having a flare-up anxiety is also very much present as the experience is disorienting, though I do my best to calm down. \n\nI have only had one or two instances of completely losing my balance completely. Usually, I am just a bit woozy and fairly nauseated. Also, my ears have had a perpetual feeling of fullness since this has started happening though I am unsure which came first. I also notice that along with my usual tinnitus I have had pulsatile tinnitus as well during flare-ups and moments where there is a defining ring and the world around me goes quiet. Usually this is in one ear, but can be in both and my hearing always returns to normal. \n\nA few months ago I talked to my primary care provider about these pulsing episodes. She prescribed a nasal spray steroid for the feeling of fullness in my ears, ondansetron for the nausea, Epley maneuver for vertigo, and ordered an MRI and MRA of the brain without contrast. No unusual findings popped up on the imaging and I haven\u2019t noticed a change in the frequency of the \u201cpulsing\u201d episodes after a month on the steroids. The Eply maneuver can help the vertigo. Curiously, she described the loss of sensation of my body in space as brief moments of out-of-body experiences/dissociation. \n\nFor some context I have chronic daily migraines that are about 50% controlled by Ajovy. Pain has lessened, though I still have the migraines daily. Occasionally I will take a half tablet of rizatriptan for the migraines.  also have generalized anxiety, depression, and ADHD and have been trying venlafaxine recently to help manage these conditions. I take vitamin D to prevent deficiency as I am prone to it. \n\nWhat do you think? Should I get a full dizziness evaluation or do some other course of action?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0",

Father died in 2013 of cancer, had very difficult years after in which I didn\u2019t grieve his death. Also had a very manipulative girlfriend from 2013 tot 2018. Been also having OCD since I were a kid.\n\nWhen that relationship ended I started to develop a cough and bowel issues. I saw that my stools were thin and weird. Saw my GP for both issues, but she assured me it would be nothing. Health anxiety started to get worse and I started getting panic attacks. Years passed and the symptoms didn\u2019t go away. Went to my GP so many times to get reassurance about my health..\n\nLast year in april I moved to a new place with my new girlfriend who is my fianc\u00e9e today! Around that time I felt a very hard immovable lump in my neck that freaked me out. Started worrying about cancer and convinced myself I had it. Went to my GP who referred me for an echo, but nothing weird. Could be an extra rib they said in the hospital. Anyhow, that lump freaked me out to the MAX and I developed an one sided headache at that time. It\u2019s more of like a head pressure around my right temple that sometimes radiates to the neck. It\u2019s literally always there from waking up to going to sleep. Doesn\u2019t wake me up tho. Developed (in my imagination) one sided weakness on the left side, which suddenly went away. The cough I had for years disappeared out of nothing but now I\u2019m left with this one sided head pressure that\u2019s constantly there for 14 months now. Also since a couple of months occasionally a weird smell. For some hours my smell gets distorted and then out of nothing (usually after sleeping) it resets. Bloods are perfect and did some neuro tests (reflexes, pupils etc) and everything is OK. GP doesn\u2019t see a need for an MRI because if it were a brain tumor she\u2019d likely see something in the tests and the symptoms would\u2019ve gotten waayy worse over the course of a year. Also still left with bowel issues. Never a solid stool, always gassy and stools smell bad. Thought I had blood in my stool but my GP said it was undigested foods. Also a constant pressure in my lower left abdomen. Don\u2019t know what to do now, doc says it\u2019s all because of high amounts of stress I put my body to.\n\nIs it really possible that I have this one sided constant pressure because of something psychomatic for so long? It didn\u2019t get worse over time. Also the bowel movements, could this really be stress for so many years? Doc also said bowel cancer usually gives anemia, which i don\u2019t have. Also have strong depersonalization issues for some years which worsened A LOT the last couple of weeks.. no one notices anything. \n\nI sometimes think I developed bowel cancer some years ago and last year it metastized to my brain and have it there also since. Is this something realistic or am I not being sober in this? Is my heavy derealization from a tumor or more likely the anxiety and trauma\u2019s. Last weeks everything feels very fake.\n\nSorry for my english btw, I\u2019m dutch.",

It\u2019s not an intense pain, but does vary in intensity. The only thing I can think of that could be the cause was once bending my penis down too far and feeling a little pop. This happened about eight years ago. Can\u2019t recall if I had the pain already before that event, or if the pain started after. \n\n\nI generally have full erections every morning and seem to have no problem getting one when aroused. My penis has a bend halfway going upwards, I\u2019d say about 40 degrees. When fully erect it points upwards, making it impossible to get it horizontal. As a result I am never fully erect during penetrative sex, which results in me never orgasming. This is mildly frustrating and anxiety inducing when meeting new people. \nWhen orgasming from masturbation, I often get pain in the shaft of my penis. This can last for a few hours. \nI experience no pain urinating and the frequency seems normal. \n\n\nI am a bit ashamed to visit a doctor, because it involves such an intimate thing.

Every night they'd get worse as the sun set. On New year's day I went to the ER terrified I was having a heart attack. That began a many months long journey through various doctors offices and specialist's clinics to find if anything was wrong. Here's the details:\n\nI'm 22, FTM trans man. I have trouble keeping consistent with my hormone therapy but my hormone levels have never changed dramatically from that. My heart never speeds up or slows down, I do get frequent skips (multiple a day) from various triggers like breathing a certain way or moving certain ways. It's mostly a near constant pounding. I can feel my heartbeat in my fingers and torso and head at all times, and it gets much worse as the day goes on. All tests done by doctors came back with only good healthy results (had a 2 week heart monitor, many months of blood pressure monitoring, multiple tests to make sure I hadn't had a heart attack, metabolism checks and other blood tests, and probably a couple more I don't remember. None of them showed anything abnormal. In fact, I am extremely healthy according to those tests.\n\nIn spite of that my heart still behaves this way. I have made significant efforts to be more hydrated, get exercise in, eat correctly, and it's not going anywhere. I was also treated and have recovered from an unrelated anxiety disorder that worsened my emotional response to my heart at the beginning of it all.\n\nOh, and the last thing is I have Tourette's syndrome, and one of my biggest tics is to take very deep breaths rather frequently. I've been doing this since I was 8, I take deep breaths every 10 seconds to every 10 minutes or so depending on various factors. I know it's the partial cause of the chest pain that also scared me into thinking I was having a heart attack many times, but I don't know if that breathing is somehow affecting my heart. My oxygen levels have always been perfect so I don't know.\n\nShould I be concerned? Is there something I'm missing? Is this just the way I am now?\n\nIt's pretty difficult to get to sleep because of this, since laying down makes it pound much louder. I worry my heart is working too hard.\n\nFeel free to ask further questions, I have a hard time explaining myself sometimes, and I will be more than happy to answer them in the comments.",

Ever since I\u2019ve been experiencing \u201cfreezes\u201d and difficulty processing. Waiting for neurologist appt.\nLast Tuesday, I had a filling done at the dentist and they gave me laughing gas the first time. It hit me pretty hard - I was given oxygen for 10 mins after and could still barely walk or talk. It took several hours for it to wear off.\nWednesday morning, I felt completely fine. Around 1pm, I suddenly felt really bad - extremely nauseous, hot, and faint. Starting writing a simple email and just could not make sense of any of my thoughts or even string a sentence together - very strange feeling of nothing making sense, like I was in a dream. Had real difficulty moving my hands on the keyboard and could not coordinate my fingers to even type properly. My head kept falling back involuntarily. I was going to tell my boss I felt bad, next thing I know I\u2019m sitting on the floor hyperventilating. According to my coworkers, I slammed my hands down on my desk and pushed myself backwards in my chair against the back of my cubicle, and was taking big loud gasping breaths as if I was choking. They helped me to the floor - I don\u2019t remember this. They called 911 because they thought I was having a seizure. I was on the floor for 20 mins hyperventilating - I was aware of others around me but could not shift my gaze from the corner of the ceiling. I also could not move or talk. Paramedics came and took vitals and everything was fine apart from elevated heart rate. Went to the ER, they took bloods, EKG and head CT and all came back clear. Dr said it could be seizure but unlikely, or just a bad reaction to the laughing gas. He referred me to a neurologist for more testing.\nBasically every day since, I\u2019ve had daily moments of \u201cfreezing\u201d which last 10-20 secs.

        "context": "Mysterious Stomach Pain\nI\u2019m 33/f with no diagnoses currently. I was a heavy smoker most my life until I quit a few years ago. I am a non-drinker. I have been on a daily medication of 12mg Suboxone for the last 10 years, no vitamins or OTC meds. \n\nI had a case of a really bad stomach ailment that lasted almost 2 years. Doctors kept brushing it off. It started October 2020 and lasted until January 2022 when it very suddenly went away completely. I went from 120 pounds to 83 pounds in that time. I gained back some and am at 100 pounds now. The stomach issue seems to have came back, and I am seeing a GI doctor next month but was hoping for some insight. \n\nDuring that time, I was in moderate pain daily and severe pain occasionally that would last days. The pain was localized to my stomach only. It would feel as if my stomach would suddenly start producing a ton of gas; and I would have to forcefully burp it up in order to get any relief.  It felt like my stomach was being blown up like a balloon, even having a high pain tolerance the pain would cause me chills. \n\nWhen it would start, I would press something against my stomach really hard, and half the time doing so for an hour would cause it to ease up. Laying on my back made it worse, I had to be on my side or stomach. \n\nOccasionally it would get so bad I would end up in the hospital. I had to go to the ER about 5 times in 2021 because of this. I would try the pressure against my stomach during these times, but the pain would just get worse and then a burning sensation would start. After awhile it would go on for so many hours that I would begin to get nauseous and begin vomiting. Once I would vomit, things would go downhill fast. These incidents would happen like clockwork lasting almost exactly 3 days. I would vomit every 15 minutes the first day, every 30 minutes the second day, every hour on the 3rd day until it would suddenly stop later that day. \n\nI would not be able to get out of bed, eat, or drink because it would immediately come up. Normally on the 3rd day I would go to the ER for fluids. They would shrug and say \u201cMight be the flu? Something you ate? Gastritis?\u201d I didn\u2019t have insurance at the time so couldn\u2019t follow up with a specialist. \n\nThe pain would happen whether I ate or didn\u2019t eat, but almost always worse if I did eat, which is what caused the weight loss. I began to fear eating. I had no diarrhea or constipation. Everything else was normal except the stomach. \n\nI kept a food diary, and came to the conclusion it was not specific foods causing it. \n\nMy family does have a history of GI problems. My grandma has Diverticulitis, Chrones, and IBS. My mother has Chrones and IBS. My fathers side has no GI issues. I myself have never had GI issues until 2020. Unfortunately the pain came back a week ago. \n\nThings to note: I normally feel fine in the morning and through the afternoon, pain from the gas suddenly coming on seems to happen towards the end of the day. I have also noticed it happens exactly 2 hours after I eat a meal. \n\nI thought I could rule out Chrones because I always assumed I would have bathroom issues if that were the case, until I read recently that it\u2019s possible to have it without those symptoms. I\u2019m really worried because I lost so much weight last time around and it affected my quality of life badly. I\u2019m really hoping to get some answers this time. Any thoughts?",

I got my period when I was around 13 and it was understandably light and irregular for a couple years, but stabilized around 16. I also got on birth control around this time, not sure if aging or BC was the cause. Pretty much ever since I\u2019ve had my period though, when I take my tampon out, the blood is only ever on the left side of it. Only on rare heavy days will it coat the right side. I always thought this was strange. Additionally, I have to tilt my tampons when I put them in, or it hits a wall and gets stuck/hurts and won\u2019t go in all the way. Again, I tend to have to tilt them to the left. My boyfriend says he\u2019s never noticed anything during sex, though. I was wondering if this means anything? I\u2019m curious if it\u2019s just a normal variation or if it means I have some form of uterine tilt or something. Thanks!",

I went to the airport,entered the plane. When the pilot announced takeoff, I suddenly couldn't breathe properly. I had travelled with plane 7-8 times, so this was a first to me. I lost control of myself and told the hostess that I wanted to get off the plane immediately. They first asked if there was a doctor among the passengers, luckily, there was one, unlucky for me, she couldn't help me. I grabbed my luggage and rushed outside the airport, but i was still gasping. Went to the train, still gasping. I was gasping the whole 1 hour ride. I didn't want to go home, asked my friend if I could stay over, she agreed. I was still gasping and at that point, it was fucking annoying. I stayed there for 3 days, had a panic attack on the second day of my visit, felt fucking ashamed that I was weak and troubled my friend. I left after that day, took a bus, still gasping. I was about to collapse on my way to home, but I told myself that if I make it to the house,it'll be okay. It wasn't okay at all. I realized that I can't even go outside anymore. I've been staying at home for 2 weeks now,and it feels fucking awful,like a new kind of low. I booked an appointment to the doctor, but any doctor in my country takes too long to get a in appointment, so the earliest I can go is August 10th. I can't afford going to a private hospital too,so the best I can do is ask here.Why does this happen?\n\nEDIT:Thanks for all the responses.I'll be going to the private hospital this wednesday.I'll be selling my guitar for the fees,but at this point I don't care as long as I can breathe normally again.I will keep you guys updated on wednesday.\n\nEDIT 2:For those who are telling me to immediately go to the hospital,if I could,I would.The nearest public hospital is a fucking joke,even the patients who's lying on the floor half-dead are ignored by the \"doctors\".Even if you get in,it's a merely 1 minute examine,since there's always a 1000 people in line.The private hospital costs around a minimum wage,which I don't have any at the moment.So in order to go,I have to wait for the buyer to buy my guitar at wednesday.Turkey is in a crisis right now,so you can't \"immediately\" go to a hospital unless you are way well off.Sorry for the blast off,it's only meant for the higher ups in this shithole.\n\nEdit 3:For those who are asking that I should ask my parents for money,yeah that is NOT an option.My father and I are not in touch for a really long time,and my mom is already in a lot of debt,and I can't work due to the obvious reason.That's why I am waiting for wednesday, to get my guitar sold.",

        "context": "Daytime Hallucinations\nI hope this is an okay place to ask this, and sorry if I'm just overreacting. I'm 24, male, I don't take any medications or drugs, and don't drink. I also have never been diagnosed with any serious illness. I have no history of drinking (only a couple times a few years ago), drugs, or any major medications.\n\nI have always had pretty vivid visual hallucinations when I wake up or am going to sleep, usually swarms of insects, random shapes or indiscernible things, and occasionally people. They tend to go off out of my vision then disappear, but I am almost always aware it's a hallucination. I talked to a doctor about this only once and he seemed surprised that I get them both waking up and going to sleep, he asked me to keep a record of this and come back but I never did and never went to see him again. I get these primarily when I wake up, probably 50% of the time, they are very common.\n\nRecently, within the last two weeks I have had two visual hallucinations while wide awake in the middle of my day. One was a man walking down the sidewalk while I was biking. While I sometimes think I see something out of the corner of my eye, this time I stared straight at him for a while and I thought nothing of it other than it being a strange place to walk. I glanced away for a moment and he was no longer there. I had another similar situation, both of these I'm certain were hallucinations, based on the situation there is no realistic alternative. The hallucination did not persist for more than 20 seconds either time. Now having looked it up I'm thinking this is something to be concerned about, I haven't cared much about my sleep-related hallucinations in the past since this seems at least not uncommon.\n\nSome more information:\n\nI am at the least stressful point of my last 4 years so I don't think this is causing it. I don't get delusions, I don't think I have any obvious mental illness and definitely not schizophrenia. The only thing I can think of is my sleep pattern. I have never as far as I can remember had a consistent sleep schedule for more than a week or two at a time, I am very commonly up the entire night and will go to sleep at any hour. When I have responsibilities during the day it often means I go a long while without sleep but usually ends up improving my sleep schedule. My job recently has enabled this quite a lot, although I am about to have a more consistent work schedule.\n\nIt feels like this issue is completely out of place for me when hallucinations are the only real problem I have. I'm worried this is an indication of something like Parkinson's. I'm hoping it won't happen again, but I am worried because it seems like even one occurrence of this is not normal even for people who get sleep-related hallucinations. I'm mainly just wondering if I am right to be concerned about this and if it's something urgent or not. I would rather not see a doctor, especially since it seems like most diseases this could be a sign of are incurable anyway and I don't want to take medications to treat hallucinations.\n\nAnyway, if anyone actually reads this I would appreciate any insights, thanks.",

I was prescribed meds and never took them because I refused to believe I needed them. Then that kind of resolved itself, or didn't bother me I guess and life went on.\n\nIn 2021 I was again diagnosed with depression and anxiety by a different doctor while I was in an unhealthy relationship - at that point I knew something was wrong because I was afraid to go to sleep due to the fear of waking up to a panic attack. I didn't take those meds either as my ex convinced me not to.\n\nSince 2017 I've had unfounded severe joint and muscle pain and stiffness. I have a rheumatologist keeping an eye on me but so far through numerous tests has found nothing wrong with me. A month ago I was at the point again where the depression was bad enough to make an appointment and this time I'm actually taking the meds. This time instead of normal depression, she said it's major depressive disorder. Prior to that my therapist had mentioned that she finds me to be severely depressed.\n\nWhen googling the difference I noticed one of the symptoms of MDD is unexplained illness. Is that was contributed to the diagnosis? Or is it because I've had these depressive bouts over and over for so many years? When this happens to me is it called a depressive episode? They don't happen randomly and I know the causes for why this has happened every time.",

The private hospital administered the first rabies shot at 5am and advised me to get the 2nd in 3 days. \n\nI am wondering whether I needed the rabies shot and the doctors at the first hospital were right in advising I come back when symptomatic, even though everything I\u2019ve read suggests that once you present symptoms there is nothing they can do. \n\nHow strict is the timeline for the second rabies shot. I am travelling to Kuala Lumpur on the 26th and I think I should be able to get a rabies shot there. Is it okay to get it at around 1am on the 28th. \n\nI am also extremely worried about infection and was wondering if anyone could offer any advice?",

For context at my work I work at a restaurant and we clean out these vent/hood filters every so often. Here's a link of what they look like:\n\n [link](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/14823/exhaust-hood-filters-and-accessories.html?filter=type:hood-filters). \n\nKeep in mind these things are somewhat heavy and hot/warm sometimes. Essentially what happened was that I had stacked around 3 of these things together and while trying to carry them over to the sink to clean them I underestimated how heavy they would be and nearly dropped them. I managed to recover from it however due to the fact that my fingers were holding the stacks in a rather awkward way (my left hand pointer finger was pressing against the edge/wall of one the filters which is this thin metal about a couple millimeters thick). It was pressing around right where the bend of the fingertip is on the right side where the lines on your skin are. When I had initially picked them up it hurt but I figured I could just quickly move them over to the sink and deposit them and then my finger would be fine. However due to me nearly dropping them I put alot more weight on that finger then if I were to just hold them and carry them across and my fingertip then just lost sensation completely. I quickly then dropped the filters into the sink and assessed my finger. There was no skin breakage (I was wearing latex gloves at the time) but it felt like the thin metal wall may have dug into my finger somewhat. Initially it felt to me like my finger had been lopped off because I completely lost sensation in it but the feeling started to slowly return after a couple of minutes, except for the side that got most of the weight. The aftermath is this red mark/line that kinda blends in with the skin lines on my fingertip.\n\n[Picture](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZePY3S8) \n\n It's still numb now (with the pins and needles/electric sensation if I touch the area near around it) and feels about the same as the first few hours after it recovered (no improvement). It's been about 12ish hours since the initial incident. Just not entirely sure what to do from now. Should I just wait longer to see if feeling returns to my fingertip? or should I go get it looked at?",

But yesterday afternoon (around 12:30pm) I noticed my upper left hamstring was red, tender and swollen around a small raised bump. It wasn\u2019t itchy at all, so I thought maybe it was a pimple. Within a few hours, I developed severe lower back pain, muscle aches and a mild fever. I noticed the red splotch on my leg had drastically increased in size and the whole area was raised and hot to the touch so I went to urgent care. After I arrived, I started to feel worse by the minute. My fever was rising, my back pain and body aches were increasing and it hurt my upper rib cage area to breathe. The doctor there gave me an IM pain medication injection, a dose of Benadryl and started me on antibiotics (cefalexin). He diagnosed me with cellulitis caused by an insect bite, outlined the infected area in marker and told me if it continues to spread overnight or if your fever worsens, go to the ER.\n\nAll night, my fever continued to rise (up to 102.7F) and my heart rate was high for many hours on end (120-140 bpm while I was just laying in my bed). Around 8am this morning I realized the infection had spread well outside of the outlined area, I had a headache and stiff neck, and I was starting to feel a little nauseas on top of my existing symptoms, so I went to the ER. At the ER, they gave me Tylenol and an IV for fluids, ran blood tests, and changed my antibiotic to clindamycin. All the doctors were able to conclude was that I had an infection caused by an insect bite, they had no insight as to what species. The general consensus is some kind of spider based on my symptoms, the appearance of the bite, and the fact that we have TONS of spiders on our property.\n\nFor several hours after I got back home, my fever continued to rise (just over 103F) and my symptoms were still severe. I have barely moved all day but have burned 4,700 calories (as of 11pm) from the fever and tachycardia. I\u2019m finally starting to feel a little better but would really like to know what species of spider bit me so I can watch out for them going forward. My family is especially concerned by the idea of venomous spiders in our house/yard because my 11-year-old sister is highly special needs, nonverbal and immunocompromised. \n\nThank you in advance!",

She was only really sick with rhinovirus, everything else was mild. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI took her to the gp on the 18th and he said to keep a log and referred me to a pediatrician. (I would just like to point out here in Australia its not common for a child to see a pediatrician unless there's a bigger problem. Its not routine for a child to have a pediatrician they see, they just go to a gp.) That appointment is coming up on the 2nd of Aug.   \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo far she has had a headache every single day since that appointment to varying degrees She doesn't need painkillers everyday. There's no pattern to the time of the day. Last night she started complaining of a headache around 7pm, so I gave her some paracetamol, at 8pm she was crying about the pain so I gave her some ibuprofen, at 8:45pm she was still in a lot of pain and I got her a wet face washer to place on her forehead, she eventually fell asleep but woke me at 6am with a headache again, I gave her some panadol and right before school at 8:30am I gave her some ibuprofen as she said it was still hurting, but she seemed ok. Due to all our recent illnesses they have had a lot of time off school so didn't want to keep her home unless it was necessary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt 10:30am the school rang me to collect her as she was complaining about her headache and couldn't concentrate on school work.  They asked if there was anything underway to sort out her headaches as her teacher has noticed how frequent they have become. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe has no balance issues, no other symptoms at the time of the headaches that she can articulate, she says the pain is in the same spot everytime, she points to her forehead and the top of her head. She can't describe the type of pain she's feeling just that it hurts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing that concerns me is that panadol and nurofen together do not seem to reduce the pain for her. Could it be migraines? What can they do for that for a child? Is there something else that should be on our radar to get checked? I do find the drs can be quite dismissive sometimes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/tSK61oN",

But yesterday afternoon (around 12:30pm) I noticed my upper left hamstring was red, tender and swollen around a small raised bump. It wasn\u2019t itchy at all, so I thought maybe it was a pimple. Within a few hours, I developed severe lower back pain, muscle aches and a mild fever. I noticed the red splotch on my leg had drastically increased in size and the whole area was raised and hot to the touch so I went to urgent care. After I arrived, I started to feel worse by the minute. My fever was rising, my back pain and body aches were increasing and it hurt my upper rib cage area to breathe. The doctor there gave me an IM pain medication injection, a dose of Benadryl and started me on antibiotics (cefalexin). He diagnosed me with cellulitis caused by an insect bite, outlined the infected area in marker and told me if it continues to spread overnight or if your fever worsens, go to the ER.\n\nAll night, my fever continued to rise (up to 102.7F) and my heart rate was high for many hours on end (120-140 bpm while I was just laying in my bed). Around 8am this morning I realized the infection had spread well outside of the outlined area, I had a headache and stiff neck, and I was starting to feel a little nauseas on top of my existing symptoms, so I went to the ER. At the ER, they gave me Tylenol and an IV for fluids, ran blood tests, and changed my antibiotic to clindamycin. All the doctors were able to conclude was that I had an infection caused by an insect bite, they had no insight as to what species. The general consensus is some kind of spider based on my symptoms, the appearance of the bite, and the fact that we have TONS of spiders on our property.\n\nFor several hours after I got back home, my fever continued to rise (just over 103F) and my symptoms were still severe. I have barely moved all day but have burned 4,700 calories (as of 11pm) from the fever and tachycardia. I\u2019m finally starting to feel a little better but would really like to know what species of spider bit me so I can watch out for them going forward. My family is especially concerned by the idea of venomous spiders in our house/yard because my 11-year-old sister is highly special needs, nonverbal and immunocompromised. \n\nThank you in advance!",

She was immediately taken to hospital, where she was admitted for 3 weeks. She become lil alright but during the stay she lost appetite, began taking random things and forgetting, lost the bowel control. She basically couldn\u2019t do any task on her own. After being released from hospital she did seemed improving little.\n\nFor a month she improved a lil but she became very much reserved and didn\u2019t liked to talk much but the bowel and  urinal control didn\u2019t improved. She could walk only with the support.When we contacted neuro doctor he said that\u2019s its Parkinson disease. The grandmother i had seen walking faster than girls of my age couldn\u2019t walk in front of eyes. I know old age is inevitable but why it had to happen so abruptly for her. This just tears me out, the lady could carried a 20kg load in front of me was now not in control.\n\nFew days later she developed some rashes which looked painful. Doctor said it\u2019s herpes and steroids needs to be stopped.2 days later she became completely unconscious. Couldn\u2019t even open her eyes. Again she was taken to the hospital. \n\nIt had been a week that her condition didn\u2019t improved although she does become conscious for 1-2 hours a day, but nothing significant improvement despite all the care she is being given in ICU. \n\nDoctor suspected fever is not stopping although herpes rashes have recovered almost. They said it might be some cancer. Her ultrasound revealed tumor in her uterus and also some kinda infection in lungs that might be cancer. Tumor sized 6mm * 6mm  in her uterus might be advanced stage of uterine cancer but they can\u2019t confirm as her body cant deal with biopsy.In 2017, she did had pain but the tumor was 1.5*1.5 her doctor said nothing to worry about.\n\nAfter suspected cancer it has been a week it breaks me within seeing her what\u2019s happening to her. I can see tears in her even she can\u2019t talk with me. Sometime she doesn\u2019t  say a word and sometimes she say unrecognisable words which i make her believe in can understand.It is such a shame i can\u2019t do anything. I tried to make her and was somewhat successful in doing that. But i am afraid these are her last days today her HB dropped to 7. I just can\u2019t imagine myself without her other than trips it is not a single day i havent talked with her.\n\nDoctors say they can\u2019t even  confirm if it\u2019s cancer and even if they confirm it is she has like 10% chance of recovery. It read a blog online on end stage of cancer, her condition truly matches with that. I really miss her i can\u2019t stay overnight with her in ICU, i just want her to be alright again and eat chocolates with me. I know we all are eventually going to day, but why in this way.\n\n\nHas anyone faced such a issue?\nIf there is some doctor in the sub can you please guide me a little in this case?\n\n\nTlDR: my 75 year old grandmother has a suspected stage 4/last stage cancer.

I feel it could be MS but no doctor could ever confirm. Been to many doctors and 4 neurologists over the years. Looking for suggestions as to if I should see a different type of doctor or if doctors might be overlooking something.\n\nI am adopted so I do not know my family history. Also want to note that two years ago I was 275 lbs and I am still having a lot of the below symptomsSymptoms (Bolded the most important)\n\n**Finger numbness** \\- Have had this since '09/10 and has gotten progressively worse. No pain but numbness. Had EMG done in 2015 and 2022, both the same results.\n\n**Penile Numbness** \\- This is a huge issue. Since around 2007/2008 my penis head and testicles have gotten progressively numb to the point I can barely feel it at this point. Can barely feel urination and ejaculation. Oddly enough sex drive has not take a hit one bit since I was teenager.\n\n**Erectile Dysfunction** \\- Have had this since 2008 has gotten slightly worse over the years. ED meds help.\n\n**Throat numbness** \\- Starting in fall of 2021 my throat has become numb. Hard to explain but I can't feel the vibration in my throat when I speak and when I swallow it feels different than it used to. No additional coughing or trouble speaking or eating (that I know of). I have had a swallow study and it came back fine as well as the ENT looking down my throat into my vocal cords.\n\nBurping / GERD - Had an endoscopy done in Feb 2022 and everything was normal and no cancer or tumor. Also saw nothing wrong with my vocal cords / throat.\n\nEars - low grade tinnitus\n\nEyes - loss of sensitivity. I could touch the white of my eyes and I wouldn't have a huge reaction to it. Optic nerve cup big but multiple opthamologists did MRIs and no glaucoma. Increased floater the last two years but have stabilized now I feel. No major vision loss.Tests:Blood work has been done countless times. All within range, no sign of diabetes. Testosterone maybe on the lower end but the doctor said not enough to give me testosterone therapy.\n\nBlood test was recently done for Neuromyelitis Optica. Came back negative.MRIs: brain (Jan 2022), cervical spine, thoracic spine, lumbar spine. Only thing found was a small demylenating lesion where the cervical spine meets the thoracic spine. This was found in Oct 2022. Doctor diagnosed it as transverse myelitis.I had a stress test two years ago and that came back normal.\n\n**My doctors do not seem to have an answer for me and it seems the symptoms get worse as the years go by. I am here to see if there is any suggestions that you can provide or maybe conditions that could be overlooked? Is there some other type of doctor that I should maybe be seeing?**",

I would like to try a half dose to see if I tolerate it better.\n\nI know the boilerplate suggestion is that \u201cno, you can\u2019t break it up because of the extended release mechanism\u201d but I\u2019m thinking as long as there is some way to distinguish the different types of beads within the capsule, I could roughly equally divide them into two smaller doses without messing up how the extended release is intended to work. \n\nAs far as I understand there are two types of beads inside, one type that dissolves instantly and another water-insoluble type that takes ~4hours to dissolve. As long as I separate the contents into two doses with proportional quantities of each type of bead in each, it should effectively create two half doses with the same intended release mechanism right? As long as the gel capsule doesn\u2019t play an integral role in the release mechanism (I don\u2019t have an extra capsule and would have to take one of the doses with only the beads), it should just be like taking a prescribed dose for half as much?\n\nI guess worst case scenario I get a lopsided dose with more immediate or more extended release but that dosage would still not exceed my current dose at any time.

Was a bit unusual the frequency and persistence of it though. It remained until the evening, but did go away with Tylenol.  The bite was red but looked fairly normal.\n\nToday, the bite has gotten larger and is beginning to blister.  This was taken at 3pm when it didn't look so bad:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/q93vkpg\n\nAnd then, around 9pm, it's begun forming 3 black dots in the center.  \nhttps://imgur.com/a/0A6vGfD\nIt's a bit hard to see, but they're definitely dark dark purple/black dots in the middle forming.  \n\nIn between 3 and 9, she was \"banging it around\" while cooking a hot dinner and she accidentally hit it against the doorframe too.  It hurts but she's moving it around feeling normal otherwise, no fever, no sick feeling, though her headache returned tonight at 10. But she's worried because it's getting worse quite quickly.  She's trying to ice it and has put hydrocortisone on it but neither seem to be making a big difference in color or size.  She does tend to react and swell like crazy over other kinds of big bites in general, but she's never had the blister form or the black dots in the center.\n\n She's wondering if she's needing to go in to be seen over this or if it's something she could ride out?  We live in California, near Nevada.  Does anyone know what can cause this?  She's concerned it might be a brown recluse spider.\n\nThanks!",

I\u2019m now mostly OK and have learnt to deal with it and most of the time I\u2019m either completely fine or it\u2019s very mild and I don\u2019t need any medication for it.  The only time it gets very intense is on a plane and the reason is because I randomly had a panic attack on a flight once and since then I hate flying. My doctor prescribed me diazepam to take when I fly and this was a miracle drug for me! I would usually take 4mg and it just made me so relaxed during the flight and I never had any side effects until last night\u2026 I took my normal dose 1.5h before the flight and it made my anxiety worse. I had to get off the flight last minute because I started feeling faint and like I was going to get sick. The fear was also very intense. This was quite a traumatic event for me because I was very embarrased about the whole thing and I was on my way to see my family so I\u2019m gutted I won\u2019t see them now. \nI\u2019m wondering if anyone knows if this could have been caused by a drug interaction? I also take 40mg of esomeprazole as I have quite bad stomach problems (functional dyspepsia). I used to take pantoprazole and then when I took valium the same day it seemed to work fine. So I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s the esomeprazole as that is the only thing that changed. I read that diazepam does not have any in interaction with pantoprazole but it does with esomeprazole although it says that if anything it should just cause stronger sedation. I also took an antihistamine yesterday 10mg cetirizine maybe that had some kind of effect? \nOne more other thing that I can think of is that i had quite a stressful few months at work and have not been sleeping that well plus I also had a keyhole surgery 1.5months ago to remove a cyst from my ovary. I have a felt a bit run down but other than that I can\u2019t think of anything. I\u2019m very worried now that the same thing might happen to me. I have to be able to fly as I live abroad but I can\u2019t do it without meds! I tried therapy as well but it wasn\u2019t really helping. I would be grateful for any advice",

My GP did say my ears are quite full of wax, or at least more-so than normal. Which can lead to a bit of hearing loss just due to the congestion. I can still breathe out my nose during the day, and am primarily a nose breather except for when i sleep as i get more congested at night, which then leads to me having awful sleep quality. \n\nFor context health wise, i eat rather healthy, 90% of my diet is whole foods, fish, beef mince, vegetables, with the odd processed snack here and there. I supplement the basics like zinc, vit-d, vit-c etc. and weight train often. I do consume a decent amount of dairy, although as organic as i can find, i have also heard this can effect sinusitis, please correct me if im wrong  \n\nI have no other real health issues im aware of, other than heart Premature Ventricular Contractions. I have been tested for thyroid issues and all seems good in the blood work, and all my other general blood tests have come back fine. \n\n1. I have been noticing a bit of hair-fall etc in period of having sinusitis, could this be a side effect to the horrible sleep quality Ive had for so long?

If there is a risk, is there a few ways to assist or negate the chances of anything happening.\n3. I have tried Nasal prescription sprays, and the stronger steroid tablets, combined with nasal washes. This provided some relief for about a week, until for some reason it no longer was effective. Why does it lose effectiveness in my case? For that week breathing felt unnaturally good, and my gym performance literally almost doubled in terms of how much i could lift and energy to do so, likely due to much better sleep. Is there any other techniques i could use to provide some relief like that in the meantime, or am i basically just strung out until i get surgery?\n4. Although Ive been dealing with this for a while now (I initially just thought it was all in my head), what actually causes this? I understand there is allergies, and inflammation but Ive never been allergic to anything. So what are the most common background causes for this, or can this just happen randomly to anyone? As i understand, its possible that i got sick once, and my sinus cavities may be too narrow for it to drain effectively, causing the reoccurring congestion?\n\nThank for reading the wall of text.

Normally she get 3-4 days rest between the flights, so in theory she should have enough time to rest. The thing is that she sleeps 12+ hours a day, even when she is awake she is just laying down, barely doing anything and watching tik tok and YouTube.\n\nNow I know that on your time off you'd want to do leisure stuff but it is a constant thing for the past 3 months we've been together. When I ask her she says she is tired. I haven't ruled out depression as it has been a think my whole family has gone through for various times in our lives (some diagnosed, some not but the symptoms were the same).\n\nMy question is, is there anything I can do to help with at least the physical part? Any good that might help her or anything to look out for?\n\nI just want her to be healthy and happy and not waste away (her words not mine). And no she won't go to a professional, she is terrified of the doctor, I tried many times to either suggest or help her in any way I can think of.\n\nIn the end she is an adult and will have to care for herself, I just want to help as much as I can in a non invasive way.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any ideas. Thanks!\n\nP.S. She is 23-24 and I am 27 if that helps in any way.\n\nEdit: For the smart bot, she is female and 24 years old.",

Ever since I\u2019ve been experiencing \u201cfreezes\u201d and difficulty processing. Waiting for neurologist appt.\nLast Tuesday, I had a filling done at the dentist and they gave me laughing gas the first time. It hit me pretty hard - I was given oxygen for 10 mins after and could still barely walk or talk. It took several hours for it to wear off.\nWednesday morning, I felt completely fine. Around 1pm, I suddenly felt really bad - extremely nauseous, hot, and faint. Starting writing a simple email and just could not make sense of any of my thoughts or even string a sentence together - very strange feeling of nothing making sense, like I was in a dream. Had real difficulty moving my hands on the keyboard and could not coordinate my fingers to even type properly. My head kept falling back involuntarily. I was going to tell my boss I felt bad, next thing I know I\u2019m sitting on the floor hyperventilating. According to my coworkers, I slammed my hands down on my desk and pushed myself backwards in my chair against the back of my cubicle, and was taking big loud gasping breaths as if I was choking. They helped me to the floor - I don\u2019t remember this. They called 911 because they thought I was having a seizure. I was on the floor for 20 mins hyperventilating - I was aware of others around me but could not shift my gaze from the corner of the ceiling. I also could not move or talk. Paramedics came and took vitals and everything was fine apart from elevated heart rate. Went to the ER, they took bloods, EKG and head CT and all came back clear. Dr said it could be seizure but unlikely, or just a bad reaction to the laughing gas. He referred me to a neurologist for more testing.\nBasically every day since, I\u2019ve had daily moments of \u201cfreezing\u201d which last 10-20 secs. One time I was eating a sandwich, talking to my husband and my body just froze up and I was unable to speak and just felt completely blank and frozen - unable to speak and shift my gaze. Another time we were walking through target and my legs got really weak and locked up, and I felt an \u201caura\u201d feeling, was unable to speak and just felt completely stuck and removed from reality. I\u2019ve also noticed difficulty processing people talking to me - I\u2019ve been having about 5 second \u201clags\u201d which isn\u2019t normal for me. \nAny idea what this could be?\nFYI no personal history of panic attacks or any anxiety, no family history of seizures, neurological issues etc.",

Caucasian, live in Australia.\n\nBeen unwell since December last year and had a lot of symptoms presumably unrelated to this. Gradually got better and recently had surgery to remove nasal polyps.\n\n2 weeks after the surgery and I was really noticing feeling clogged in the throat and tightness in the chest. Feels like I'm not getting a full breath of air when I breathe. No issues swallowing things down, although it is common to cough up a bit of stuff after eating a meal when clearing my throat (this isn't new). These symptoms aren't entirely foreign - I was experiencing chest tightness among many other things earlier this year and I have often had that feeling of something clogging up my throat (I always presumed it was postnasal drip caused by my polyps but am now thinking otherwise), but never so persistently. Of note, I definitely did feel a bit like this in the week leading up to my surgery (nowhere near as badly though), so I don't think it is a case of the surgery directly causing anything.\n\nI have been eating super healthily, eating considerably less, exercising daily for the last few weeks and have started on PPI's + antacids as prescribed by my doctor. He said to come back in a few weeks if nothing improves. I feel like my appetite is considerably diminished and I feel like the meds are minimising \"heartburn\" (I did experience a couple of cases of feeling like I wanted to vomit before going on the meds, so they definitely might be helping in that case). But I can't shake the \"stuck in my throat\" feeling. Tightness in the chest is largely always present, although never acute.\n\nExperiencing extreme difficulty sleeping, essentially only able to sleep when I am too tired to stay awake. Closing my eyes just makes my breathing issues extremely salient. I feel like symptoms do get worse after meals, but the throat symptoms especially never fully clear. It has also been a thing in the past where I struggle to sleep, jolting awake with a \"fluttery chest\" when approaching sleep. I wouldn't be surprised if this is directly correlated as I did notice this happening when I was experiencing chest tightness earlier in the year, but seemed to subside when the chest tightness did as well.\n\nI rarely drink and never smoke. Diet and exercise regime were admittedly poor in the preceding months, but living healthily for a few weeks hasn't had a demonstrable effect as of yet. Am doing nasal irrigation + steroid spray as part of my post-surgery treatment. Otherwise my medication is just PPI (one tablet a day) + antacid (2-3 times a day after meals).\n\nOnly other relevant thing I can think of is that I primarily breathe through my mouth as I have struggled to breathe through my nose.\n\nIs this likely just prolonged acid reflux or should I be more concerned? My doctor said an endoscopy would be a last resort, but reading up I feel like I should get booked in asap in case it is something more sinister (e.g. esophegal tumour).

i AM missing patches of hair on my legs and i have a geographic tongue(?) but i don\u2019t know how that would affect my mental state so severely. also, as i said before, i\u2019m overweight and eat a lot. i think i\u2019d be getting thinner if i had some severe deficiency.   \ni\u2019m starting to fear the worst. i can\u2019t remember so many things and i keep finding myself genuinely believing bizarre things. reality and fiction are very blurred together atm and it\u2019s extremely confusing and surreal. it\u2019s really hard to accurately describe how i\u2019m feeling because it\u2019s honestly just. unfathomable. everything feels like it has lost its structure and i\u2019m not sure where to even begin trying to put it back together.  \nif anyone knows ANYTHING at all that could be causing this, please tell me. i just want to know that i\u2019m not dying or something.   \ni started to feel worse about a year ago?? and then just in these past few weeks there has been a significant decline in my mental state + i\u2019ve been in a lot more pain and paranoia overall.   \nmy only clear health issues are a rotten tooth and astigmatism(?) in both my eyes. i have been exposed to black mold and fire smoke. i do not drink alcohol or take any drugs or medications aside from a ton of tylenol and tums  \nsorry if this post is hard to understand or just sounds like a rant/complaining. i\u2019m genuinely asking for advice \n\n&#x200B;\n\ni am 19, afab, 201 pounds, white and from the us, generally healthy before this (or at least i\u2019ve been told that by non-doctors lol) and my primary symptoms are severe confusion, disorientation, jumbled thoughts, delusions/false memories, weakness and tiredness.",

Insoles - two levels to try, neither covered under insurance. \n\nAnd a walking boot which we were told was the most aggressive option to tackle this, and covered by insurance thanks to the MRI, so we obviously went that route. \n\nThis doctor was so amazing and didn\u2019t make me feel like my several plus year long pain was being invalidated.

        "context": "How concerning/likely is serotonin syndrome when taking multiple serotonin-affecting medications?\nTLDR: is it okay to take all four of these medications together - amitriptyline, ondansetron, sumatriptan, and duloxetine? Given that all four increase your risk for serotonins syndrome. \n\nI (23F) have been in treatment for a concussion/PCS for the last two years with basically no improvement/change. My primary symptoms are headaches, migraines, muscle pain and sensitivity, twitches/tremors, nausea, dizziness, vertigo, light/noise/smell sensitivities, \u201csensation\u201d sensitivity (really sensitive to the temperature), a variety of sleep troubles, increased anxiety/depression, and so on. Pretty much all of the common PCS symptoms, and a few of the more rare ones. \n\nWe\u2019ve tried a variety of medication with little improvement and I\u2019ve tried every clinical treatment we can think of - PT, OMT, SP, Cranial Sacral Therapy, Mental Health Therapy, and so on. \n\nMy only other health issues are a few skin conditions (mild eczema, mild psoriasis, and HS), low vitamin D levels, and abnormal periods (very heavy and painful, and irregular - managed by taking oral BC). \n\n\nThe only medications I\u2019m currently taking unrelated to this post is meclizine, doxycycline, estrogen/progesterone BC, iron, vitamin d, vitamin b12, a probiotic, a daily women\u2019s supplement, melatonin (sometimes), and a few topicals for my skin conditions. \n\nI\u2019m currently taking a few medications which interact with serotonin and increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. But I\u2019m wondering if thats *actually* a concern, ya know? \n\nSo I\u2019ve been taking amitriptyline off label to aid with headaches and sleep. It doesn\u2019t affect my headaches at all but it does improve my quality of sleep a tiny bit, as I\u2019ve had what seems to be some type of sleep disorder (although hasn\u2019t been formally diagnosed) from the concussion. I\u2019m currently taking 25mg daily before bed, but we\u2019ve tried doses as high as 75mg before with no benefit. \n\nI also take ondansetron 4mg ODT as a PRN for nausea, and take it about 5-8 times a week. \n\nBoth of these increase Serotonin Syndrome but I wasn\u2019t too worried about it before since my amitriptyline is a relatively low dose and I\u2019m not taking ondansetron multiple times every day. \n\nBut two months ago my doctor also prescribed me Sumatriptan 25mg PRN to abort migraines when they first start. *My doctor did not tell me that this medication can also increase risk for serotonin syndrome.* But since I take it infrequently (1-6 times a month) I brushed it off. It\u2019s weird that he didn\u2019t talk to me about it but I chalked it up to my anxiety and forgot about it, giving him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThis week however he also prescribed me Duloxetine HCL 60mg off label to aid my muscles - I have daily pain in most muscles but especially in my neck and shoulders. They\u2019re very tense, spasm regularly, have extremely tender areas, twitch constantly, and so on. I\u2019ve tried OMT and PT for them and neither help. I\u2019ve also tried a muscle relaxer which didn\u2019t help. \n\nI was excited to give this Duloxetine a try because I really hope it gives me some relief. I have muscle pain everyday, always fairly severe, with the worst days being me literally crying and trying to avoid puking from the pain. I asked my doctor point specifically if Duloxetine interacts with any of my medicines, specifically the Amitriptyline given that both are antidepressants. He told me that they do not interact and the only side effect I should get from the Duloxetine is a sensitive stomach for a few days while my gut flora gets use to it. \n\nCome to find out it also increases my risk of serotonin syndrome. It also increases risk of intestinal bleeding. I take NSAIDs basically everyday unfortunately because of the PCS pains, so I feel like duloxetine making me more susceptible to stomach issues from NSAIDs should\u2019ve been discussed\u2026\n\nSo, am I being paranoid or is this a lot of risk factors? It seems like *a lot* to me. I appreciate that he\u2019s still trying to help me, to find something that will work, rather then give up. But serotonin syndrome can be so serious that I feel like he should\u2019ve at least talked to me about it. Given me a heads up or warning of what to look out for. Or allowed me to decide for myself if that is a risk I\u2019m willing to take, and if not help guide my care in some other direction. \n\nI have the bottle of duloxetine but I\u2019ve decided to not start taking it till I can talk to my doctor about serotonin syndrome. I\u2019ll leave a message for him tomorrow but it might be a day or two until he gets back to me, which is why I\u2019m putting the question here. And because I want an honest direct answer, not someone trying to save face or protect my feelings. \n\nI\u2019m particularly skeptical of this doctor\u2019s prescriptions because twice before he\u2019s prescribed me medications that have bad interactions without telling me. For my HS he prescribed me Doxycycline without telling me that it can affect my BC. If I had known that I wouldn\u2019t have agreed to try it. Staying Not-pregnant is far more important then the unlikely potential that doxy would slightly reduce my HS symptoms. I know it\u2019s rare for them to interact, but it should\u2019ve been discussed as I\u2019ve always been very direct with my care team that staying Not-pregnant is the absolute most important part of my care and Goal #1. And I recently found out that my niece was a whoopsie that came about when her mom mixed doxy and her BC soooo\u2026 it can\u2019t be that rare lol. \n\nAnother time he prescribed me a muscle relaxer to try and get my muscles to calm down without checking to see if it interacted with a medication I was taking at the time, which it did. When the head doctor person at his office caught the mistake she frantically called me to make sure I hadn\u2019t taken it yet...",

Waiting for neurologist appt.\nLast Tuesday, I had a filling done at the dentist and they gave me laughing gas the first time. It hit me pretty hard - I was given oxygen for 10 mins after and could still barely walk or talk. It took several hours for it to wear off.\nWednesday morning, I felt completely fine. Around 1pm, I suddenly felt really bad - extremely nauseous, hot, and faint. Starting writing a simple email and just could not make sense of any of my thoughts or even string a sentence together - very strange feeling of nothing making sense, like I was in a dream. Had real difficulty moving my hands on the keyboard and could not coordinate my fingers to even type properly. My head kept falling back involuntarily. I was going to tell my boss I felt bad, next thing I know I\u2019m sitting on the floor hyperventilating. According to my coworkers, I slammed my hands down on my desk and pushed myself backwards in my chair against the back of my cubicle, and was taking big loud gasping breaths as if I was choking. They helped me to the floor - I don\u2019t remember this. They called 911 because they thought I was having a seizure. I was on the floor for 20 mins hyperventilating - I was aware of others around me but could not shift my gaze from the corner of the ceiling. I also could not move or talk. Paramedics came and took vitals and everything was fine apart from elevated heart rate. Went to the ER, they took bloods, EKG and head CT and all came back clear. Dr said it could be seizure but unlikely, or just a bad reaction to the laughing gas. He referred me to a neurologist for more testing.\nBasically every day since, I\u2019ve had daily moments of \u201cfreezing\u201d which last 10-20 secs. One time I was eating a sandwich, talking to my husband and my body just froze up and I was unable to speak and just felt completely blank and frozen - unable to speak and shift my gaze. Another time we were walking through target and my legs got really weak and locked up, and I felt an \u201caura\u201d feeling, was unable to speak and just felt completely stuck and removed from reality.

I purchased crutches and a stabilization boot on my own and after 8 days was able to begin to painfully bear some weight with the support of the crutches and boot. \n\nIt\u2019s been a little over a year. \n\nI continue to have pain in the peroneal area though it\u2019s mostly a stiffness/tight/aching/pulling sensation now that occasionally feels like burning. Mostly it is exacerbated by distance walking, prolonged standing, use of stairs, and walking after sitting for a long period/first waking up.\n\nI recently had an MRI to check on the tendinopathy and the report says the MRI was clear. A friend who works in the OR took a look for me and said it appears I may have had an avulsion fracture, which seems consistent with what I\u2019ve felt and experienced. \n\nI also recently had an IME appointment with a worker\u2019s comp insurance doctor who agreed there had been a fracture and stated I need physical therapy. \n\nWould anyone be willing to take a look at these scans and let me know if they confirm or rule out a possible avulsion fracture? I tried asking my podiatrist but she refused to look at the scans. I\u2019m trying to get in with an orthopedist but it\u2019s a few months\u2019 wait. I noted a few question areas on the scans as suggested by my friend. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/jyLwHiJ\n\nI really appreciate any help anyone is willing to provide.",

But when I was 15 I took 47 coricidin cough and cold pills and was not breathing by the time EMS arrived. I was intubated for about three weeks and once I began being able to breathe on my own it was clear I was in some form of psychosis. I was ripping IV's out, biting nurses, running down the halls and a lot more crazy shit. My dad recorded some of these breakouts and its actually horrifying to see because for me it is all black. I don't remember any of it. I simply took the pills and woke up 2 months later in a mental hospital confused as shit. I believe I had dextromethorphan toxicity. Anyway fast forward 6 months and I had my first seizure. I have grand Mal seizures where I full on flop. They usually last about 2 minutes and my Husband (he saw my first seizure and pretty much every one since then) says that before I start full on seizing I become real quiet and look up to my left. After doing all of the tests (sleep test, EEG & MRI) my neurologist explain to me that there was a lesion in my brain with secretions firing off and if they fire off at the right time I have a seizure. Then more recently I had a newer MRI done where my neurologist said there was only a tiny possible lesion? I dont understand how it would get smaller? I still have seizures if I do not take my medication. I actually think I have more now because if I miss one dose Ill have a seizure, whereas as a teenager I was shit about taking my medications and did not have near as many seizures. \n\nSo my questions is could my lesion be shrinking and if so would my seizures stop?

My new doctor goes into freak out mode and says that I might have a urethral stricture so I offered to go again just so they would have the urine for the analysis but he denied it.

That's my only current med. \n\nAt that time she ordered an assortment of labs and they looked good. The only notable number was the 295 total cholesterol. High cholesterol but with good ratios runs in my family -- when I was a normal weight, my cholesterol was still in the low 200s. Other than my weight and the cholesterol, nothing else is wrong with me, but if I stay this weight, I'm concerned I'll develop other health problems.\n\nLike many obese people say, I hardly eat anything -- and despite the fact that many doctors don't seem to believe that it's true, it is quite true. I count and weigh and measure and track.\n\nBefore Mounjaro, I was losing about a half-pound a week on keto alone:\n\nmid Sept 2022 - early May 2023 (very strict low-calorie keto, careful tracking revealed about 1000 calories/day, no meds) 16 lb lost in 7 months: roughly half a pound a week.\n\nWith Mounjaro, I'm losing about a pound a week, for about 2.5 months (tracking reveals closer to 700-800 calories/day now):\n\nearly May 2023 - late July 2023 (Mounjaro) 12.8 lb lost in 11.5 weeks: roughly a pound a week.\n\nLeaving aside the issue of \"you need to eat more to be healthy\" (yes I agree, and I also need to lose about 90 more pounds to be healthy, so pick your poison, right? I can maybe maintain on 1200-ish calories, so \"eating more\" won't work), **my question is this:** \n\nEveryone I have heard of taking Mounjaro (whether T2D or not; obviously I'm not: my A1C was 5; my non-fasting blood sugar was 100) has had a bunch of labs done every 3 or 4 months. Some of the ones I remember mentioned are A1C, blood sugar, blood lipids, kidney function, liver enzymes, thyroid... I might not be remembering them all, but to hear people talk, it seems pretty standard and consistent?\n\nSince I'm coming up on three months, I asked my MD when I should go to have labs drawn and she said \"Your labs looked good in May \\[before beginning Mounjaro\\] so you don't need any.\"\n\nThat doesn't seem to match the experience of everyone else I've heard of? I feel OK but some people when they have their labs done after 3 or 4 months are surprised to discover their liver enzymes are through the roof, or their thyroid is way off. It's a newish drug, and it seems wise to be cautious with it. Are there some standard guidelines for this, and can someone help me find them, so I can share them with my doctor? Thanks.",

Experienced ankle inversion injury playing tennis approximately 3 weeks ago. Had an MRI done 1 week ago, the results show most of the anatomical parts of the ankle were intact or show basic signs of edema/sprain, but here is the result of interest: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. The anterior talofibular ligament is \\***torn from the fibular insertion\\*** with moderate adjacent edema.\n\n**Attending Physician's input:** \n\nThe orthopedic surgeon I followed up with confirmed the wording on the MRI report, a grade 3 rupture with the ligament being torn off of the bone (fibular insertion). \n\nHis recommendation was physical therapy, stating that it is possible for the ligament to heal on its own without surgery. \n\n**Questions/Concerns:** \n\nMy main concern is that I don't quite understand how it is possible for a complete rupture, where the ligament is no longer physically connected to the fibula, can somehow heal on its own to re-attach to the insertion point. \n\nI've seen a bit of literature/information on the internet that also says it's possible, but there are very few results that discuss this specific injury, and none of them actually give a mechanistic explanation of how a detached/completely ruptured ligament can heal to reattach to its insertion. I've seen some reference to a notion that 'if the ligament is not retracted after tearing off completely, then it can heal itself', but very few details beyond that. \n\nIs it actually possible for it to heal and reattach to its insertion without intervention, or will it 'heal' the edema and damage in the tissue but leave me without a structurally intact ATFL for the rest of my life? Most importantly, can anyone explain mechanistically how it would heal to that endpoint? \n\nIt doesn't make much sense to me as it stands. Using an ACL tear as an example, if someone has a complete ACL rupture it is virtually always treated with surgical intervention as they say it is not possible for the two disconnected ends of the ACL ligament to reattach themselves. This makes perfectly logical sense, as the problem is not just 'damage' to the tissue which can heal (even if imperfectly) but rather an actual structural deformity. If that's the case, how is it any different to this scenario where the ATFL is torn completely off the bone? Would it not require surgery to actually reattach it to its insertion?  \n\nI am not a doctor, but I have a background in healthcare and studied pre-med in college and am overall fairly medically literate as far as non-doctors go. I would like an explanation that goes beyond what a doctor would typically say to a patient/laymen. ",

This year my mental health deteriorated and I've had to spend alot of time with numerous mental health workers who individually had different opnions on medication and no one seems to be communicating with each other about it.  I was prescribed sertraline and told to stop my dose of 200mg lamotrigine so I did and that's where I'm convinced all of this has gone wrong.\n\nSince May I've had constant heart palpitations, I was telling them it feels like I've been injected with adrenaline, but this was just met with them rolling there eyes telling me it's just aniexty and to splash cold water on my face and breathe.  I then finally came off sertraline and was told to go back onto 100mg of lamotrigine after about 5 weeks of not being on it.  I was then put on an extra 125mg making that 250mg a day altogether over a week ago.\n\nFor over a week ive been experiencing severe dizziness and neasuea and racing heart.

For whatever reason, he did not do the blood test for a gluten allergy, but told me I was allergic to gluten. I began to maintain a gluten free diet, and my diarrhea and loose stools subsided. My stools remained rather thin, which always concerned me about colon cancer. \n\nIn late 2021 I accidentally ate very glutenous meals two days in a row, and had no symptoms whatsoever. I maintained a gluten free diet with very few incidents where gluten was eaten, then I decided to test it again and ate a lunch of a chicken sandwich with regular bread, and a spaghetti and meatballs dinner with regular pasta. I had no change to my bowel habits that I noticed after that, so I went to my new doctor about this and also the somewhat common thin stool.  He ordered a blood test in Q3 2022 and it was revealed I was not allergic to gluten. My new doctor at the time ordered an abdominal ultrasound, some other blood tests which I forgot what they were, and a HIDA scan. I completed the tests in early 2023 and it was revealed on my HIDA scan that i had an ejection fraction of -2%. I asked my doctor how it was negative and he didn\u2019t have an answer, just that it appeared my gallbladder was bad. He sent me to a gastrointestinal surgeon, presumably to have my gallbladder removed. \n\nThe gastro. Surgeon talked to me and asked me questions such as if I had pain in my right side. When I told him I had very little/very occasional pain, he immediately changed his tone regarding a gallbladder removal and explained that he usually doesn\u2019t have to remove someone\u2019s gallbladder that isn\u2019t experiencing pain. Immediately he ordered both and upper and lower scope (colonoscopy) which I have scheduled in a few weeks. \n\nI am 28, overweight since 2017, was fat as a child but in 2009 got extremely fit in freshman year of high school. Six foot two inches tall. In 2009 I lost about 50-60 pounds in only 2-3 months, potentially causing gallstones within my gallbladder. \n\nRecently I have been eating well and have lost about 20 lbs of body fat and gained some small amount of muscle mass. My current weight is 267 lbs. \n\nWhile many things regarding this concerns me,   What concerns me today/what prompted this post is The quickness in which some/many food seem to pass through my system at times. \n\nSaturday, I had chicken kebabs for dinner. (Chicken, onions, peppers) yesterday I had two homemade tacos with 90% lean beef as my main meal. This was 2pm yesterday. \n\nBy 7pm yesterday I was pooping some stool with diarrhea, but there was beef chunks in it. It smelled like the tacos I had just eaten earlier, there is a near zero chance it wasn\u2019t the tacos I had eaten a few hours earlier.\n\nToday I did not have to work so I slept in until 9am. I woke up pretty hungry, so I ate a serving of grapes. Maybe two. Two fists worth of grapes. That was my breakfast. Then, I went to the gym to lift weights. I came back, and upon arriving home I start to feel a small urge to use the restroom. When I do, a bunch of loose stool is there, but I notice what looks to be a white/clear thing in the stool. If you are easily disgusted, don\u2019t go on with this next part, but anyway, so I fish the thing out of my stool and confirm that it is one of the grapes skins that I had eaten just 4 hours earlier. I have not eaten grapes for at least a week, and I have 100% confirmed that this is a grape skin. \n\nWhy does this happen? I know there is a lot here, and it\u2019s pretty disorganized or unclear of what exactly I\u2019m asking I guess, but ANY input on this situation would be warranted. My friend who is a nurse says that she\u2019s never seen a negative ejection fraction on a HIDA scan and that is very weird, while both my doctor and my gastro. Surgeon seemed un-phased by this value. Again, literally any input is appreciated. Thanks. Also I will quickly add any detailed if you want anymore. Thanks again.",

Currently, I'm not suffering from any conditions, last year I just made a blood test out of curiosity for my health and the results turned out pretty normal except for my cholesterol which is in the normal range but closer to the ceiling. The doctor recommended me just to watch out what I eat but stated that I'm still young so nothing to worry about.\n\n  \nI have been drinking beer *almost* every night for the last 1 1/2 years. Typically five days a week, but there are some periods where it is a full seven days. I drink a can of 330 ml beer with 3-5% alcohol content usually, but there are *infrequent* times when it is two cans, but that is it.\n\n  \nMy question is, will this habit be dangerous? Of course, as much as possible we want to eliminate this habit, but given that it is there, would it cause immediate danger? I plan to slowly change this habit, probably a decrease in frequency, but as you know, it's a habit.",

Existing medical issues: range of GI issues and some type of autoimmune/connective tissue disease. No alcohol or substances. \n\nAround 2 months ago, I was carrying a dinner plate and felt something almost snap in my hand and had pretty severe pain immediately after. The pain has decreased in severity since then but has never gone away. The pain appears to be between my thumb and pointer finger towards the base of the hand by the wrist but not on my wrist. \n\nAbout a month ago (so 1 month after the pain began), I happened to be at my PCP and mentioned the hand pain. She felt my hand and noticed there appeared to be a lump in it and said it \"felt dislocated\" but said that it didn't make sense as to how my hand would be dislocated. She ordered an X-ray which I had done that day which was ruled to be completely normal. \n\nSince then, I still have pain. It's a 2-3/10 at rest and when in motion or using my hand, can go to a 4-5/10. There's some very minor swelling and still what feels like a lump. I also can't fully close my fist because my pointer finger doesn't lay flat when I make a fist which is in the area of the pain. No redness, numbness or tingling and it's not hot to the touch. Tylenol doesn't help. Ice and heat don't seem to make a difference although ice helps a bit in the moment. \n\nIt's just been a constant source of discomfort for two months and makes some activities hard because I'm right-handed. What could this be? How can I make the pain go away?",

I ended up Doordashing for 3 months or so. During that time, I noticed this pain on the left side of my body, notably right at the shoulder and going under my armpit and to the left of my left breast. I noticed that my posture wasn't great when I was driving, and I almost always used my left arm. It always seemed to happen when I was driving. I made efforts to sit up straighter and use my right arm instead. Both methods made the pain subside and sometimes go away completely. \n\nWhen I was finally able to quit driving all the time for work, the issue went away for a while. But now, it's back and it's starting to worry me. I have a doctors appointment on Monday. But I wanted to post here in the hopes of maybe getting some knowledgeable information until then.\n\nSome other information: it goes away when I lay down to sleep at night. When I wake up in the morning it's like it never happened, but as soon as I stand up it starts again. Straightening my posture helps, as well as keeping my hands and arms either at my sides like a superhero, or above my head. (think how people are arrested sometimes). No shortness of breath. No dizziness. No strange lumps. When I exercise (walk/run) it feels a lot better but when I stop it comes back again. Taking ibuprofen or Tylenol doesn't really seem to do anything. I'm also making an effort starting today to quit smoking marijuana (I smoke extracts with a dab rig) as it's just making me more anxious about the situation and I've been wanting to quit for awhile anyway. \n\nToday I bought an arm sling so I can keep my arm and shoulder as immobile as possible until my doctors appointment. Until then I'm trying to pretend I'm a soldier and keeping my back and chest as straight as possible. \n\nMore additional information: Back in October I suddenly developed multiple food allergies I never had before. Nothing major like shock inducing, but foods that otherwise wrecked my insides and made me sleepy all the time. These included potatoes, tomatoes, corn, wheat, garlic, Oranges, rice, soy, shelfish, walnuts, peanuts, and a few others I can't remember right now. Doctor thinks it could be related to long covid. I have since changed my diet drastically and these issues aren't as debilitating. I also started going on a long walk/run every day for the past 4 weeks. (haven't missed a day yet)",

She was immediately taken to hospital, where she was admitted for 3 weeks. She become lil alright but during the stay she lost appetite, began taking random things and forgetting, lost the bowel control. She basically couldn\u2019t do any task on her own. After being released from hospital she did seemed improving little.\n\nFor a month she improved a lil but she became very much reserved and didn\u2019t liked to talk much but the bowel and  urinal control didn\u2019t improved. She could walk only with the support.When we contacted neuro doctor he said that\u2019s its Parkinson disease. The grandmother i had seen walking faster than girls of my age couldn\u2019t walk in front of eyes. I know old age is inevitable but why it had to happen so abruptly for her. This just tears me out, the lady could carried a 20kg load in front of me was now not in control.\n\nFew days later she developed some rashes which looked painful. Doctor said it\u2019s herpes and steroids needs to be stopped.2 days later she became completely unconscious. Couldn\u2019t even open her eyes. Again she was taken to the hospital. \n\nIt had been a week that her condition didn\u2019t improved although she does become conscious for 1-2 hours a day, but nothing significant improvement despite all the care she is being given in ICU. \n\nDoctor suspected fever is not stopping although herpes rashes have recovered almost. They said it might be some cancer. Her ultrasound revealed tumor in her uterus and also some kinda infection in lungs that might be cancer. Tumor sized 6mm * 6mm  in her uterus might be advanced stage of uterine cancer but they can\u2019t confirm as her body cant deal with biopsy.In 2017, she did had pain but the tumor was 1.5*1.5 her doctor said nothing to worry about.\n\nAfter suspected cancer it has been a week it breaks me within seeing her what\u2019s happening to her. I can see tears in her even she can\u2019t talk with me. Sometime she doesn\u2019t  say a word and sometimes she say unrecognisable words which i make her believe in can understand.It is such a shame i can\u2019t do anything. I tried to make her and was somewhat successful in doing that. But i am afraid these are her last days today her HB dropped to 7. I just can\u2019t imagine myself without her other than trips it is not a single day i havent talked with her.\n\nDoctors say they can\u2019t even  confirm if it\u2019s cancer and even if they confirm it is she has like 10% chance of recovery. It read a blog online on end stage of cancer, her condition truly matches with that. I really miss her i can\u2019t stay overnight with her in ICU, i just want her to be alright again and eat chocolates with me. I know we all are eventually going to day, but why in this way.\n\n\nHas anyone faced such a issue?\nIf there is some doctor in the sub can you please guide me a little in this case?\n\n\nTlDR: my 75 year old grandmother has a suspected stage 4/last stage cancer. In 2017 her tumor size was 1.5*1.5cm (doctor said it is not cancer) and now doctor are saying it\u2019s cancer.",

GI looked at a photo and said maybe immune cells (didn\u2019t seem bothered)\n\n\nHas CMPI: I don\u2019t eat dairy/milk protein and she\u2019s fine, challenged (me eating, I.e. breastmilk exposure) twice and bloody stools came back so I feel decently certain of the CMPI diagnosis. Soy is fine for me to eat, we haven\u2019t tried soy for her on advice of allergist\n\nWe saw an allergist after the first round (avocado, oat, sweet potato, peanut attempt) and she diagnosed FPIES, and of course all those foods that we thought were safe (except peanuts) are high FPIES risk. Now we\u2019re decently freaked out after applesauce and pumpkin caused symptoms. We were in with GI a few months ago when trying to sort out CMPI but can\u2019t get in again until October and the virtual support is dismal. Our pediatrician is great but basically just defers to the specialists.\n\n\nAny ideas at all would be so appreciated:\n\nOther things that could be going on besides FPIES that we should ask our pediatrician to look into?\n\nOther super safe foods to try?\n\nAny connections between foods (e.g I went down a FODMAP rabbit hole) that we\u2019re not thinking about and could explain all this?\n\nAnything that could be causing this that we\u2019re missing?\n\nOther type of doctor we should try to get in with?\n\n\nI\u2019m a scientist so familiar with reading the literature, if there is anything you can throw my way that you don\u2019t have time to break down.\n\nWould love to answer any questions, tried to keep thing post short while including as much info as possible.",

Only daily medications are 10mg loratidine (claritin d), 5mg minoxidil, and daily vitamin pill.\n\nprimary complaint/issue: Over the past few weeks/months I've noticed that I've been sweating very easily. I've always kind of run warm in the past, but not to this extent. It takes virtually nothing to get my armpits sweating and soaking through my shirt, and not much more to get my face beading slightly. Sometimes even just sitting at my desk, or walking across the room is enough for me start feeling some beads of sweat form in my armpits. I haven't really changed anything in my routine, and I've been using the same deodorant I've been using for years.\n\nI finally established a primary physician about a year ago (since I had gotten lazy about it and going to the doctor during college) and he had me do a blood test/physical to establish a baseline and he said everything looked good at the time. \n\nI don't really know what could be different, I've tried changing the amount of deodorant I'm using (in case I've subconsciously been using less) but that hasn't changed anything. I don't exercise too much, but I do go to a climbing gym about once a week, and commute to my job 3 days a week (work from home at my desk the other 2 days). Also this amount of exercise has also been constant for a while too, so while I am still generally out of shape, I'm no more out of shape than I have been before. My diet hasn't really changed either.\n\nThe only thing that I can think of is that lately I have been thinking I might have some form of slight anxiety. I'm not too familiar with the symptoms so I was probably just gonna mention it to my doctor when I have my yearly checkup in a few months, but I just periodically feel an undercurrent of slight anxiousness. Again, nothing crazy, but I don't know if that could be related at all.\n\nI did also start taking minoxidil and a daily vitamin a few months back, after talking with a dermatologist for hair loss.\n\nBut yea, any idea of what it could be? It's been getting really annoying and uncomfortable having my armpits constantly sweaty, and just generally embarrassing easily having pit stains (I've been wearing a cover shirt/flannel to hide it easier, but this obviously makes it worse as I get even warmer).\n\nIs this something I should talk to my general doctor about, or is there a specific type of doctor I should talk to?

Like there is a lump there or something. I donno.  \nThere are no \"attacks\". It sometimes just hurts non-stop, sometimes it fades for a bit only to come raging back  \nIt feels like it is in the exact same spot, behind the flap at the back of my throat where my tonsil once was. I can stick my finger back there and touch the spot. It is deeply uncomfortable and pretty much always present to a varying degree  \nNothing I have tried offers any relief. I have been to many ETNs, I have had MRIs, CTs, CT with contrast, been scoped repeatedly. I'm going back to my ENT next week - and hoping he can look closer in the exact spot because I fear that the place where it hurts is tucked in and probably not easy to see via a nasal scope.  \nIt feels like a spot in the flaps of my \"palatopharyngeus\" or \"posterior tonsil pillar\" or \"palatoglossus\" area that hurts when It ouch it. Sometimes I have a weird taste back there as well. It sometimes hurts when inhaling air. At times it hurts when talking.  \nThe amitriptyline I am on seemed to help at first but I do not think it is actually helping, I think that might have been the placebo effect and that my ENT was just trying to pawn me off to neurology because she didn't know what else to do.  \nAnyone have any advice for me? I've been dealing with this for years, it deeply impacts my quality of life, and is a source of constant anxiety.  \nI should note I am a former smoker and I still vape nicotine. I am trying to stop that, but it does not seem to have an effect. I have stopped for periods of time before and the pain persisted during that time.  \nLast CT with contrast was in April when I went to the ER when it was especially bothering me in a desperate attempt to get a fresh set of eyes on it. They said the CT was clean, and told me to follow up with my ENT.  \nIf any docs on here have any ideas for what I should ask my ENT next week or any ideas for trees to bark up I would really appreciate it... because this just sucks :(  \nBest,  \nDaniel",

I am desperately seeking external advice after a long string of prescriptions and doctor's visits. Any help would be appreciated tremendously. \n\nBackground (a bit long and detailed, apologies in advance)\n\nI am 21f, Asian, 125lbs, with no history of any diseases/health conditions and fairly healthy. I was taking oral contraceptives initially but stopped after being prescribed my first round of antibiotics.\n\nFor the last two months, I've been suffering through numerous treatments for an ear infection I acquired in my right ear at the end of May. My first symptoms included a feeling of fullness in my ear to the point my hearing was impaired and gooey/watery discharge. I went to urgent care where they prescribed me amoxicillin for a middle ear infection.\n\nThe amoxicillin seemed to work and the symptoms abated, but after taking the last dose my symptoms quickly returned. I went to my GP on Jun. 6. To continue treatment for the middle ear infection, I was prescribed Z-Pak which I took for a 5 days. I was also given a referral to an ENT. Symptoms returned after the Z-pak, so I called my GP who prescribed me Levofloxacin. I stopped taking this after 2 days, because they made me incredibly nauseous. \n\nMy ear was feeling full again so I went to a different urgent care where they said I had an external ear infection instead and prescribed me TobraDex ear drops. I was using the drops when I went to see the ENT, and they did stop my symptoms. The ENT said my ear looked fine, so I left feeling my issue was resolved.\n\nA few days later my ear felt clogged again and luckily I could see the ENT right away. She said it seemed like a fungal infection so I used  clotrimazole and finally, everything seemed fixed. I had a final check-in with the ENT on July 12 where she gave me the okay.\n\nCurrent Situation \n\nOn July 20, I began to notice a slight pain when I pressed my intertragal notch or pulled my earlobe. Over the last few days this pain has gotten steadily worse. It is not really debilitatingly painful when left alone, but it is very uncomfortable and achy with the occasional stabbing pain. The side of my neck below my right ear feels stiff and I sometimes have a very low grade fever around 99.5-101 degrees. I also feel sensitive and get mild headaches.\n\nThis feels completely different from my previous infection where there was zero pain/itching, only a clogged sensation and discharge. Now, my ear feels dry, but it is painful to the touch. My guess is this is actually a bacterial external ear infection whereas it was fungal before? \n\nFor the last 2 days, I've been using my remaining TobraDex drops, but I haven't noticed any substantial improvements yet. I can't really go see a doctor right now because of extenuating circumstances. \n\nI tried taking some pictures of both ears and I am worried my right ear canal looks weird. Is this a normal swelling to be expected of an external ear infection or something else? \n\nI'm so tired of driving 45 minutes to see my ENT and taking all these antibiotics. Any suggestions are appreciated. \n\nOther Information \n- I am not a frequent swimmer and have not swam at least a year.\n- I have never had an ear infection prior to this.",

Naso-oropharynx related issues\nAge 33\n\nSex M\n\nHeight 6'5\n\nWeight 240\n\nRace White/Hispanic\n\nDuration of complaint 3~ weeks\n\nLocation South-eastern US\n\nAny existing relevant medical issues Hashimoto's thyroiditis \n\nCurrent medications NP Thyroid @ 60mg + 15mg\n\n\n\nI had a big boards exam earlier this month and about a week or two before it, I started to have some serious anxiety, coupled with negative thoughts on the potential outcome. I didn't think I would be prepared, and the boards exam is essential to my career.\n\nThe symptoms consisted of tightness in upper throat near naso/oropharynx borders, at times difficulty breathing, globulus or feeling of something stuck in my throat even though there wasn't anything. Dysphagia, sensation of post-nasal-drip with excessive salivation. I would try to clear the mucus or saliva from my mouth/throat, and swallow but I would have a hard time completing the swallow. Felt like I was trying to swallow nothing. Drinking and eating were mostly successful in completion.\n\nFast forward to now, I passed the exam back on the 13th so I assumed all my issues that I thought revolved around my stress and anxiety would resolve, but they haven't entirely. They have improved somewhat, however. I do not have trouble breathing from what I can recall post-exam, I also do not have much trouble swallowing. Globulus is still kind of there but it feels like it's a dry patch in the back of my throat. It moves around too, for example, the prime location appears to be on my right side where my tonsils would be if I still had tonsils. They were removed when I was a child. I noticed a canker sore develop in this area about a week ago. The white cap is gone but there's a little pink discoloration in that area. The sensation feels like my uvula is sticking to the back of my throat, or that I've basically become aware of my uvula's existence and it kinda feels like there's something sticking to it. Sticking a small flashlight into my mouth doesn't reveal any obvious abscesses, discoloration, blackening, or bruising, so I don't believe it to be a malignancy. I will say that with my mouth relaxed however, the right side \"arch\" to the throat that forms the M shape with the uvula in the middle seems to hang slightly lower than the left side, but I'm not sure if that's been the case forever or not.\n\nKind of at a weird impasse. I'm not sure if this is allergies, GERD as I do have symptoms of gerd (belching with regurgitation) which has been a thing for over a decade, if I'm still coming off the stress from this test or what. I had some feelings of nausea and almost like a gagging sensation to come on abruptly. As of right now, that dryness or globulus sensation is still kinda there but chewing gum seems to calm it down.\n\nI feel like the fact that the sensation moves around kinda rules out more of the serious potential issues and also that symptoms have greatly changed pre to post exam. I know cortisol takes a while to balance out once it's been circulated. There's no blood in my sputum or dark mucus color either.\n\nWhat's the general consensus? Anxiety induced illness, allergies? GERD/acid reflux caused irritation? Should I look for anything in particular to help shed more light on this?",

She's suffered from pterygium about 40 years ago and had it removed and has had minor eye irritations most of her life. Glaucoma took my grandmother's (my mom's mom) eyesight, so my mom has always been cautious regarding her eyesight.  \n\n\nAbout a month ago, my mom's right eye starting to sting/bother her, which was not uncommon after she cooked. However, the pain would typically relax and go away, but so far it hasn't stopped bothering her. The only differences now is that she's cooking more frequently, we have some of the bad air quality due to the Canadian wildfires, and we went to Mexico, where we had volcanic ash debris (literally) in the air due to a nearby active volcano. I will stress that I don't think any of the three things (cooking, wildfire air, volanic ash debris) are TOO severe, but I figured it's worth mentioning.  \n\n\nToday, she woke up with intense and constant eye pain/stinging. She needs to wear sunglasses to reduce her pain because light makes it worse. The exterior eyelid/skin is also painful, which made me consider a stye, but as someone who has had many styes, I don't see any red bumps yet.  \n\n\nMy mom has been using a warm compress and Fresh Liquigels. I just got Systene drops for her which seemed to have helped reduce some pain. Any thoughts on what it could be and how to further reduce my mom's pain? We have an optometrist appointment Friday, but I hate seeing her suffer.  \n\n\nThanks in advance.  \n\n\n&#x200B;",

The pain has now spread upwards in between my shoulder blades. \nThe treatment plan was for epidural injections but now that so much time has passed with me chasing down answers and begging to be taken seriously I'm wondering if I should even take that 50/50 chance and skip straight to searching for a surgery.\nI truly can not live like this any longer, I can barely get up out of bed in the morning. (I am/was a very active person, involved in sports and had many injuries. I am not sensitive when it comes to pain, but this constant and long lasting severe pain has completely taken me out of my normal life. I went from being someone who never medicated for any pains or injuries to someone who is constantly taking medication to stay afloat.\nPlease help! \nAny advice or experiences you've had let me know!!",

It has gradually been getting worse, more red and spreading. There are no doctors open in our area today.

She was immediately taken to hospital, where she was admitted for 3 weeks. She become lil alright but during the stay she lost appetite, began taking random things and forgetting, lost the bowel control. She basically couldn\u2019t do any task on her own. After being released from hospital she did seemed improving little.\n\nFor a month she improved a lil but she became very much reserved and didn\u2019t liked to talk much but the bowel and  urinal control didn\u2019t improved. She could walk only with the support.When we contacted neuro doctor he said that\u2019s its Parkinson disease. The grandmother i had seen walking faster than girls of my age couldn\u2019t walk in front of eyes. I know old age is inevitable but why it had to happen so abruptly for her. This just tears me out, the lady could carried a 20kg load in front of me was now not in control.\n\nFew days later she developed some rashes which looked painful. Doctor said it\u2019s herpes and steroids needs to be stopped.2 days later she became completely unconscious. Couldn\u2019t even open her eyes. Again she was taken to the hospital. \n\nIt had been a week that her condition didn\u2019t improved although she does become conscious for 1-2 hours a day, but nothing significant improvement despite all the care she is being given in ICU. \n\nDoctor suspected fever is not stopping although herpes rashes have recovered almost. They said it might be some cancer. Her ultrasound revealed tumor in her uterus and also some kinda infection in lungs that might be cancer. Tumor sized 6mm * 6mm  in her uterus might be advanced stage of uterine cancer but they can\u2019t confirm as her body cant deal with biopsy.In 2017, she did had pain but the tumor was 1.5*1.5 her doctor said nothing to worry about.\n\nAfter suspected cancer it has been a week it breaks me within seeing her what\u2019s happening to her. I can see tears in her even she can\u2019t talk with me. Sometime she doesn\u2019t  say a word and sometimes she say unrecognisable words which i make her believe in can understand.It is such a shame i can\u2019t do anything. I tried to make her and was somewhat successful in doing that. But i am afraid these are her last days today her HB dropped to 7. I just can\u2019t imagine myself without her other than trips it is not a single day i havent talked with her.\n\nDoctors say they can\u2019t even  confirm if it\u2019s cancer and even if they confirm it is she has like 10% chance of recovery. It read a blog online on end stage of cancer, her condition truly matches with that. I really miss her i can\u2019t stay overnight with her in ICU, i just want her to be alright again and eat chocolates with me. I know we all are eventually going to day, but why in this way.\n\n\nHas anyone faced such a issue?\nIf there is some doctor in the sub can you please guide me a little in this case?\n\n\nTlDR: my 75 year old grandmother has a suspected stage 4/last stage cancer. In 2017 her tumor size was 1.5*1.5cm (doctor said it is not cancer) and now doctor are saying it\u2019s cancer.",

Now I developed it in my RIGHT hip and it\u2019s recently spread to my back - not as severe as how my leg was from jan to ending of may I could barely walk without a lot of pain and walking slow now I can walk but the constant stiffness feeling is there and I can\u2019t walk as much as I used to (I was very active). If I lay my leg down on a particular side it feels heavy - same with my hip. I\u2019ve been trying to put it down to stress even though I\u2019m starting to feel like it\u2019s not possible but tbh I was VERY stress and anxious (would book a doctor appointment every week at that point). And I took a break from university and working but all from home (big change for someone who was always active)!so there\u2019s a pretty big life change - I know it probably has nothing to do with this but I\u2019m just trying to make sense of why I think I\u2019m dying or something. There\u2019s also been a lot of twitching/pulsing. At one point my feet were going red and warm every night and my little toe was red all the time, this has reduced a lot my feet don\u2019t often go red and warm anymore which is good bc it made me so anxious - they could\u2019ve been related to chilblains.\n\nNow with it kinda being in my back, it doesn\u2019t feel painful more so annoying - however, when I lay down it feels like I\u2019m being squeezed slightly / nauseous. When I sit up this feeling disappears but currently I\u2019m finding it so hard to sleep as I just wanna lay down. I\u2019m start to lose a lot of hope. This is ofc pushing me into a deeper depression. I guess what I\u2019m asking is shall I go back to my doctor?is this the first sign of something terrible\u2026 am I dying lol?",

Like self therapy where I work through things myself. I've always kind of done that. Like when people take mushrooms to work through their shit. I was using ketamine kinda too but because of my medication it just makes me feel icky so I don't do it anymore.\n\nJuly 2nd I went into the ER for a Pulmonary Embolism. I fractured my leg when I was hit by a car back in 2015 and I guess I was supposed to take blood thinners from then on because being bed ridden I ended up with a TON of blood clots in that leg. I was in my 20s and not living a normal life and honestly I forgot. So I'm predisposed to clots. I'm anemic, I have low count of enlarged RBCs as well. Fast forward May 17th I tear off the tendon in my great toe and have it screwed back on. Bed rest again, didn't move around, and so I ended up with the DVT and PE. \n\nMy BP was like 136/128 when I went into the ER. I have a low BP normally, it was like 96/47 or something like that when I went to my PCP which is average. My BP and heart rate stayed pretty high while in the ER, like 130-155/100-115 and heart rate of 120+ every time I got up to walk to the bathroom. the drs said it could have been white coat syndrome though. I bought a blood pressure monitor but haven't been testing it. I feel kinda stressed and like my BP is high lately but haven't been checking it. I'm assuming it is just my normal anxiety or malnutrition.\n\nI was told to follow up with my PCP after the ER to get referred to a Hematologist. I did a week after the ER. At that point I was feeling pretty good?. I get sick and hurt often but I feel like I heal pretty fast. Probably because I am stubborn and don't like being sick or hurt or crippled for long. I hate pain killers, so I try to not be in pain.\n\nI finally got a call for the referral on Friday. I missed the call, called back Saturday, was told they would call back Monday. I was waiting for a referral letter and actually got it today, haven't gone to grab it out of the mailbox yet though. Anyways, it was an Oncology office that called me and I have an appointment on the 1st. Now I asked the secretary or whoever called me why I was referred to an Oncology office when I asked my DR for a hematologist, like if she knew. I've been worried all weekend understandably. She said they have both hematologists and oncologists and I was seeing a hematologist, but idk if she could honestly tell me on the phone, if she knew, but her voice sounded....worried?\n\nSaturday night I've been marathoning the show House and learned Oncology is a cancer dr. So I went back and looked at my blood test results from the ER and have been trying to research. I'm not a DR so I don't really understand the things I've found. \n\nHere is one article, and it scares me\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23674436/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23674436/)\n\nHere are some of my blood test results that were flagged\n\nWhen I was admitted to the ER my WBC count was 20.3k/UL. from my understanding 11k/UL is high. From what I have read there is a 12% chance of elevated WBC in Pulmonary Embolism patients. and that can increase the chance of a PE again, or them accidentally finding cancer. I am at risk for cervical cancer as well and haven't gotten my second test to check again. I should do that soon....\n\nMy HGB 15.9g/dL\n\nNeutrophils 17.4k/UL\n\nMonocytes 1.1k/UL\n\nBUN <7mg/DL but I do have a crappy diet and I'm mostly vegan and don't eat much protein anyways\n\nAST 11U/L\n\nIdk which ones matter for this question tho\n\nThere are quite a few other things that are pretty close to the low end, and others close to the high end, but not over/under. I can give you those numbers, they took my blood like 30x while I was there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll admit I am pretty lazy and lay around 95% of the day but I move my legs often and get up and try to stretch because the PE was the most painful scary experience I've had in my life and I do not want it to happen again.  I try to eat well now, I drink ensures for the vitamins and protein. I drink a good amount of water and crystal light drinks. I'm just I'm getting tired again, I sleep like 15 hrs a day lately, and like winded? I ate a good amount of food and tried to go grocery shopping yesterday and I had to hold the shelves and walked slowly so I wouldn't pass out. People were staring at me. \n\nI've also lost 40lbs since May10th after breaking up with an abusive ex. I gained that 40lbs during our 4 years together and never really lost more than 10lbs for a month or so before gaining it back. I was drinking a fifth of vodka a day for months and smoking pot before the breakup, but have quit cold turkey literally the day I moved out. So i thought maybe my weight was due to pigging out from smoking weed and the high calories in alcohol. and being lazy.\n\nLast week I wasn't feeling too hot, and I lost 8lbs. Since then I have been force feeding myself with high calorie foods, and like hummus and stuff and I gained back 6lbs but have only had one BM.\n\nSorry if this is rambling. I just want to know if I am worrying over nothing. \n\nI guess I'm asking...was my high WBC just that 12% chance thing, or should I be worried? I know worrying doesn't help. I've had slightly elevated WBC counts in blood tests in the past. But not enough for them to worry?\n\nSome cancers run in my family. I think Lymphoma. I don't want to ask my mom though, I don't want them to worry, they are extremely sick and bed ridden, they don't need the stress. \n\nThank you\n\n ",

It was acting normally, I think, just got scared when someone put it on me and so it dug its claws into my arm. This is in Poland. I assume the cat has no vaccinations. I don't have the contact info for the family, so no ability to check on the cat. The scratches have healed at this point and I feel normal, just horribly anxious. I have pretty bad health anxiety in general. Do I have anything to be worried about, do I need to do anything? Thank you.",

After being at the hospital for over 8 hours contractions start to get more rapid and the woman became fully dilated. She attempted to deliver the baby naturally but to no avail.

Her vital signs started to drastically lower with he heart rate being dangerously low. The doctors started administering blood infusions to stabilize the woman. The obstetrician later determined an additional surgery was necessary at 9 am after two CT scans were done that revealed abdominal bleeding. This was 7 hours post initial c section. The uterus was ruptured and unable to be repaired and hysterectomy was the only avenue deemed necessary to save the mothers life. Has anyone experienced this? Could the hysterectomy be prevented by doing a uterus repair if surgery was done sooner? Does this seem to be a good legal case of medical malpractice/negligence? Any thoughts or recommendations?",

I recently had what appeared an ingrown hair starting to form on the base of my penis shaft. After a couple of days, the bump resembled a pimple and I popped it leading me to an urgent care visit to ensure everything was okay and rule out possible sti exposure. The doctor prescribed me an antibiotic to control infection for 10 days, which I took through yesterday. I was also tested for trich/ghon/chla and tested negative for all. \n\nA few days after the doctor, I did notice a hair growing under the skin of the irritated area and was able to easily remove most of the hair without digging into my skin. Afterwards I kept taking the antibiotic and the skin is no longer raised however I do appear to have a small lesion where the skin looks to still be healing. \n\nFast forward to yesterday, I noticed the skin still healing and decided to try applying some cortisone cream and a band aid to promote the healing.. I woke up this morning and the area seems to be worse, visibly more red and it appears another hair growing out appears to be red and also appearing as a lesion..\n\nI am slightly paranoid but just wondering if I should get a second opinion on this being related to an sti or if this looks like a continuation of irritated skin due to my hair?

I don't remember any of it. I simply took the pills and woke up 2 months later in a mental hospital confused as shit. I believe I had dextromethorphan toxicity. Anyway fast forward 6 months and I had my first seizure. I have grand Mal seizures where I full on flop. They usually last about 2 minutes and my Husband (he saw my first seizure and pretty much every one since then) says that before I start full on seizing I become real quiet and look up to my left. After doing all of the tests (sleep test, EEG & MRI) my neurologist explain to me that there was a lesion in my brain with secretions firing off and if they fire off at the right time I have a seizure. Then more recently I had a newer MRI done where my neurologist said there was only a tiny possible lesion? I dont understand how it would get smaller? I still have seizures if I do not take my medication. I actually think I have more now because if I miss one dose Ill have a seizure, whereas as a teenager I was shit about taking my medications and did not have near as many seizures. \n\nSo my questions is could my lesion be shrinking and if so would my seizures stop?

Non-smoker, frequent social drinker but not problematically so, semi-frequent cbd/thc user to unwind. No current prescriptions or notable prescription history. Born with very deviated septum that has never been operated on and has not been formally assessed since early childhood. No known medical conditions. Did have appendectomy 20 years ago and had surgery on his heart as an infant (reason and cause unknown to me, sorry). \n\nAs the title suggests, I\u2019m looking to get some info as to what the next steps should be in order to address my partner\u2019s horrible sleep apnea caused by a deviated septum he has had since birth. \n\nHe, unfortunately, didn\u2019t grow up with consistent medical insurance. His septum has never been corrected, but it was evaluated and identified as being deviated by a doctor at some point in his childhood. \n\nHe has extremely limited use of his right nostril, arguably no use at all. This has created a level of snoring that is comically and shockingly aggressive\u2014 like, shakes the wall level of timbre. He warned me about the snoring when we first started seeing each other years ago, but nothing could have prepared me for the sounds that came out of that man the first time he and I shared the night. I\u2019m a very heavy sleeper and, once I\u2019m out, his snoring won\u2019t wake me up. However, it\u2019s quite hard actually falling asleep some nights because the moments he stops breathing and is unable to inhale (his chest rises and he is clearly trying to breathe, but it becomes obstructed) makes me very nervous as I feel responsible for making sure he resumes normal breathing. Usually, I\u2019m able to jostle him slightly and he\u2019s able to resume. I know it will likely resolve without intervention since it, presumably, occurs repeatedly while I\u2019m asleep and, for quite some time this has resolved a lot of my anxiety. \n\nUnfortunately, a close friend of my sister\u2019s died very suddenly of a sleep apnea-induced brain aneurysm at the age of 35 earlier this year. While this newfound fear hasn\u2019t greatly affected my sleep, it does make me very scared. He is in his early thirties and, as is common for men of that age, he is acutely aware of and frightened by aging\u2014 I think the thought of wearing a CPAP reinforces that awareness and fear. \n\nHowever, he has very extensive and stable insurance through the company he\u2019s worked for for the past 15 years and has been made aware that corrective surgery for his septum might be covered by insurance as well as potentially fix this issue. FWIW, his sleep apnea has been destructive to his life in ways more tangible than the idea that he could die in his sleep. It has clearly impacted the quality of his sleep for many years, to the point that, if he is stationary (seated or laying down) without active stimulation, he will be completely and deeply asleep within 30 seconds. It\u2019s actually remarkable to see, as someone who has a reasonably hard time falling asleep. \n\nHe has agreed to pursue medical help for the issue. My question is what the first step looks like and how we should proceed. Should he schedule a consultation with an ENT? Or a GP (we moved under a year ago and I don\u2019t believe he has one here)?\n\n(For the sake of clarity, he is very financially stable and capable of paying for what might not be covered by insurance. If he has no choice but to use a CPAP, he\u2019s going to have to get over it. Rather he feel \u201cold\u201d than be dead before 50). \n\nThank you all in advance. This has been weighing on me.

I am reaching out to the community for some information and guidance regarding the physical symptoms I have been experiencing, which have been progressively impacting my life for the worse. I've tried to keep these symptoms hidden for some time, but recently they have become unbearable, leading to extreme health issues.\n\nI have been dealing with anxiety for nearly a decade. In the early years, I considered it a normal sensation that would pass after a few seconds. However, as time went on, the duration and intensity of my anxiety increased significantly. It became associated with certain physical attributes, such as heights or open spaces, leading me to avoid such situations. Over the years, my brain has linked anxiety to many variables, causing me to restrict various activities to avoid triggering anxiety symptoms.\n\nCurrently, my anxiety has reached a state where I constantly feel pressure on my chest, as if something heavy is building up. This sensation is persistent, lasting 24 hours a day. When I encounter a situation tied to my anxiety triggers, my heart rate increases, and I experience vertigo, numbness in my legs, and bowel issues. Occasionally, I even feel skipped heartbeats.\n\nMy goal is to regain a sense of normalcy, just like I felt 10 years ago. I miss the days when I didn't feel constant chest pressure or my heart racing due to unknown thoughts. I want to travel, enjoy life, and participate in activities like any other person, free from panic episodes. I have tried taking supplements like vitamin D3, folic acid, B12, and iron, but unfortunately, they haven't provided any relief. As a coping mechanism, I find that online games help calm my symptoms, but I spend a significant amount of time engaged in this activity.\n\nI am now seeking advice on how to reach out to a nearby doctor or healthcare professional who can help me with my symptoms. I'm unsure if there is a possible treatment for my condition, but I refuse to believe that I have to continue living like this without any hope for improvement.\n\nIf anyone has had a similar experience or has insights into possible remedies or treatment options, I would greatly appreciate your advice. Additionally, if you could provide guidance on how to effectively communicate my symptoms to a healthcare professional, it would be incredibly helpful.\n\nThank you all for your time and support.

Sorry for the shit quality and obviously *highly scientific* testing methods used, just thought I'd add this since I have it.\n\nI realise cancer is a pretty unlikely outcome at my age, but what else could be causing this? Please tell me I haven't somehow contracted some lethal disease.\n\nTL;DR: Right arm is ~4cm larger than the left one, swelling doesn't look to extend much past my elbow, isn't inflamed or intensely hurting or anything. VERY worried it might be something serious.",

Since then he\u2019s had a few bouts of diarrhea, roughly once a day. He just did a poo that was much more solid, but I noticed it was very pale in colour. Five minutes later he said his stomach hurt again and went back to the toilet, and this time he had a bit of diarrhea again. \n\n[Pic of stool](https://imgur.com/a/fJmwcgr)\n\nHe has had very little appetite since Friday. I\u2019ve coaxed him to eat tiny bits here and there - even some of his favourite treats like cookies and custard - but mostly I haven\u2019t been pushing too hard. He did eat a few forkfuls of two-minute noodles around half an hour ago which I was happy about. He has been drinking a lot of milk, and I started giving him Sustagen in milk yesterday, which he\u2019s been drinking fine. He\u2019s also had lemonade and water. \n\nOtherwise he\u2019s been pretty normal - same amount of energy as usual, no fever or vomiting, sleeping well.

I could start just as easily as stop, I couldn't call myself addicted. I also smoked quite little, +/- 2 joints per evening. These were pre-rolled joints of medium to heavy strength. I never had any problems with this until 4 weeks ago were I ended up in a bad trip after just a few (heavy) smokes. These were the symptoms I experienced:  \n\\- Waves of heat and cold.  \n\\- Numbness on the right side of my face. I even thought it was hanging down and feared a stroke or something.  \n\\- My legs were shaking involuntarily.  \n\\- I looked pale.  \n\\- My heart was racing  \n\\- I felt strange sensations in my head.  \n\\- I felt the life slipping out of me and even said goodbye to my\u00a0boyfriend because I thought I was going to die. :/  \nAt one point I stumbled to the door and told my boyfriend we had to go to the emergency room NOW. Although he panicked at first, he eventually said I was probably having a bad trip and we'd wait and see. He put me to bed and watched and cared for me all night. Fortunately(and obviously\u00a0) I had not died or become unconscious, but I did feel that I was always on the verge of falling away. And besides that, waves of the sensations described above went through my body for hours, although this gradually became less and less. I was extremely tired, but my mind fought tirelessly against the physical violence. At night in bed I kept myself awake for hours because I was afraid to lose control or rather lose myself. The next day I was exhausted, but relieved to be there.  \nI haven't touched a joint since and never will. However, it does worry me that something in me seems to have changed after that moment, both physically and mentally.  \nPhysically:  \n\\- I don't get well with the slightest effort: the blood drains from my face, I get dizzy and I have to lie down to avoid passing out. Sometimes my legs start to shake, but not always.  \n\\-  I feel weak ,light-headed and exhausted.  \n\\- A strange pressure on my head (not painful).  \n\\- I sometimes feel a strong alternation between hot and cold. For example, I was recently shaking under a blanket while it was hot outside, but I can also get a kind of hot flush where I feel overheated.   \n\\- Stomach problems, I suddenly suffer from heartburn which literally runs into my mouth at times.And I also feel tired and weak after a meal, so much so that sometimes I have to lie down.   \nMentally I notice that I feel very emotional, easily frightened, can tolerate little stimulus and feel like I'm in a dream. I also feel alienated from the world around me and also from myself. I feel unsafe and do not know what to do with my complaints. I've already been to the doctor for a few blood tests and based on my complaints, sugar, sediment, thyroid, hb and calcium have been tested. This was all fine and he didn't want to test anything more. My blood pressure was measured and it was relatively low.My concerns have not been allayed and I wonder if this prolonged aftermath is recognizable. Apart from the above, I am relatively healthy at the moment apart from chronic neck pain after an accident. I did have thyroiditis last year and covid in 2020 so my immune system is a bit weak.I don't know if this is relevant, but any bit of information might help. Thanks in advance.  \nLisa  \n",

She was immediately taken to hospital, where she was admitted for 3 weeks. She become lil alright but during the stay she lost appetite, began taking random things and forgetting, lost the bowel control. She basically couldn\u2019t do any task on her own. After being released from hospital she did seemed improving little.\n\nFor a month she improved a lil but she became very much reserved and didn\u2019t liked to talk much but the bowel and  urinal control didn\u2019t improved. She could walk only with the support.When we contacted neuro doctor he said that\u2019s its Parkinson disease. The grandmother i had seen walking faster than girls of my age couldn\u2019t walk in front of eyes. I know old age is inevitable but why it had to happen so abruptly for her. This just tears me out, the lady could carried a 20kg load in front of me was now not in control.\n\nFew days later she developed some rashes which looked painful. Doctor said it\u2019s herpes and steroids needs to be stopped.2 days later she became completely unconscious. Couldn\u2019t even open her eyes. Again she was taken to the hospital. \n\nIt had been a week that her condition didn\u2019t improved although she does become conscious for 1-2 hours a day, but nothing significant improvement despite all the care she is being given in ICU. \n\nDoctor suspected fever is not stopping although herpes rashes have recovered almost. They said it might be some cancer. Her ultrasound revealed tumor in her uterus and also some kinda infection in lungs that might be cancer. Tumor sized 6mm * 6mm  in her uterus might be advanced stage of uterine cancer but they can\u2019t confirm as her body cant deal with biopsy.In 2017, she did had pain but the tumor was 1.5*1.5 her doctor said nothing to worry about.\n\nAfter suspected cancer it has been a week it breaks me within seeing her what\u2019s happening to her. I can see tears in her even she can\u2019t talk with me. Sometime she doesn\u2019t  say a word and sometimes she say unrecognisable words which i make her believe in can understand.It is such a shame i can\u2019t do anything. I tried to make her and was somewhat successful in doing that. But i am afraid these are her last days today her HB dropped to 7. I just can\u2019t imagine myself without her other than trips it is not a single day i havent talked with her.\n\nDoctors say they can\u2019t even  confirm if it\u2019s cancer and even if they confirm it is she has like 10% chance of recovery. It read a blog online on end stage of cancer, her condition truly matches with that. I really miss her i can\u2019t stay overnight with her in ICU, i just want her to be alright again and eat chocolates with me. I know we all are eventually going to day, but why in this way.\n\n\nHas anyone faced such a issue?\nIf there is some doctor in the sub can you please guide me a little in this case?\n\n\nTlDR: my 75 year old grandmother has a suspected stage 4/last stage cancer.

I have been working with doctors for over a year now on trying to understand the nature of my symptoms. In late July of last year, I began experiencing pain and pressure that is focused on the surface of my scalp, my nose, and my temple area. The pain is usually unceasing, reactive to certain movements and postures, and can be worsened by certain things (wearing headphones, for instance, can cause pain to trigger in the area where the headphones are located). Moving my eyes can also be a trigger (in particular, my eyes seem to 'spasm' and then I feel a dull ache behind them for a bit). \n\nI am currently receiving treatment from a headache center for 'migraine', but the constant pain, as well as the attacks, do not align with migraine as I understand it. I have these headaches nearly every day, all day, from the moment I wake until the moment I go to bed. I have tried multiple medications for relief without any so far - topiramate (400mg), zonisamide (100mg), ajovy injections, and now botox injections. \n\nIt feels more like my nerves are on fire, constantly active and extremely sensitive, rather than any headache I have had prior to this starting. The headaches began after receiving a number of dental fillings, and prior to my wisdom teeth coming in last year. After exploring a lot of options, and based on where the pain is located, I am beginning to feel like I have a neuralgic condition - possibly trigeminal neuralgia, focused on the opthalmic nerve. \n\nI wanted to see if I was at least on the right track on where to start the conversation with my doctor, or if there are any other things for me to consider. The pain is unrelenting and has basically caused me to lose any semblance of a social life, and my work performance has suffered drastically. Any help is appreciated. \n\n**Additional demographic data below:** \n\nI have had the following diagnostics: \n\n* Full bloodwork (iron and vitamin b12 was low, have been treated for 3 months) \n* Brain MRI (clean) \n\nI have the following medical conditions: \n\n* Hypothyroidism\n* High blood pressure\n* Obesity (Class III) \n* Bipolar disorder (type 2) \n\nI am taking the following medications daily: \n\n* Levothyroxine 150mcg \n* Estradiol 4mg\n* Lamictal 150mg \n* Zonisamide 100mg\n* Lisinopril/Hydrochlorathiazide 20/12.5\n\nIn addition, I take the following supplements: \n\n* Vitamin D\n* Vitamin B12\n* Iron\n\n&#x200B;",

I have celiacs disease and have been diagnosed for seven years. It is pretty well controlled by diet. Up until last august I woke up one morning and pooped weird (had stattorhea) and my stomach felt really upset. This persisted for weeks, I thought I had food poisoning or something. This turned into extreme inflammation and pain in the intestines for weeks and loud gurgling. so severe to the point where I went to the ER. At the ER they took an ultrasound of my gallbladder but it appeared normal and no blood work pointed to anything. I saw two GIs, with CTS, Colonoscopies, Endoscopies, and many tests on my elastase and calprotectin which were all normal they were stumped. I got a SIBO diagnosis but all of the treatments for sibo didn't touch my symptoms. The only thing of note found on the CT was liver hemangiomas (4) but apparently they shouldn't cause issues. I've seen a functional medicine doc and this has helped me manage symptoms but I still have daily issues. The things that helped the way I feel were B12 injections and taking other vitamins to make up for a loss in fat soluble vitamins. Something called GI revive has helped with the pain and inflammation. Also, eating low fodmap and lower fat foods has helped. However, even on the days I feel good I still have steattorhea. So for a year I have been struggling with daily Steattorhea, much worse with high fat meals. Bloating, switching between constipation and loose stools. My stool has been green, very light brown, to normal. It changes. I am finally seeing a new GI doctor in a couple weeks and I am wondering what I should explore or ask for tests for. I am tired of feeling crappy, not being able to travel, and having to frequently cancel plans. also note \\*\\*I am very careful to avoid gluten and cross contamination from gluten so I don't think it is celiacs.",

A lot of evidence shows us being safe but I just want to double check to make sure.\n\nFor one, we used a condom that was properly worn. When I took it off it had no rips or tears, no semen/fluid, and it was pretty snugly on.\n\nNo penetration was done. I tried to do it but my penis didn't fit. At some point my bare penis touched different parts of their body (back, chest, face) but never their vaginal region\n\nI didn't feel like I ejaculated or orgasmed. My partner also agrees and said she didn't feel anything coming out from it. \n\nOther things include the fact I fingered her. Fingering has a low chance of pregnancy and you need fresh semen in large quantity. But my hands felts dry and I didn't have or see any fresh semen. \n\nPre cum is another worry but I heard pre-cum has little to no sperm to cause a pregnancy. Pre cum also dies off faster when contacted with skin + air.\n\nAnother thing to note is that my GF's ovulation date (by my estimates) would be days before we did it (at least 2-4) so it would be passed by her fertility window.\n\nTL:DR: Worried about pregnancy but a lot of evidence says otherwise. Condom was used, no penetration, no semen, past fertility window.\n\nSo yeah is there still a possibility of pregnancy or no?",

Back in my undergraduate days, I used to experience stomach problems almost daily, such as bloating, gas, loss of appetite, occasional morning vomiting of bile, and other discomforts. However, after college, when I started living on my own and changed my diet, things improved significantly, though I would still occasionally have issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 2021, out of the blue, I had a severe stomach ache one night. The pain was sharp and intermittent, coming and going every 10-15 minutes. It was excruciating, lasting throughout the night. Concerned, I went to the emergency room, suspecting appendicitis. After several tests and a CT scan, the doctors ruled out appendicitis and identified it as a small bowel obstruction with a transition point in the right mid abdomen. The report also mentioned a small volume of ascites, with no free air or abscess.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe doctor was surprised by this diagnosis, as such obstructions are typically seen in individuals who have had prior stomach-related surgeries, which wasn't the case for me. Strangely, a few hours after being admitted to the hospital, I had a bowel movement, and the pain vanished. I was discharged the following day. However, I continued to experience similar pain with heartburn from time to time. Eventually, I noticed that this pain would occur a few days after consuming foods containing lactose. Consequently, I made dietary changes and eliminated dairy from my meals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOver the past two years, I have learned that consuming dairy, lamb, sushi, or fatty meats like goat meat can trigger similar pain. During these episodes, I feel as though something is moving from right to left in my lower stomach, with the pain intensifying as it moves. The pain usually starts anywhere between 3 to 7 days after consuming any of the aforementioned foods and typically lasts for a day or until I have a full bowel movement. The pain is so severe that it renders me unable to do anything else for an entire day. I usually avoid eating and stick to drinking water during these episodes, and sometimes vomiting occurs as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile I've read that the symptoms of lactose intolerance typically manifest within 2 hours of consuming lactose-containing foods, my symptoms appear after several days, making me doubt that it's solely lactose intolerance. My primary care physician suggested that the symptoms seem similar to lactose intolerance and advised me to avoid lactose or try lactaid. However, I'm not entirely convinced that lactose intolerance is the only issue, so I decided to seek additional insights here. It's important to note that I maintain a healthy lifestyle, standing at 6 feet tall and weighing 165 pounds. I occasionally indulge in light drinking and do not smoke. Moreover, I actively participate in regular physical activity, and I don't consume any medication or substances. Considering this, I wonder what other possible reasons could be causing these symptoms.",

I managed to get up and wake up my mom (she was visiting and we ended up having to quarantine together). I told her something felt very very wrong. She called 911. I laid down. By the time the paramedics got there, those symptoms mostly had gone away and I was feeling slightly better. They took my vitals.

Hard to explain too but it\u2019s like I was rubbing them either on rocks or against each other for a long time.\nIt\u2019s the same pulling sensation.\n\nAny time I put my hands above my head or try to reach for something that\u2019s placed quite high, the same happens : my arms hurt a lot,the chest becomes heavy again, I feel suffocated and exhausted.\n\nI am tired a lot, no matter how much I eat or sleep, there is a certain type of exhaustion that doesn\u2019t go away.\nI need a chair to wash the dishes and frequent sitting breaks when doing any lengthy activity.\n\nIt\u2019s not always bad but there are more bad days than good ones.\n\nEvery time I\u2019ve tried to figure out what these symptoms could be, the term POTS shows up in my google searches.\n\nThe thing that makes me reconsider it is the fact that my heart rate doesn\u2019t get very high.\nThe highest it gets when standing or walking is 120 bpm.\nSedentary it\u2019s 60-73 and when standing up it can be either 90/100-120 or just a slight increase 80-92 when the symptoms aren\u2019t as severe.\n\nI have also never fainted (except for one time as a child and we still don\u2019t know the cause).\nI don\u2019t have stomachaches or headaches and don\u2019t feel nauseous.\nI don\u2019t smoke nor drink, I don\u2019t do diets (despite lower weight) and I don\u2019t exercise.",

She was immediately taken to hospital, where she was admitted for 3 weeks. She become lil alright but during the stay she lost appetite, began taking random things and forgetting, lost the bowel control. She basically couldn\u2019t do any task on her own. After being released from hospital she did seemed improving little.\n\nFor a month she improved a lil but she became very much reserved and didn\u2019t liked to talk much but the bowel and  urinal control didn\u2019t improved. She could walk only with the support.When we contacted neuro doctor he said that\u2019s its Parkinson disease. The grandmother i had seen walking faster than girls of my age couldn\u2019t walk in front of eyes. I know old age is inevitable but why it had to happen so abruptly for her. This just tears me out, the lady could carried a 20kg load in front of me was now not in control.\n\nFew days later she developed some rashes which looked painful. Doctor said it\u2019s herpes and steroids needs to be stopped.2 days later she became completely unconscious. Couldn\u2019t even open her eyes. Again she was taken to the hospital. \n\nIt had been a week that her condition didn\u2019t improved although she does become conscious for 1-2 hours a day, but nothing significant improvement despite all the care she is being given in ICU. \n\nDoctor suspected fever is not stopping although herpes rashes have recovered almost. They said it might be some cancer. Her ultrasound revealed tumor in her uterus and also some kinda infection in lungs that might be cancer. Tumor sized 6mm * 6mm  in her uterus might be advanced stage of uterine cancer but they can\u2019t confirm as her body cant deal with biopsy.In 2017, she did had pain but the tumor was 1.5*1.5 her doctor said nothing to worry about.\n\nAfter suspected cancer it has been a week it breaks me within seeing her what\u2019s happening to her. I can see tears in her even she can\u2019t talk with me. Sometime she doesn\u2019t  say a word and sometimes she say unrecognisable words which i make her believe in can understand.It is such a shame i can\u2019t do anything. I tried to make her and was somewhat successful in doing that. But i am afraid these are her last days today her HB dropped to 7. I just can\u2019t imagine myself without her other than trips it is not a single day i havent talked with her.\n\nDoctors say they can\u2019t even  confirm if it\u2019s cancer and even if they confirm it is she has like 10% chance of recovery. It read a blog online on end stage of cancer, her condition truly matches with that. I really miss her i can\u2019t stay overnight with her in ICU, i just want her to be alright again and eat chocolates with me. I know we all are eventually going to day, but why in this way.\n\n\nHas anyone faced such a issue?\nIf there is some doctor in the sub can you please guide me a little in this case?\n\n\nTlDR: my 75 year old grandmother has a suspected stage 4/last stage cancer. In 2017 her tumor size was 1.5*1.5cm (doctor said it is not cancer) and now doctor are saying it\u2019s cancer.",

Currently also lovenox 40mg and corticosteroids that I'm taking as I feel necessary. At the time my PE's happened, my only medication was the propranolol because I was pregnant/giving birth. \n\nI had multiple small bilateral segmental pulmonary embolisms in the upper lobes 5 and a half months ago, immediately post emergency c-section. All clotting workup and autoimmune testing negative, no cause could be identified. No family history either. They told me I had bad luck and this was just a freak 1/10,000 chance event. I'm a scientist with degrees in a couple different medical fields so I knew immediately that I had PE's when they lodged the night after my c-section. My oxygen sat stayed at 100 the entire time so it took 3 days to convince the Dr to take me for the CT that identified the filling defects.\n\nI had some typical symptoms like sense of doom, SOB, tachycardia, sweaty hands and feet, pain when trying to lay down. I also had and still have one that no one can explain- peripheral edema that accumulates only at night. The clots have been confirmed gone for at least 4 months and this entire time I have been waking up in the morning with swelling in my hands, feet and above my upper lip. Thorough cardiac workup showed no abnormality other than consistent T-wave inversion which did resolve after several months. My feet still sweat when I'm having SOB and if I drink too much coffee or something it becomes very hard to breathe which is new since the PE's.\n\nI took the lovenox prophylaxis for the 3 months but still suffer from PE symptoms in the absence of clots and my d-dimer and protein C shoot up drastically every time I attempt to stop lovenox so I still take it several days a week. This isn't normal for a provoked, post-surgical incident that resolved months ago. My lung sounds are sometimes clear, and sometimes obstructed for no discernible reason. Upon looking at the CT's myself I discovered what I believe to be vasculitis and started self-treating with decadron or prednisolone I had at home which helps my pain and breathing tremendously. I'm waiting for follow-up with pulmonology for them to review my scans. The Albuterol they gave me at initial visit did not help. I'd like for them to give me a flovent inhaler so I can stop with the systemic steroids as it's very unhealthy and not sustainable for me long term. My symptoms come back when I reduce or stop steroids which I've been taking for about 2 weeks now.\n\nAll of the specialists I've seen are stumped as to what is happening to me. Why did my PE's resolve and then morph into a long-term, ongoing vasculitis type of condition? Why the nocturnal peripheral edema which resolves as the day goes on?",

Please let me know if I don\u2019t cover any relevant info. \n\n\nMe: 30\u2019s F, 5\u201910\u201d, 285 lbs. Retail worker. I was walking 5+ miles a day at work with no issues prior to this incident. \n\n\nIncident: While at work I was using a hydraulic lift cart to load merchandise into a customers vehicle. The merchandise was about 200lbs. The cart has a flat bed and a handle at the back for steering and the bed raises/lowers with a foot pump. \n\n\nThe customer stopped halfway backed in and was trying to speak to me. I locked the cart and stepped off the curb to hear him. While speaking to him I heard a noise, almost simultaneously he said \u201coh shit lookout\u201d and I felt something slam into my shin and land on my foot. \n\n\nThe cart had rolled off the 6-8inch curb, tilted forward and launched the 200lbs box into/onto my foot. The cart was elevated so this box fell about 3 feet. \n\n\nThe customer had to help me get the box off my foot and when I attempted to walk my leg buckled and I sort of kneel fell. \n\n\n\nThe injury:\nI was wearing composite toe work boots so the arch of my foot ended up taking the brunt of the impact. Immediately my ankle swelled but the bruising was fairly minor. It hurt to walk, specifically it hurt to go from toe to heel in a normal walking motion. \n\n\nI went to an urgent care the day after (there were difficulties getting paperwork from them). They did x rays and identified a minor fracture of the medial malleolus and put me in a walking boot.  I attempted to return to work in the boot but the pain was awful and not helped by OTC pain relief. \n\n\nThis occurred about four months ago and I am still dealing with pain and a very loud clicking/popping noise with each step. I have been doing PT. An MRI and was done and found nothing significant except that I have a spare foot bone/os trigonium. \n\n\nObviously this ended up going through workers comp. I am seeing a podiatrist who does not want to address the clicking nose and is of the opinion that I am recovering well. \n\n\nI am frustrated because the popping noise is constant and painful. I feel like something is out of place in my foot and that this will worsen with time. \n\n\nTLDR; foot got crushed. Minor fracture to the medial malleolus. Os trigonium/spare bone present. Four months on foot making loud, constant popping noise when walking, painful. I am a layperson but the pain/noise is around the superior/inferior extensor retinaculum and radiates up the left/outside of my shin (left foot). There is also nerve damage and numbness that comes and goes. \n\n\nWhat could be causing this?  Is there a test or type of imaging to further investigate? They want me to settle but I am concerned this will need surgery down the road.  I am pending a second opinion appt. \n\n\nThanks for reading! I will gladly answer any questions.",

There\u2019s a lot to this \u201cstory\u201d but I\u2019ll try to keep it short.\n\nAfter MULTIPLE conversations with my mom, dad, siblings, & extended family members, I decided to go with my mom to see her PCP. This first appointment was right around a year or so ago. I explained our concerns to her doctor, he examined her, asked her several questions. \n\nShe shared that she knew what she wanted to say, she just couldn\u2019t seem to get the words out. She blamed her behavioral and emotional changes on her inability to communicate the way she wanted to. Which is understandable given that my mom has always been very outgoing, social, & the \u201calpha dog\u201d in our family. \n\nThe doctor\u2019s explanation was worded \u201cif you don\u2019t use it, you lose it\u201d \u2026 meaning that during the pandemic & months following, she was communicating FAR less than usual & it took a toll on her speech. He concluded that she likely had aphasia\u2014specifically Broca\u2019s Aphasia. He recommended speech therapy, a CT scan, & seeing a neurologist. \n\nMy mom refused speech therapy. She still does. But she agreed to the rest. \n\nThe CT scan revealed a minor stroke, which we initially believed to be the cause of all her symptoms. But then she got an MRI & finally got in to see a neurologist. This appointment was a few months ago. \n\nThe neurologist looked at her MRI, her CT scan, her chart, etc\u2026 basically everything. He conducted several tests in his office & examined her himself. Then he told us: mom\u2019s frontal lobe is deteriorating. She has primary progressive aphasia, a type of dementia. \n\nA few points he made:\n- The stroke was completely unrelated. \n- She\u2019s not going to get better & there\u2019s no way to know how quickly she\u2019ll get worse, but she WILL get worse. \n- If she\u2019s adamant about not doing speech therapy, it\u2019s okay to let it go. It might slow the progression of her speech troubles, or it might not, but it wouldn\u2019t improve them. \n\nFor the last year, i & my family have been grieving someone who is still very much alive.

I am desperately seeking external advice after a long string of prescriptions and doctor's visits. Any help would be appreciated tremendously. \n\nBackground (a bit long and detailed, apologies in advance)\n\nI am 21f, Asian, 125lbs, with no history of any diseases/health conditions and fairly healthy. I was taking oral contraceptives initially but stopped after being prescribed my first round of antibiotics.\n\nFor the last two months, I've been suffering through numerous treatments for an ear infection I acquired in my right ear at the end of May. My first symptoms included a feeling of fullness in my ear to the point my hearing was impaired and gooey/watery discharge. I went to urgent care where they prescribed me amoxicillin for a middle ear infection.\n\nThe amoxicillin seemed to work and the symptoms abated, but after taking the last dose my symptoms quickly returned. I went to my GP on Jun. 6. To continue treatment for the middle ear infection, I was prescribed Z-Pak which I took for a 5 days. I was also given a referral to an ENT. Symptoms returned after the Z-pak, so I called my GP who prescribed me Levofloxacin. I stopped taking this after 2 days, because they made me incredibly nauseous. \n\nMy ear was feeling full again so I went to a different urgent care where they said I had an external ear infection instead and prescribed me TobraDex ear drops. I was using the drops when I went to see the ENT, and they did stop my symptoms. The ENT said my ear looked fine, so I left feeling my issue was resolved.\n\nA few days later my ear felt clogged again and luckily I could see the ENT right away. She said it seemed like a fungal infection so I used  clotrimazole and finally, everything seemed fixed. I had a final check-in with the ENT on July 12 where she gave me the okay.\n\nCurrent Situation \n\nOn July 20, I began to notice a slight pain when I pressed my intertragal notch or pulled my earlobe. Over the last few days this pain has gotten steadily worse. It is not really debilitatingly painful when left alone, but it is very uncomfortable and achy with the occasional stabbing pain. The side of my neck below my right ear feels stiff and I sometimes have a very low grade fever around 99.5-101 degrees. I also feel sensitive and get mild headaches.\n\nThis feels completely different from my previous infection where there was zero pain/itching, only a clogged sensation and discharge. Now, my ear feels dry, but it is painful to the touch. My guess is this is actually a bacterial external ear infection whereas it was fungal before? \n\nFor the last 2 days, I've been using my remaining TobraDex drops, but I haven't noticed any substantial improvements yet. I can't really go see a doctor right now because of extenuating circumstances. \n\nI tried taking some pictures of both ears and I am worried my right ear canal looks weird. Is this a normal swelling to be expected of an external ear infection or something else? \n\nI'm so tired of driving 45 minutes to see my ENT and taking all these antibiotics. Any suggestions are appreciated. \n\nOther Information \n- I am not a frequent swimmer and have not swam at least a year.\n- I have never had an ear infection prior to this.",

Frequently needing to urinate, and when I do, I get that feeling that I still need to urinate afterwards. Slight abdominal aching and strong smelling pee. I\u2019ve had a few now so I know the feeling but I typically wait until they are BAD and I am in pain to treat.\n\nAs soon as I woke up this morning I took three at home tests. All very positive for leukocytes and negative for nitrites (deep purple). I then chugged two bottles of water and went to the minute clinic. \n\nMinute clinic gives me a urinalysis. Negative for leukocytes and nitrites but there are trace amounts of non-hemo blood. I told them about the three at home tests and they said all three could have been false. My pee was CLEAR by the time I took the test at minute clinic, so I think dilution could have been a factor. \n\nThey prescribed me antibiotics anyways but I\u2019m a little concerned. My regular doctor doesn\u2019t have appointments available for over a month\u2026 Could I have diluted my pee enough for a negative result? \n\nFor reference - ph of 5 and 1.020 spec gravity, negative pregnancy test, I\u2019ve had a UTI with negative nitrites and trace blood before but never non-hem\u2026",

        "context": "Ears pulse and whoosh, concerned about aneurysm or fistula - tests included\n**About Me:** 39F, 5'7\" 122lbs, white\n\n**Medical Diagnoses:** Costochondritis (mild, comes and goes), major depression, OCD\n\n**Current Medications:** Prozac 20mg (started only a month ago), Xanax 0.5mg as needed\n\n**Current Supplements:** Vitamin D, Vitamin C, fish oil, CoQ10, Lipo Flavanoids (started a few days ago just to see if they help)\n\n**Lifestyle:** Never smoked, drink on occasion (one drink only when I do), active/exercise regularly\n\n**Primary Complaint:** Constant 24/7 high-pitched hissing tinnitus that is sometimes pulsatile. The constant tinnitus is in both ears, though the left ear is often louder and sometimes has an additional tone.\n\n**Details about the pulsatile tinnitus:** The tinnitus is usually constant, but becomes pulsatile when I:\n\n* **Bend over** \\- I'll get about 5 seconds of pulse-synchronous whooshing in both ears. It's not a low-pitched ultrasound noise, it's like my hissing tinnitus pulsing along to my heart (ssssSSSSsssSSSssSSSsssSSS)\n* **Stand up quickly** \\- Again, about 5 seconds of pulse-synchronous whooshing in both ears\n* **Turn my head all the way to the right** \\- Same, about 5 seconds of the whooshing\n\nIf I maintain the positions above, after the 5-ish seconds, the pulsing stops and the tinnitus hisses normally, non-pulsatile. If I'm upset, it can take longer.\n\nOther times it is pulsatile is doing hard cardio **exercise**... this is when it pulses the most, I hear 3-5 seconds of whooshing (both ears) on every other exhale when my heart rate is raised and pumping hard. Otherwise, I feel GREAT when I exercise, my heart rate recovers quickly when I stop, no headaches or weakness, etc.\n\nSometimes, I hear the pulsing inside my tinnitus when I first wake up in the morning, or when I wake up from a vivid dream. This can sometimes take a little while to calm down and is sometimes louder, or only, in the left ear.\n\nThe constant tinnitus is extremely somatic. I can make it louder by turning my head to the right, bending my neck all the way back, pushing on my forehead, jutting my jaw out, etc. I can even 'fake' the exact sound it makes when it's actually pulse-synchronous by doing these movements... the sound is the same.\n\n**The weirdest thing:** during the times the tinnitus is pulsing, I can STOP the pulsing by closing my teeth together. I CANNOT stop the pulsing by pressing anywhere on my neck or throat (I know that's a common test for vascular PT)  I also cannot make a recording of the pulsing, which tells me it is probably a subjective noise and not 'real'.\n\n**Duration of Complaint:** 2-3 years, I don't know exactly, but it's been going on for quite a long time.\n\n**Factors to Consider:** I have a history of going to air shows and concerts without ear protection. I also used to work wedding receptions. For the last several years I have been using AirPods on my 6-7 mile daily walks, and I definitely had the music up way too loud to hear over traffic/outside noise. I know this is why I have the constant tinnitus. What I don't understand is why it is sometimes pulsatile. I protect my hearing now.\n\n**Tests I have had:**\n\n* **Brain MRI, with and without contrast, with IAC protocol:** totally clear and 'normal'\n* **Blood tests:** not anemic, liver and kidney function fine, thyroid levels are normal. Vitamin levels were not tested.\n* **Blood Pressure:** runs low if anything, has never been elevated when measured\n* **Hearing Test:** All thresholds normal, symmetrical hearing, including some extended high frequencies tested\n* **LDL/Tympanometry:** Normal LDLs and normal pressures\n* **Vestibular tests:** found a slight unilateral hypofunction on the RIGHT side, which is my 'better' tinnitus ear.. test was done to diagnose 24/7 rocking dizziness for a few months post-COVID infection. I've since 'compensated' for this and no longer feel dizzy.\n* **Chest CTA/EKG/Echocardiogram:** These were done last month because of a bad septic pneumonia infection, not because of the pulsatile tinnitus, but everything was perfect so I'm including it here just to mention that there probably isn't a cardiac concern.\n* **Eye Exam:** included digital images of my optic nerves, no papilledema seen\n\nI never cared about the noise before until I started being anxious about it, but now it causes me a great deal of anxiety and I listen to it constantly. I feel like I can habituate to it again if I could remove the anxiety that something is really wrong, since Googling 'pulsatile tinnitus' leads you down some scary rabbit holes, which is why I started seeking a doctor to begin with.\n\nI've been seeing an ENT/Neurotologist specialist, who I thought would be the best person for this due to his hyper-specialty but he seems unconcerned about my specific symptoms? I had to push for even the standard contrast brain MRI. He thinks if my PT was anything super concerning it would only ever appear in one ear and would be a more constant 24/7 thing.\n\nI think all of you doctors on here are so generous with your time and expertise, and I'm hoping you can give me some basic advice... **with my specific symptoms should I just put this to rest, or should I be seeking more scans ( brain MRA or carotid ultrasound?) And how urgently should I be seeking this out?**\n\n**Major Concerns:** a dural arteriovenous fistula, carotid cavernous fistula, or an aneurysm. I know the scan that I had wouldn't be able to fully diagnose those things, but would it at least raise any red flags that would give my doctor reason for further testing?\n\nI'm really, really struggling with the anxiety. It's led me to restart Prozac after saying, years ago, that I'd never go back on another SSRI.",

I went to urgent care a few days later once I was able to get out of bed. They tested me for everything in a regular STI panel. All negative except BV and Trich. I wasn\u2019t really experiencing symptoms just slight burning and paranoia because I did not recall anything from that night or exactly what was done to me. I had a cold sore at the time (HSV1 positive since I was 8) so it freaked me out that it spread and I asked to get tested for HSV. They didn\u2019t swab me but did blood test instead. Never heard back from them. 4 weeks passed and I decided to look up my results and saw I got a low positive for HSV2. Immediately I started to freak out. Few days later I started experiencing the following symptoms :\nLower back pain, leg pain, back and leg tingling, a burning skin sensation all over my pelvic area including Mons pubis and hips that goes down my legs and knees. I kept vigorously checking myself for sores and started having left labia pain, prickling and tingling. No lesions or sores ever appeared. Sometimes my hips hurt like they were displaced and my tailbone aches. These feelings are constant all day. \n\nI went through the rabbit hole of HSV testing and learned about false positives. 12 weeks after the incident I paid for the western blot and I was positive for hsv1 (which is known) and negative for hsv2. I also got multiple swabs in areas that I thought were red or irritated. All negative.\n\nHowever, my symptoms persist and doctors don\u2019t know what to tell me anymore. \n\nSo far I\u2019ve had:\nBack ct, pelvic mri, brain mri (to rule out ms) I do have spinal stenosis and some bulging discs. Got sent to physical therapy and it helped a little. Steroids did nothing. \n\nEach time I have a \u201cflare up\u201d it lasts months. The first one lasted for almost 3 months. I am now going on 4 weeks of this nerve pain, pricking all over my pelvic/genital area/ back pain, hip pain. \n\nMy neurologist thinks I have fibromyalgia as sometimes the burning spreads to my ribs and arms but it\u2019s mostly constant on the lower half of my body.\n\nI am uncomfortable and miserable where i can\u2019t even wear certain clothes because they just hurt or make me feel a weird scrappy feeling all over my legs and pelvic area. Gabapentin doesn\u2019t do much or I don\u2019t take enough. I literally can\u2019t live my life normally anymore. I have 2 little boys and all I can ever do is sit or lay because that\u2019s the only time it\u2019s not hurting so bad. I feel like I\u2019m failing. \n\nWhat can this be? What doctor should I see next? \n\nI still get worried my HSV tests were somehow wrong\u2026 but I\u2019ve never had a \u201coutbreak\u201d even after weeks of symptoms.

        "context": "(25M) More than six months of diarrhea, loose stools, and nausea. I need help.\nHello, \n\nI would like to ask for your help or advice. I have never had any problems with my stomach or digestion, even though I sometimes went to the bathroom more frequently, usually due to stress, stool was normal. However, this is a different case. At the end of November 2022, one morning, I woke up with diarrhea and spent the whole day sitting on the toilet. The stool was completely watery, and I had never experienced anything like this before. The next day, I felt better, but in the following days, I still had loose and watery stools. Whenever I ate something, within a few minutes, my stomach started rumbling, and I had to go to the bathroom again. The same thing happened when I was lying flat on my bed, with an awful rumbling sensation in the upper part of my stomach the whole time.\n\nIn the following week, I also started experiencing mouth nausea and a feeling of vomiting, despite I never vomited. I woke up in the morning already feeling nauseous and had to rush to the toilet, just like before, with watery stools. I must mention that during the time these problems started, I had, and still have, psychological issues (depression, due to other matters), and at that time, I was taking a combination of antidepressants, which I changed in various ways after consulting with a psychiatrist, so I initially attributed it to that. Continuing on... In December, I underwent routine examinations with my doctor, such as blood tests and stool tests, and then I had an ultrasound, but everything was fine. However, the symptoms persisted into the new year; it was terrible, with constant nausea, a persistent feeling of vomiting in my mouth, and pain in the upper abdomen. Eventually, I went to see a gastroenterologist, where in January, they conducted all possible tests and examinations, including gastroscopy and colonoscopy, but everything came back without the slightest finding or problem.  \n\n\nOne note, the gastroscopy was incredibly difficult for me, as I constantly felt nauseous in my mouth (sensing it somewhere behind my tongue, at the beginning of my throat). I had an intense urge to vomit, and after the gastroscopy, I struggled for several weeks with significant stomach pain and diarrhea, similar to the beginning. The nausea was immense, just dreadful. A week later, I had a colonoscopy, and despite a one-day cleansing with laxatives and the like, my intestines were completely contaminated with watery stool (I saw it on the camera).\n\nTo summarize the gastrological aspect, all my results were normal, and the doctor didn't know what was wrong with me, so he prescribed some pills containing mix of: Calcium carb, Codein, Papavereni, Sacharin Albi, Miscle fiat pulvis. I took them in the morning and evening, and although they made my stool firmer, it still looked bad (yellowish color) and had a strange smell. Moreover, they caused increased nausea in my mouth. In the meantime, in April, when I had had enough of everything, I decided, with the doctor's agreement, to stop taking all antidepressants completely and cleanse my body. I felt slightly better, but it probably wasn't the cause. I was frustrated, so I made an appointment with an infectious disease specialist, and I got tested for all possible viruses, sexually transmitted diseases, and even things like HIV, hepatitis, and so on, but everything came back negative.\n\nI forgot to mention, at the end of January, I noticed (until then, I had never looked at it) that I had a terribly thick, white coating on my tongue, and it has been there for six months now. I thought it could be candidiasis, as I had previously been diagnosed with it from swabs on my penis, but this time I had swabs taken from my throat and tongue, and the finding was negative. I also read that e-coli bacteria can cause watery diarrhea, but I don't believe they would miss detecting it in my tests.\r  \n\r  \nBasically, I'm currently lost and desperate. It's not as bad as it was at the beginning, but I constantly feel either nauseous, have loose stools, or experience pain in the upper part of my stomach. It seems to me that everything I eat is processed in my stomach instantly and moves on. It's like an extremely accelerated metabolism, and I never feel emptied.  \n\r  \nThe stool is colored yellow and has an unnatural smell. No complications with the gallbladder or pancreas were found. Recently, I was examined for immunology, and milk intolerance was detected, but I don't think it had an impact on this issue. Additionally, some weakened immune cells were identified, and I have started taking Imunor. For the past few months, I have been regularly consuming probiotics and various combinations of vitamins, without success. I tried changing my diet, but it doesn't seem to have any effect. Simply put, since the end of November, something has completely changed in my digestion; my stomach feels heavy within half an hour after eating, and so on.\n\nIf you have any further questions or if there's anything else you're interested in, I'll respond to everything in the comments.\r  \n\n\nThank you for reading..\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\n\n&#x200B;",

It was a new type of operation, so I was doing 1-legged hops as an exercise to track my recovery, slipped and fell, and my left leg turned into a spaghetti noodle. \n\nX-ray showed a complete mid-shaft fracture and follow-up CT showed a small fracture in my left acetbulum as well. Work-up showed no malignant causes.\n\nI had an intramedullary nail w/ interlocking screws put in 1.5 days later.\n\nOver the last 9-months, I have been in significant amounts of pain in my lateral hip/gluteal area and middle of my leg. Walking more than a few blocks had me in agony, and my exercise was limited aside from physio and indoor cycling. I've had many injuries and surgeries, and never had pain like this (appendicitis, broken right arm twice, many sutures, torn ACL and meniscus in the right knee leaving arthritis, torn rhomboid, dental implants, resolved cubical tunnel syndrome in right elbow, etc).\n\n4 weeks ago, I had a follow-up appointment and learned my femur had NOT healed at all, and was a non-union. Cause was unknown, and I was referred to a trauma surgeon who I see next week because my surgeon doesn't deal with non-unions. \n\nDo these x-rays look acceptable? The bones look quite far apart to me, but I am no expert. Could anyone provide some insight in to what I could expect at this next appointment? I am going in blind besides what I've researched online regarding options. \n\nThank you everyone! \n\nX-rays: https://imgur.com/a/uOxZ5YM",

        "context": "Seeking guidance for persistent anxiety symptoms - advice and treatment options\nI am a 33-year-old male, currently living in the USA. I am reaching out to the community for some information and guidance regarding the physical symptoms I have been experiencing, which have been progressively impacting my life for the worse. I've tried to keep these symptoms hidden for some time, but recently they have become unbearable, leading to extreme health issues.\n\nI have been dealing with anxiety for nearly a decade. In the early years, I considered it a normal sensation that would pass after a few seconds. However, as time went on, the duration and intensity of my anxiety increased significantly. It became associated with certain physical attributes, such as heights or open spaces, leading me to avoid such situations. Over the years, my brain has linked anxiety to many variables, causing me to restrict various activities to avoid triggering anxiety symptoms.\n\nCurrently, my anxiety has reached a state where I constantly feel pressure on my chest, as if something heavy is building up. This sensation is persistent, lasting 24 hours a day. When I encounter a situation tied to my anxiety triggers, my heart rate increases, and I experience vertigo, numbness in my legs, and bowel issues. Occasionally, I even feel skipped heartbeats.\n\nMy goal is to regain a sense of normalcy, just like I felt 10 years ago. I miss the days when I didn't feel constant chest pressure or my heart racing due to unknown thoughts. I want to travel, enjoy life, and participate in activities like any other person, free from panic episodes. I have tried taking supplements like vitamin D3, folic acid, B12, and iron, but unfortunately, they haven't provided any relief. As a coping mechanism, I find that online games help calm my symptoms, but I spend a significant amount of time engaged in this activity.\n\nI am now seeking advice on how to reach out to a nearby doctor or healthcare professional who can help me with my symptoms. I'm unsure if there is a possible treatment for my condition, but I refuse to believe that I have to continue living like this without any hope for improvement.\n\nIf anyone has had a similar experience or has insights into possible remedies or treatment options, I would greatly appreciate your advice. Additionally, if you could provide guidance on how to effectively communicate my symptoms to a healthcare professional, it would be incredibly helpful.\n\nThank you all for your time and support. I look forward to hearing from you and hopefully finding a path towards relief and recovery.",

I\u2019ve worn a mask when possible but it\u2019s a crappy medical mask, not and industrial one.\n\n16th - earliest that the gunky mucus and headaches could have started, but might have been the 17th\n\n18th - full swing head cold. Producing loads of green gunk. Full on social distancing and washing hands like it\u2019s covid.\n\n21st- gunk starts to subside, throat becomes really painful and raspy\n\n22nd - covid test : negative. Throat now worse. Since then the gunk has almost disappeared, is only slightly green and mostly just watery.\n\nPresently: still raspy as hell, can\u2019t hit the high notes my dog has learnt means dinner time / time to come in , so he just continues to run around the garden til he\u2019s bored haha\n\nPharmacist suggested that the cold might have been protecting my throat and now it\u2019s gone / going so hence the bad throat from dust.\n\nSituation is I need a decision by this evening and in a strange way it\u2019s a case of damned either way because my housemate has a week immunity system but the friend I made plans with is 74 and sings in a choir so doesn\u2019t want his voice ruining\n\nWhat to do?

        "context": "I'm gasping for 2 weeks now\n23yo m,5'10,75 kg.Smoking less than 5 cigarettes a day.I was really excited to see my friends for the first time after 5 years. I went to the airport,entered the plane. When the pilot announced takeoff, I suddenly couldn't breathe properly. I had travelled with plane 7-8 times, so this was a first to me. I lost control of myself and told the hostess that I wanted to get off the plane immediately. They first asked if there was a doctor among the passengers, luckily, there was one, unlucky for me, she couldn't help me. I grabbed my luggage and rushed outside the airport, but i was still gasping. Went to the train, still gasping. I was gasping the whole 1 hour ride. I didn't want to go home, asked my friend if I could stay over, she agreed. I was still gasping and at that point, it was fucking annoying. I stayed there for 3 days, had a panic attack on the second day of my visit, felt fucking ashamed that I was weak and troubled my friend. I left after that day, took a bus, still gasping. I was about to collapse on my way to home, but I told myself that if I make it to the house,it'll be okay. It wasn't okay at all. I realized that I can't even go outside anymore. I've been staying at home for 2 weeks now,and it feels fucking awful,like a new kind of low. I booked an appointment to the doctor, but any doctor in my country takes too long to get a in appointment, so the earliest I can go is August 10th. I can't afford going to a private hospital too,so the best I can do is ask here.Why does this happen?\n\nEDIT:Thanks for all the responses.I'll be going to the private hospital this wednesday.I'll be selling my guitar for the fees,but at this point I don't care as long as I can breathe normally again.I will keep you guys updated on wednesday.\n\nEDIT 2:For those who are telling me to immediately go to the hospital,if I could,I would.The nearest public hospital is a fucking joke,even the patients who's lying on the floor half-dead are ignored by the \"doctors\".Even if you get in,it's a merely 1 minute examine,since there's always a 1000 people in line.The private hospital costs around a minimum wage,which I don't have any at the moment.So in order to go,I have to wait for the buyer to buy my guitar at wednesday.Turkey is in a crisis right now,so you can't \"immediately\" go to a hospital unless you are way well off.Sorry for the blast off,it's only meant for the higher ups in this shithole.",
